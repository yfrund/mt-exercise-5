A few years ago, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk>
And the idea is pretty <unk>  <unk> of four need to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> must be <unk>
And, even though it turns out it it turns out to be <unk>  because these <unk> <unk> people to work very <unk>
And because I <unk> this is an interesting idea --  I decided to take it in a design <unk>
And it was a big <unk>
<unk> I did this <unk>  in about 70 design <unk> around the world  with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and even with <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk>  gives us deep <unk> -- in how people <unk>  and I want to share a few of those <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the first step  that people <unk> on the time.
They are talking <unk> for what it looks like to be <unk> <unk>
And then they <unk> <unk>
They <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Most of the time they build  <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And on the <unk> when the time is almost to <unk>  <unk> somebody <unk>  they <unk> it <unk> it <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They <unk> their work.
But what really <unk>  is that the <unk> changes in a <unk> <unk> <unk> because it <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> people have <unk>  more of those <unk> <unk> than <unk>
What of the <unk> are just <unk> with a <unk>
They <unk> they play <unk> <unk>  and they make pretty <unk>
And of course, there are <unk> <unk>  which is a lot more <unk>
And at the best under them are <unk> <unk>
That's <unk>
And <unk> tells us that they're not only doing the highest <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what you're going to be <unk>  How can <unk> Why? What do that <unk>
<unk> answer is:  <unk> of the kids are <unk> <unk> <unk>
They <unk> no time with <unk>
But there's another one.
And that's the <unk> <unk> are <unk>  to find the only right <unk>
And then they <unk> that <unk>
But what <unk> when they <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  is that they don't have time <unk> And <unk>
It's a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What <unk> <unk>
is that they start with the <unk>
They build <unk> and new <unk>
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> so that they have more <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> this form of <unk> <unk> <unk>
In every <unk> the kids get <unk>  about what <unk> and what did not work.
So the <unk> of <unk> is very important.
But let's see how different <unk> do it <unk>
The average for most people is about 50 <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> do it <unk> but not much better.
<unk> better than most <unk>
Who does it <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>
The highest <unk> that I've seen was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> Because they understand <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> something better than <unk>
But now it's <unk>  if you <unk> a <unk> at the team <unk> they get <unk>
<unk> You see the team and <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can see that <unk> And <unk>
Because they are good to <unk> <unk>
They understand it.
And every team that's good <unk> is <unk> and attention to the work --  will <unk> the <unk> of that team will <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>  lead to a <unk>
If you normally have 10 <unk> this <unk>  will have six a <unk> <unk>
And I tried something <unk>
I <unk> we make it some <unk>
So I was <unk> 10,000 dollars to <unk> <unk>
And what do you think this <unk>
What <unk>
It <unk>
No team had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> for example, a <unk> <unk> <unk> had been enough to <unk> <unk>
<unk> that a higher <unk>  big <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> <unk> with the same <unk>
And what do you think was <unk>
So now they understand the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And this team changed of the <unk> team in one of the <unk>
They made the highest <unk> in the <unk> time.
So that's a good <unk> for us  about the nature of <unk> and <unk>
You might ask you, <unk> Why would somebody spend a <unk> <unk>
And the reason I do the work is to make digital <unk> and <unk>  to help <unk> <unk> in building <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> helps them to get behind the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  each project has its own <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the best <unk> to make the best <unk>
And so this is the value of the experience of this very simple <unk>
And for who is <unk>  <unk> go to <unk>
And in this <unk> you can see  how to build the <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are examples of how people around the world,  <unk> and <unk> have <unk>
There are also <unk> <unk>
And the fundamental <unk> I think, is really a <unk> <unk>
It <unk> the <unk> of all of our <unk>  and we think of our best <unk>  and <unk> for the challenge for us.
And sometimes a little <unk> of this experience --  already to change <unk> <unk> <unk>  in a <unk> <unk>
And that makes a big <unk>
Thank you very much.
So let us <unk> that we <unk> about a <unk>  a big <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> machine  and it's a <unk> <unk> machine --
And everyone here needs to <unk>
You can go through the time or <unk> <unk> in time, but not <unk> here and <unk>
And I'm <unk> what you would <unk> because I <unk> the last time -- this question of all of you <unk> and they want to go back.
They all want to go back to the time before cars or <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't know.
I'm <unk> that there is a certain <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
And I can come in there.
But I don't hear <unk> I should say that.
I don't want to <unk> and not because I'm so <unk> --  -- but I think of the <unk> of this planet.
They're not going to <unk> <unk>
So I also want to go into the machine and I want to <unk> <unk>
We live in the <unk> time on this planet  which <unk> you want to <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> was a time like <unk>
My <unk> <unk> all around the <unk>
My <unk> <unk> all the <unk>
And my parents are already with the <unk>
So I should be <unk> in a lot of a lot in the <unk>
But it's not even about us.
There's a lot more on the <unk>
A child child who is born in New <unk>  has been born of the <unk> man in the world.
Think about that. That's an incredibly <unk>
And why is that <unk>
The <unk> The <unk> have billions of people on this planet of life.
They had a influence on the <unk> of this world  bigger than the <unk> of <unk> which <unk>
But they're not <unk> They are <unk>
We have <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> world <unk>  that <unk> a generation ago a generation of millions of people <unk>  that are not <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
You know someone here <unk>
<unk> modern <unk>  our <unk> to <unk> billions of our <unk> are all <unk> of the scientific <unk>
And for me is the scientific <unk> <unk>  the <unk> of things, or it works and let it <unk> <unk>  one of the biggest <unk> of the <unk>
That's the good <unk>
But <unk> is that the only good news -- because there are another number of other <unk> they were already <unk>  and one of them is that, even though though our <unk>  there's still a billion people <unk> to go to <unk>  in this world, every day.
Their Their <unk> is <unk> and it takes a <unk>
And not only that, we have <unk> our <unk> to <unk> this world <unk>
<unk> water, <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  they're <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>  and if we don't <unk> us to <unk> us by <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk>
And the question is <unk> we <unk> I think of that?
I think it's clear that we're able to be able to <unk> for food  to <unk> <unk> without the country that we live from <unk>
And I think we can <unk> this world of <unk>  who don't <unk> it in the <unk>
I believe that <unk> and, no, that's not a <unk>
But now is that I <unk> up in the morning --  one of the things I <unk> up at night <unk>
<unk> we've been so <unk> <unk> of scientific <unk> <unk> and never have been able to use it to do as we <unk>
We are on the <unk> of the most amazing <unk> of all kinds of <unk>
And yet I really think we should say hundreds of <unk> but 300 years,  to <unk> <unk> to the time of the <unk>  to find a time of time that we <unk> <unk> <unk>  that we <unk> this <unk> and more <unk> than <unk>
People are <unk> their <unk> with a <unk> <unk> that it is impossible to <unk> them.
And <unk> everybody has right on his own <unk>  but you know where everybody has the right on a <unk>  but you know where you don't know where you don't <unk>
You don't have a right on your own <unk> No, you <unk>
And I did a little while about it to <unk> me.
A <unk> years ago, I wrote a story about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> New <unk> a short story.
I was too <unk> <unk>  against what was actually the most <unk> <unk>  to the public health in the history.
And I didn't know what <unk>  So I only wrote a story and went on.
And a little bit later, I wrote a story about  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk> this <unk>
People were <unk>
So I also wrote a story of <unk>  and I couldn't understand this  and I could not understand this  why they thought the <unk> of <unk>  on a <unk> instead of a <unk> <unk> rather than a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But, you know, I <unk> I wrote a story and I wrote a story and I was talking about to the order of the day. And I was <unk> we <unk> it, we're going to eat it, and that's that.
But these stories <unk> me <unk>  I could not <unk> <unk> but I could not <unk>
And I think because those <unk> who were <unk> me <unk>  in fact, no <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> <unk>
just like the people in this <unk>
And it was just that <unk> me so <unk>
but then I thought, you know, let's be <unk> <unk>  We have been on a <unk> in this world --  which we have no more the same <unk> until <unk>
We talk about <unk>
We talk about it as between <unk>
<unk>
OK, there are reasons and I think we also know.
We are the <unk> in <unk> <unk>  in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in science <unk>  and there is no reason why <unk>
You just have to <unk> a couple of <unk>  and the people understand it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  not good <unk> <unk>
I mean you can <unk> your <unk> <unk>
There are questions and problems with those people  which we thought they were right.
So <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But now comes <unk> If you <unk> <unk>  you have to <unk> them and we are not so good.
And the reason I can say that is is that we now in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that we hope them to live as <unk>
<unk> 12 years back,  there was a <unk> story that was a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk>  and the <unk> against <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> to <unk> or this <unk>
And it was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The data came <unk>
They found in the United States in <unk>  in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> <unk>  and all over the same <unk> not in the <unk>
But it doesn't <unk> it does not <unk>  because we believe <unk> to <unk> <unk>  we believe what we see and what we see and what we really think <unk>
We can't <unk> <unk> to a lot of <unk>  of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> us from data <unk>  and I can come in there and I think we can all that.
But you know what?
The <unk> were <unk>  <unk> and to do this <unk>  The United States are one of the <unk> countries in the world  where the number of <unk> against the <unk>
That's a <unk>  and we should be <unk>
<unk> Is <unk>
What is our <unk>  that we could <unk> <unk>
Now, I understand it. I understand it.
Who is <unk>
<unk> anyone of this audience ever see somebody die of <unk>
<unk> not <unk>
And here not more,  but it happened last year in the world.
That's a lot of dead by <unk> <unk> <unk>
But because it's no longer going to be able to <unk> the <unk> and people as a <unk> <unk>  of fear of fear and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>  of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they can do that because they can't do any <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
They don't understand that these are the same <unk> but it <unk> never really are.
And that's something we need to learn how to <unk> and we should <unk>
This man was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He <unk> us from one of our <unk> <unk>
No <unk> no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the guy in the <unk> also <unk>
It's called <unk>
He developed a <unk> against the <unk> with some other people.
It <unk> the lives of a <unk> to <unk> children  in the third world.
<unk> right?
<unk> it's good, except that Paul <unk> with <unk> <unk> and how <unk> they are.
and that people should be <unk> to <unk>
And so he <unk>
So Paul is a <unk>
If he <unk> a public <unk> <unk>  it can only be in <unk> of <unk>
It gets home <unk>  because there are people who are <unk> to <unk> it to say that they know where his children are <unk>
And <unk> Because Paul <unk> has <unk>
I don't <unk> it to say, but <unk> are <unk>
Take them away and the <unk> will <unk>  <unk> <unk> and that's what is happening now.
We have in this country back.
And it gets more <unk> <unk> will be <unk> to die as there are enough the disease <unk>
And they will not just <unk> <unk>
What about <unk> <unk>
And a <unk> <unk> wrote me a few weeks and said to me some <unk> <unk> <unk>
No one has ever <unk> me.
She didn't <unk> her child <unk> against <unk>
<unk> no <unk>
<unk>
Why? Because we have no more <unk> And you know what?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But, who <unk> <unk> <unk> there might someone on an <unk> in <unk> <unk> and he <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> he <unk> a <unk> <unk> and comes to <unk> <unk>  where he <unk> to one of that fantastic <unk>
And he didn't realize that he is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and we don't know it, because it's going to do that.
That is the planet that we don't live <unk>
We would rather <unk> us to <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody <unk> are <unk> <unk>
<unk> a little <unk>  to <unk> the day by <unk>
I know because half the Americans are doing it every day.
They <unk> it and they use <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it doesn't matter how often we <unk>  <unk> they are <unk>
And the data always <unk> it again.
They make your <unk> <unk> And <unk> never more than that.
<unk> if you want to <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk> <unk>  Dan is that way.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Why are we doing that? Why are we doing that?  I think I <unk> we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> We <unk> that <unk>
That has to be <unk> our <unk>
They're that for millions of our <unk>
They're <unk> <unk>  and <unk> even for <unk> under us that they can <unk>
So we go from <unk> and where are we <unk>
We <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I love <unk> <unk>
But, you know, this is very <unk> because the whole <unk> is <unk> and we give billions of <unk> of <unk>
I have some of those things here.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I don't even know what that is, but we give billions of <unk> of <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And you know what? If I'm starting to tell this people me --  and they say, "What can you do it <unk>
They feel good <unk>
And you know <unk> You are <unk>
Because it can't <unk> me to <unk>  or the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk>  that says, <unk> I'm not going to give a <unk>
or one or one or other <unk> who wants to be <unk>  with <unk>
If you start with evidence and science --  <unk> by <unk> and <unk>  <unk> you where you didn't want to <unk>
And then you come into the <unk> Africa of <unk> <unk>
He is responsible for death of <unk> <unk> of his people --  <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> than the <unk> resources that can <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  in a country that has been <unk> <unk> by this <unk>
<unk> not tell me  that these things have no <unk>
They <unk> they <unk>
Now is the most <unk> <unk>  which we are now <unk>  the <unk> between <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> food  and the <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> It's got to <unk>
It's about words, <unk>
It's not a <unk> <unk>
<unk> we <unk> every <unk> <unk> <unk>  every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  each <unk> is <unk> by human <unk>
<unk> <unk> that there were no <unk> <unk>
There no <unk> no <unk>
Even no <unk> They all come from us.
We <unk> them in the course of the last <unk> <unk>
Some of those products and others are not <unk> it.
We <unk> our <unk> of what our <unk>
Now we can do the same in a more <unk> way.
And, <unk> there are <unk> to <unk>
But we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> of millions of <unk> can live  and live <unk>
You don't want to <unk>
I should say I <unk>
We don't want to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk>
Well, this is the whole <unk> -- too much more <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> we don't want to <unk> <unk>  with the same <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't like companies that are <unk> in living things.
We don't want to <unk> the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And you know what I <unk>
You have <unk> Let's do something about it.
It's true. Our <unk> is <unk>  but that's not a <unk>
It has nothing with <unk>
This is about <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is not <unk>
No country.
Even no <unk> it's a <unk>
It's a <unk> and sometimes it doesn't work.
But the idea that we need to do science <unk>  to do the work, because we're <unk> to be <unk>  is really <unk> <unk> and <unk> millions of people <unk>  <unk> to get to the only <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the next 50 years  we'll need more food than <unk> <unk>
70 percent.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in Africa for the last 30 years.
<unk> <unk>
They really need it and we <unk> it.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's just a lot of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> no <unk> like <unk>  and scientists are <unk> <unk> to do something about that.
<unk> people can eat without <unk>
They wouldn't be <unk> and know your <unk>
That would be <unk> It wouldn't be <unk> <unk>  but it would be <unk>
And everything I would say is <unk>  Why are we <unk>
I mean, let's <unk> why are we <unk>
Because we don't want to <unk> with <unk>
This is about <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with our <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>  <unk> our <unk> to <unk> more and eat <unk> <unk>
It's not about <unk> <unk>  It's about people in life.
and it's <unk> that we start to understand what it wants to say.
<unk> do you know <unk>
If we don't do it and <unk> as we are <unk>  than we are <unk> to something that we don't want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I don't find any other way to <unk> this <unk>
It's <unk> and <unk>  our <unk>  our <unk> and we really have to do something about it.
So after this <unk> <unk> <unk>  would you want to <unk> <unk>  would you like to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I want to that.
Now she's still in the <unk>  but we have an amazing <unk>
We can <unk> that <unk> for everything we want to <unk>
We can bring them to a future that we <unk>  and we're going to bring them to where we <unk>
We need to <unk> with these <unk> and we need to keep <unk>  but if we go back and <unk>  we'll be happy that we have done it.
I know that we <unk>  and that's what I think is something that the world needs to know.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> walked on a <unk>
by the center of <unk> <unk>
when he <unk> beautiful music <unk>
That came from a <unk>
A black <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> on a <unk> with only two <unk>
I tell you something that many of you already <unk>
because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk>
for a book.
Robert <unk> <unk> <unk> the role of <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk>
who have been <unk> <unk> had to <unk>
because he was <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
and 30 years later, he <unk>
by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
You should read <unk> or the <unk>
Not just for the beautiful <unk>
that <unk> between these two <unk>
But also to see what music <unk>
a <unk> <unk> if I can <unk> that <unk>
to get <unk> from the street <unk>
I met <unk> in <unk>
two years ago, in a <unk>
He had <unk> to a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
and came <unk> and <unk>
He was <unk> on a <unk> and social <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> said that the <unk> would never <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
in the last part of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We talked about <unk> <unk> I was a <unk> of <unk>
who wrote that <unk> would like to have a <unk> <unk>
You need to know that <unk> doesn't want to be <unk>
And when he was <unk> he was <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
and it has him for his life <unk>
And the result is that he <unk>
<unk> of <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
and he <unk>
He <unk> <unk> <unk>
and lives with that <unk> and the <unk> in his <unk>
that <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk>
when we <unk> with our first <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
He was <unk>
He <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
and somebody who wanted him in <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk>
Not for <unk> I was <unk>
I would <unk> him <unk>
that he would <unk> in such a <unk>
and I would be <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
If I started talking about <unk>
and <unk> and other <unk> <unk>
of what you <unk> <unk>
So I started <unk>
I <unk> the first part of the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> I <unk>
I saw a <unk> <unk>
in the eyes of <unk>
It was like a <unk> <unk> his work <unk>
A chemical <unk> that my <unk>
the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
In <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by a <unk> <unk> he <unk> <unk> <unk>
and began to play <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
I had to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We started talking about music of <unk>
to <unk> and <unk>
<unk> all the <unk>
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
I saw in that he was not <unk>
a <unk> <unk> knowledge <unk>
but he was <unk> by that <unk>
He talked about it with the same <unk>
and the same idea as I and <unk> <unk>
of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
By making music music and <unk>
That was <unk>
of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
that <unk> of the <unk>
of <unk> <unk> was <unk>
in a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
For <unk> music is a <unk> <unk>
It can be <unk>
and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
in <unk>
So <unk> <unk>
<unk> are <unk>
I saw that the <unk> of <unk>
That's why we make music music <unk>
That we have something that in all of us.
<unk> in our <unk>
Our <unk>
And we go through our <unk> <unk>
<unk> our <unk> that can <unk> <unk> to <unk>
The reality of that <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We are <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk>
It was <unk> a group of friends back.
The <unk> power of music brought him to <unk>
in a family of <unk>
who <unk> him <unk>
those are <unk> <unk>
and it <unk>
I'll always do music with <unk>
<unk> it now in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
or on <unk> He <unk> me <unk>
why I'm <unk>
<unk>
Thank you.
Robert <unk>
I want to play something that I <unk> from <unk> <unk>
<unk> me.
I am <unk> <unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
For 10 years I make online <unk>
And my goal for the <unk> <unk>  is to make it very easy to save the world in real life --  as it is in <unk>
Now, I <unk> a <unk>  and I have that plan to <unk> more people, all of you <unk> to <unk> more time <unk> to <unk> more time to <unk> <unk>
And at this moment, we play three billion <unk> a <unk> <unk>
Some of you think <unk>  <unk> a lot of time to <unk> <unk>
<unk> too much time,  there is so many important problems in the real world that should be <unk>
But actually <unk> my research at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> billion hours a week is not enough to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, I believe that if we want to <unk> the next century.
I have <unk> that we need in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> per <unk>
That's probably a <unk> idea,  so I will <unk> it to say it <unk>
If we want to solve problems like <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I believe we need to try to play <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> billion <unk> online <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> This is a pretty good <unk> -- why <unk> are so important to survive the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
So he <unk> a camera for <unk> as she <unk>
And this is a <unk> <unk> at the <unk>
Now, if you're not a <unk>  you'll probably be some <unk> in this <unk>
You probably see the sense of <unk>  a little <unk> but also <unk> <unk> <unk>  a deep <unk> to <unk> a very difficult problem to <unk>
If you're a <unk> you'll be a <unk> <unk> <unk> around the eyes and <unk> around the eyes and <unk>  is a <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> that <unk> at the point of something called a <unk> <unk>
<unk> you know that. Okay, good.
So we have a couple of <unk> under us.
A <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that is so <unk>  that you didn't know it was that it was possible until you <unk>
It was almost not too <unk>
And when you're there are you <unk>  to discover what you really <unk> That's a <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> at the point of <unk> <unk>
And this is the face that we have to see  on millions of <unk> around the world, as we try to <unk> the <unk> of the next century.
The face of somebody <unk> against all the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But <unk> we see this <unk>  in the face of <unk> life as we try to <unk> problems.
This is what I said, "I'm not <unk> In the <unk> face <unk>
And this is what I'm doing is <unk> you <unk> <unk>
This is me, "I <unk> It's not <unk> In the <unk> face <unk>
This is a piece of <unk> in my old <unk>  in <unk> <unk> where I did my <unk>  about why we better in <unk> than in real life.
And this is a problem that have a lot of <unk>
We don't feel that we're not very good at the reality that we are in <unk>
And I mean, with good not only <unk> even though there is part of it.
We are <unk> in <unk> But I mean,  but I also mean with good <unk> to do something that <unk>  <unk> to work together.
And when we are in a <unk> world,  <unk> I believe that most of us -- the best version of ourselves is the most <unk> to <unk>
the most <unk> to <unk> as long as it is to <unk> a problem after a <unk> to <unk> a <unk>
And if we live in the real life <unk>  when we <unk> are <unk> with <unk> we often feel <unk>
We feel <unk> We feel <unk>
We might feel <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
We have those <unk> never as we play <unk>
they are just not in <unk>
So that's what I <unk> when I was a <unk>
<unk> part of <unk> it makes it impossible --  that we can't <unk> all <unk>
How can we <unk> that <unk> of <unk> <unk>  and they <unk> in the real world.
So I <unk> <unk> like <unk> or <unk>  that is really the <unk> <unk> <unk> to solve problems.
And I started to <unk> a few things --  that make <unk> possible in the online world.
The first thing I <unk> is that every time you in one of those online <unk>  especially <unk> <unk> or <unk>  very much <unk> <unk> are <unk>  that you would like to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But not just a <unk> a <unk> that is perfectly <unk>  of your <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, you can do it.
They never give you a challenge that you don't <unk>
But it's on the <unk> of your <unk> So you should be <unk>
But there's no <unk> in <unk> or <unk>
You can't sit somewhere <unk>
There's always something <unk> and <unk> that should be done.
And there are also very much <unk>
And every place you <unk> there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to help you, to <unk> your <unk> <unk>
That is something that we have in the real life, <unk>  that sense that <unk> within our <unk> are very much <unk>
And also that there is a <unk> story that tells us why we are here and what we do.
And then all the positive <unk> that we <unk>
You've heard of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> we don't get in real life.
When I <unk> this <unk> I won't get a <unk> of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't get in real life.
Now, the problem with <unk> online <unk> like <unk> or <unk>  is that the <unk> <unk> is that the <unk> is <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>  that we <unk> all of our time to <unk> online <unk>
It's just better than the <unk>
So to have <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> all of <unk> <unk> million years old, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, that's not a <unk> <unk>
It may be <unk>
Just to <unk> that <unk>  <unk> million years ago, our first human <unk>
That was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay, so if we talk about the amount of time we <unk>  in the <unk> of <unk> is the only way it <unk>  to think about it is <unk> by talking about time in <unk>  in the context of the <unk> of human <unk>  which is a <unk> <unk>
But it's also <unk> because it turns out that we <unk>  <unk> so much time to play with play <unk> <unk>
We looked at some kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
This is true. I believe this.
So, think about this <unk>
It was <unk> by a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The average young person in a country with an important <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> will have 10,000 hours of <unk>  against the time he is <unk> years old.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting <unk> for two <unk>
<unk> for children in the United States is  <unk> <unk> hours of the <unk> amount of time you you <unk> in school from  the <unk> <unk> to your <unk> <unk>
So we have a <unk> <unk> job of <unk> <unk> -- which <unk> as much learning about <unk>  as they do about all the rest in school.
Some of you probably have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So you probably have heard of his <unk> <unk>  the 10,000 <unk>
It's on this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that if we can <unk> 10,000 hours of <unk>  <unk> study in order to <unk> the <unk> that we can <unk> in <unk>
We will be a good <unk> in <unk> we're doing the <unk> of the world.
And so, what we're seeing now is a whole generation of <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk>
So, the big question is,  <unk> are <unk> so good <unk>
Because if we can get <unk>  would we have a <unk> <unk> of human <unk>
This is the number of people who are now in the world --  <unk> one hours a day.
These are our <unk>
500 million people who are <unk> good at <unk>
And in the <unk> <unk>  we're going to have a billion <unk>  more <unk> that are <unk> <unk>
If you don't <unk> it <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> to develop <unk>  that little <unk> <unk> and with <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> <unk>  so <unk> of all over the world,  <unk> in <unk> China and <unk> can play <unk>
They expect a billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That brings us to <unk> billion <unk>
So I was <unk> in which we <unk> by this <unk> <unk>
I have four <unk> The first is <unk> <unk>
Okay. You can see this as <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the want to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> a <unk>  <unk> with the <unk> that we have an <unk> chance of <unk>
<unk> always believe that a <unk> <unk> is <unk>  and it is always worth <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> not.
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> social <unk>
There is a lot of <unk> <unk> is that we would rather have people after we have a game with <unk>  even though they have <unk> us at all.
The reason you need to play <unk> to play with somebody <unk>
We <unk> that they're going to be <unk> with our time <unk>  that they're going to play with the same <unk>  that they're going to play <unk>
So a play with somebody <unk> <unk>  the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
And as a <unk> we actually build <unk> social <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, there is a reason that the average <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's because we know that when we play a game <unk>  we actually are <unk> to work hard hard to work  than if we <unk> or somewhere around it.
We know that we are made of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> work.
And <unk> are willing to work, if they're always <unk> the right work is <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> would like to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> a little <unk> to make that <unk>
You all know <unk> the biggest <unk> in the world.
The second largest <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk>  is the <unk> or <unk> <unk>
<unk> million people use it every <unk>
They have more <unk> about <unk> or <unk> together --  on the Internet than any other <unk> by another <unk> by another <unk>
They build a <unk> story.
They build a <unk> source of knowledge  about <unk> or <unk>
Okay, so that are four <unk> that are <unk> to one thing.
<unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And these are people who believe that they're <unk> <unk> to change the world.
And the only problem is that they believe  that they're able to change his <unk>  and not the real world.
That's the problem I'm trying to <unk>
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
His work is <unk> He <unk> the reason  why people spend so much time and energy and <unk>  money on online <unk>
And he says, <unk> his <unk> of nothing less than  a real mass <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And he's a <unk> he's a <unk> so <unk>
And he <unk>  I am a <unk> <unk> I'm a <unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
But he says that this is all <unk>  because <unk> can reach more in a online world than in real life.
They can <unk> social <unk>  in <unk> than in real life.
They get better <unk> and feel more <unk>  in <unk> than in the <unk>
So he says that it's perfectly <unk> is that  <unk> more time in <unk> <unk> than in the real world.
Now, I'm also going to <unk> that is <unk> in this <unk>
But it's not a <unk> <unk>
We need to do the real world in a <unk> <unk>
So I take my <unk> of something a little <unk> <unk> years ago.
These are <unk> <unk> made from <unk> <unk> <unk>
For we had <unk> <unk>  we had <unk>
And this <unk> the first piece of <unk> for that <unk> to <unk>  designed by people.
And if you work the <unk> of the old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you might know this story.
the <unk> of the first <unk> and why they <unk> it.
<unk> says that <unk> especially who were <unk> with <unk>  <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> was the <unk> so <unk>  that the <unk> of <unk> to do something <unk>
People are <unk> people <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk> They had to find a <unk> <unk>
So, she said, <unk> they found out of <unk>  and <unk> a <unk> <unk>
One day, <unk> <unk>
The next day, everybody <unk> <unk>
And they would be <unk> <unk> in their <unk>  because <unk> are so <unk> and <unk> us under such <unk>  that they <unk> the fact that they didn't eat <unk>
The next day, they <unk>
The day <unk> <unk>
And to <unk>  <unk> they <unk> this 18 years.
They <unk> a <unk> <unk> by <unk> one day and eat the next day.
Now, I think this is exactly how we use <unk>
We use <unk> to <unk> the real world.
We use them to <unk> of everything that is <unk>  in the real world, everything that is not <unk> to the real life, and we get what we need from <unk>
But it doesn't have to <unk>
This is very <unk>
And after 18 years of <unk> <unk> was not better.
So the <unk> decided they would play a last <unk>
They <unk> the whole <unk> in <unk>
They <unk> one <unk>  and the <unk> of that play on a <unk> <unk>
They would <unk> <unk>  and look for a new <unk>
Like just enough people <unk> to survive <unk>  the <unk> who were <unk>  and <unk> <unk> they could <unk> the <unk> somewhere <unk>
Now, this sounds <unk> right?
But <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> that would lead to the <unk> <unk> <unk>  the same DNA as the old <unk>
And so scientists have <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> have found evidence of a <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this <unk> could be <unk>
It could be that they have their <unk> by <unk> by <unk> to play <unk>  and <unk> to a play for 18 years --  and it was so <unk>  and we knew so much about it together by <unk>  that they <unk> their whole <unk> in that way.
Okay, we can do that.
We play <unk> since <unk>
It was the first <unk> <unk> <unk>  of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> It was 16 years ago.
They <unk> with <unk> for 18 years,  we play <unk> over 16 years.
I say we're ready for our own <unk> <unk>
Now, they <unk> half the population of people go for a new world.
So that's where I <unk> my <unk> billion hours a <unk>
We <unk> half the <unk> of our <unk>  to <unk> an hour a day.  until we <unk> problems in the real world.
Now, I know what you <unk> "How are we going to <unk> those <unk> by <unk> Well, that's where I have my work on <unk> the last few <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> in our building in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> us from how we should <unk> with the future.
We don't want to <unk> it.
We want to <unk> it.
We want to give us the best <unk> <unk>
And then we want to give people the power to make that <unk>
We want to <unk> <unk> <unk>  and then people give the resources to <unk> their <unk> <unk>
I'm going to show you very <unk> three <unk> that I've made a <unk> of people who are a <unk> to <unk> people  the <unk> to create their own <unk> in the future.
Okay, this is <unk> <unk> <unk>
We made this <unk> in <unk>
This is a online <unk> that you try to survive a <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> is <unk>  but we <unk> enough online to make you believe that it's really <unk> and to believe that it's really and to make you live your real life as if we have <unk> <unk> <unk> so if you <unk> the <unk> <unk>  <unk> you tell <unk> your <unk> <unk>
And then we give you <unk> <unk> and  data that you show what the <unk> price of oil is <unk>  which is not available how the <unk> is <unk> <unk>  how <unk> is <unk> <unk> or <unk>
And you need to <unk> how to live real life as if this was <unk> And then we ask you to <unk> a <unk>  to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And we <unk> them for three years.
And I can tell you that this is a <unk> experience.
<unk> want to change his <unk>  just because it's good for the world or because we would <unk>
But if you <unk> them in a <unk> <unk>  and they <unk> we have no oil <unk>
This is a great story and <unk> to <unk>
<unk> <unk> to see how you would <unk>
Most of the <unk> <unk> they <unk> in this <unk>
So, for the next <unk> <unk> <unk> we decided to <unk>
We made a game called <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was that a <unk> <unk> <unk>  that people had <unk> <unk> years on <unk>
This <unk> of course had the name  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We asked people to get online  almost like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> a <unk> <unk>
You have the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>  and they need to save the world.
But in our <unk> we have instead of five people on the <unk> <unk> everybody on the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it's your <unk> to find the future of energy from energy from <unk>  the future of <unk> <unk> the future of security and the future of <unk>
We <unk> people play the play for eight <unk>
They <unk> 500 creative solutions  that you can see if you look at Google <unk>
And then the last <unk>  We bring it on three <unk> This game is made in <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> the <unk> you will be <unk>  by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with <unk> <unk> Africa,  and we <unk> them to teach social <unk>
We have a <unk> We have a system with <unk>  in skills like <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> vision and <unk>
I'd like to <unk> you all <unk>  to share this game with <unk>  all over the world, especially in <unk>  that could <unk> from the <unk>  to save their own social <unk> to save their own social <unk> to save the world.
So I'm going to <unk>
I want to ask a question.
What do you think is <unk>
We have this great <unk>  we have these <unk> that are ideas of what we could do, but not have the real world.
Well, I hope you're going to be <unk> with me, that <unk> is a human <unk>  that <unk> we can use to <unk> the real world.  that <unk> are a powerful <unk> for <unk>
We have this incredible <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> the ability to <unk> a <unk> social <unk>  this sense of <unk> <unk> and it <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I really hope that we can come together --  to play <unk> <unk> that make a difference to this planet is another century.
And my hope is that you <unk> with me in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
If I look forward to the <unk> <unk> I know two things <unk>  that we can <unk> every future that we can <unk>  and we can <unk> every game that we want.
So, I <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> only time I'm interested in  the <unk>
That can be <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> your <unk> the same <unk> if I <unk>  that's <unk> that <unk> is <unk> <unk> by someone <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> have a <unk> in certain <unk>  the <unk>
<unk> because the person thinks in <unk>  that <unk> him a <unk> <unk>  or something <unk> <unk>
For the <unk> with <unk> for example,  if one <unk> somewhere somewhere in <unk> it gets a <unk> <unk> <unk>  it <unk>
<unk> that's <unk>  is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
To make sure that we understand each other,  I want to show you a very simple <unk>
And I'm going to show how it works. This <unk> is certainly since the <unk> in each <unk> in every <unk> for children.
I <unk> him as a little boy at the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
I'm going to do the <unk> and then I <unk> it.
And then I <unk> why I <unk> him.
This is what happens.
The <unk> that you can <unk> my <unk> that you can see.
I'm going to <unk> it in my <unk> <unk>
I'm going to <unk> my <unk> <unk>
And to make sure that there is nothing in or my <unk>  I'll be here in my <unk> <unk>
And you see that there is no <unk>
That's how long I <unk>  can nothing in and come out of my <unk>
The goal is very <unk>
I'm going to keep my hand --  and <unk> if it's good <unk>  will be the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is so <unk> even as <unk>  I can <unk> it, and it doesn't <unk> on the <unk>
<unk> comes in or from my <unk>  no <unk> And you can <unk> <unk>
<unk>
And this <unk> I often often think about young children  who are in <unk> because you can learn a lot about <unk> by <unk> it.
Even the <unk> very simple <unk>
<unk> many of you are these <unk>
This is what happens.
I love it in my <unk>
I say I tell my <unk> <unk>  to make sure there's nothing in my <unk>
That's <unk>
The reason I <unk> my <unk> <unk>  is because <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And at the time that my hand --  of your <unk> <unk> my <unk> of his original place to one  which is so <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
That's how it <unk>
And if I <unk> my <unk> my <unk>
We can talk about why this is this <unk>  why you're not <unk> that there are <unk> but three <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's because the brain is <unk> in a way of <unk> it is not <unk> two, three <unk> but <unk>
But it's not really <unk> right? And then I do my hand.
And of course, the <unk> is not by <unk> <unk>  but by <unk> the <unk> of my <unk>
And if I <unk> my hand is the same thing.
And if I <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> I can <unk> my <unk> <unk>
I <unk> this hand <unk> You <unk> the <unk>
A beautiful thing that you can do for friends and <unk>
Well,  Well, what does this do with the <unk>
<unk> a year ago, I <unk> a <unk> I <unk> a <unk> <unk>
So I'm not a <unk>  so I was this <unk>
It turns out that if you <unk> a <unk> <unk>  in the form of a white <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like the form of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that no of both <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But a white <unk> is not as good as a <unk>
<unk>  I got really <unk>
But to <unk> it can be <unk>
It turns out that <unk>  even more <unk> than any <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> on one and <unk> on the other <unk>  is better than a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not as good as three <unk>  I can't <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the <unk>
<unk> play a <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And for the <unk> <unk>  we have to go to the <unk>
Yes, right? It's a <unk> with some <unk> <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk>  that you <unk> in a <unk>
This is a very powerful <unk> in his <unk>
It's a lot of <unk> than the white <unk>
We show a <unk> <unk>  when we can <unk> <unk>
The point is,  the white <unk> is not as good as the <unk>  not as good as the <unk> is not as good as good as the <unk>
And no of all has a real <unk> <unk>
<unk> you believe it makes it really  in your body and <unk> a <unk> <unk>
I wanted to look if I could have that idea --  in a <unk> <unk>
I wanted to take something that is a <unk>  and it really <unk>
We know from that <unk>  that when you <unk> reality you have to go to the <unk>
This is a <unk> of almost 18 <unk> It's <unk>
I'm going to <unk> a little <unk> here.
This is my <unk> This is not a  <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is my <unk> This is not <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to <unk> my <unk>  and this <unk> through my poor <unk> until I'm <unk>
If you <unk> <unk>  or if you <unk> <unk> <unk> I did this <unk> for a few friends and also what people I didn't <unk>
A woman was <unk> almost from her <unk>
So I <unk> that if you're <unk>  that you are <unk>  that you <unk> the next <unk>  Do you <unk> I'm going to do the first <unk> <unk>
You can look <unk> but <unk> if you <unk>
This is what happens.
<unk> my <unk>  I do a little <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And then by my <unk> a piece of <unk>  and then <unk> up the other side,
Well, in <unk> we are in the same situation  if with the <unk>
<unk>
But you can now my <unk> right?
I'm going to show you. Here is two,  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
I know people think if they see this.
She <unk> <unk> <unk> is not <unk> enough to <unk> themselves for a few minutes of his <unk>  Let me give you a <unk>
What does that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know.  The people <unk> the room would say, <unk> I didn't have <unk>  People in the other room now are going to get closer to the <unk>
Let me show you this from <unk> <unk>
That's really my <unk> That's not a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's my <unk> I can <unk> some <unk>
<unk> If it's too much <unk> you know, <unk> and not look at that <unk>
People <unk> the room or people later at the way later at the <unk> of the <unk>  <unk> looks like a beautiful <unk> but if it was actually --  -- there is a hole and there was a hole and there would be a hole and there was a hole and there would be a <unk>  Let me <unk> for you.
Yeah, it is.
<unk> <unk> I would <unk> the <unk>
I was going to show my <unk> and you there's no <unk>
But in this context of <unk> and with the idea of something that <unk> is <unk> and it really <unk>  <unk> I'm going to just <unk> the <unk> and I just <unk> the <unk>
And the next days I'm going to see <unk> <unk>
<unk> you look at that. Thank you very much.
I have a lot of fish <unk> in my life.
I have only two <unk>
The first one that was more like a <unk> <unk>
It was a beautiful <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> on the <unk>
What a <unk>
In fact,  it was <unk> fish to the <unk> highest <unk> of <unk>
So you felt good at the <unk>
I had a relationship with this beauty over a few <unk>
And one day <unk> the head of the company and asked me if I wanted to speak on a <unk>  about the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> I <unk>
And here was a company that was trying to <unk>  that this <unk> problem for our <unk> was <unk>
How do we <unk> <unk>
In the last 50 years  we have the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's hard to <unk> the <unk>
90 percent of the big <unk> that we <unk>  the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  they're <unk>
There's almost nothing about that.
So, how bad it is <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> is part of our future.
<unk> there are a lot of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> most of them <unk>  they're <unk> <unk> <unk>
A big <unk>
It has a <unk>  of 15 to <unk>
That means that it means <unk> <unk> <unk> fish is <unk> to get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
And it's not very well.
So here was finally a company that was trying to do it.
I wanted to <unk> them.
The day for the <unk>  <unk> I <unk> the head of the <unk>
Let's call it <unk>
<unk> I said, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> you are known  because of it so far in the <unk> that you don't <unk>
<unk> <unk> said, "We are so far from the <unk>  that the <unk> of our fish are <unk>  and not <unk>
And he <unk> <unk>  "We are in fact, a <unk> <unk>
That <unk> <unk> <unk> he said, <unk>  <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> against one <unk> What <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> I <unk> And <unk> the phone <unk>
And I was <unk> in <unk> and I thought,  which is in <unk> a sustainable <unk>
So the next day, <unk> I <unk>
And I said, <unk> what are examples of sustainable <unk>
He said he was not <unk> He would be <unk>
So I've been on the line with some people in the <unk>
No one could give me a <unk>
<unk> I finally <unk> the <unk>
Let's also call it <unk>
<unk> I said, "What are a few examples of sustainable <unk>
<unk> he <unk> a few <unk> and a few <unk>  and then he said, <unk>
I said, <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
I said, <unk>  of your <unk> is <unk>
<unk> <unk> two percent.
<unk> that's about 30 <unk> said <unk>
And I said, <unk> what is <unk> <unk> to <unk>
There was a long <unk> to the line  and he said, <unk> is just too much <unk> in the <unk>
My love for this <unk>
No, not because I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I did.
No, I <unk> my love for this fish <unk> I <unk> it,  after that <unk> <unk> the fish <unk> <unk>
This second <unk>  that's a very different <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk>  the kind of <unk> that <unk> you have to know more of your <unk>  you get more of the <unk>
I <unk> him for the first time in a <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It has <unk> us <unk>
And he came up with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> had <unk> to <unk> it.
<unk> twice <unk>
<unk> <unk> he was <unk>
Who can do a <unk> <unk>  after he <unk> too <unk>
I <unk>  but this <unk> <unk>
Let's call it <unk>
In fact, his name is <unk>
And no, he doesn't have the fish <unk> and he's not a <unk>
<unk> not in the way you and I <unk>
He's a <unk>  in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
On the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And to the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of <unk>
She <unk> <unk>  on what was actually <unk>
They did that by <unk> the <unk>
They <unk> a <unk> <unk>  and they <unk> the water of the land the <unk>
It didn't want to <unk>  not <unk>
And <unk> it was a <unk>
90 percent of the <unk> went <unk>
<unk> for these <unk> are a lot of <unk>
And so in <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  the country <unk>
What did <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> <unk>
They literally <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> of water out of water <unk>  they were using the <unk> to <unk> <unk>
They put the <unk> under water.
They <unk> a <unk> big <unk> --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk> <unk> --  and at the same time have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is <unk>
I mean, you've never seen something like this.
You look at the <unk>  that <unk> far away is <unk> and all over the <unk> <unk>  and this <unk> rich <unk>
Not so long ago I was there with <unk>
He's a great <unk>  <unk> Charles <unk> and one <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> There are <unk> <unk> by the <unk>  I <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And here he <unk> a <unk> <unk>
Now he <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>
And here, he can see a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It turns out that <unk> the most of his <unk>  <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how he  such a <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> I don't know.
I'm a <unk>
And then he was so <unk> about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> me not <unk> it was really <unk> <unk>  some kind of biological community <unk>
It was <unk> but I was <unk>
And my head <unk> at the  <unk> piece of <unk> fish that I had the <unk>
So I <unk> him. I said,  <unk> how did it that your fish are so good <unk>
He went to the <unk>
"I know, <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>  the <unk> it's <unk>
But what eat the <unk>
What is the <unk>
And then he goes to me with me  that it is such a rich system --  that the fish they would eat what they would eat in the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The system is so <unk>  it's completely <unk>
There's no <unk>
<unk> heard of a <unk> who don't <unk> her <unk>
<unk> that day, I was talking about this <unk> with <unk> <unk> and I said, <unk> a place a place that is so <unk>  <unk> <unk> you <unk>
And at that moment, it was like a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
And we went to the <unk> and saw the most amazing <unk>  thousands and thousands and thousands of <unk> and thousands of <unk> <unk> as far as you could see.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> to their <unk> <unk>
They're <unk>
<unk> I was totally <unk>
I said, <unk> they're not <unk> on your <unk>
<unk> said <unk>
<unk> 20 percent of our fish and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> year had this area  <unk> <unk> <unk> more than <unk> different <unk>
It's now the biggest and one of the most important  and one of the most important <unk> has become very <unk>
And I said, <unk> a <unk> that does it <unk>  not the last thing you want to <unk> on a <unk>
He <unk> his <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> food <unk>
The <unk> food <unk>
So how do it <unk>  how better it <unk>
OK, let's just <unk>
A <unk> who are animals not <unk>  and a <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the <unk> of his <unk>
A <unk> but also a <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> that <unk>  that should be <unk> <unk>
They <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> where the <unk> are better to build <unk>
Every <unk> they fly  <unk> miles to the <unk>
And every <unk> they fly back.
They do that because they can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
No <unk>
I <unk> a <unk> <unk>  so I looked at <unk>
I said, <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> they <unk> that for the <unk>
And he looked like I just like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> They do that to <unk> the food <unk>
I didn't have the <unk> of my <unk> fish still <unk>  which was great and I <unk>
I don't like <unk> I don't love it.
It's that <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
But when I <unk> him in that <unk> in <unk>  <unk> he didn't go at all.
He <unk> <unk> and <unk>  as if you <unk> a <unk> out of the ocean <unk>
I said to <unk> and he was <unk>
He said, "The <unk> works like a <unk>
It's the last <unk> before something the body <unk>
He is <unk> to <unk> <unk>
And then he <unk>  <unk> our water has no <unk>
<unk> A <unk> who are <unk> not <unk>
A <unk> that <unk> his success <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I realized that when he said, <unk> a <unk> who has no <unk>  <unk> a big <unk> <unk> <unk>  because the water <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
That's a <unk> that <unk> of everything with <unk>  <unk> that <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as it was <unk> by the system of <unk>  and <unk> the water <unk> then then it <unk>
The system is so healthy that the water.
So not only a <unk> who are animals not <unk>  not only a <unk> that <unk> his <unk> <unk>  to the health of his <unk> but a <unk> that is literally a <unk>
And not only for that <unk>  but also for you and me.
Because if the water comes into the <unk> <unk>
A <unk> in the <unk> I know it,  but I <unk> it, and you should you do, because this <unk>  <unk> is also <unk>
You can say it is a <unk>  for the future of good <unk>  whether we're talking about <unk> or <unk>
So what we need to <unk>  is a new <unk> -- one in which the food actually good <unk>
But for a lot of people --  is that a little bit too <unk>
We are not <unk> we <unk>
We are <unk>
We love <unk>
We love <unk> <unk>
We talk about <unk> <unk>
We eat <unk>
And if you <unk> that these are the things --  which is the future of food <unk>  <unk> is always <unk>
How are you going to <unk> the world.
<unk> I <unk>
I don't like that question.
No, not because we are <unk> <unk> to <unk> the world.
One billion people leads today.
One billion -- that's more than ever <unk> --  because of the big <unk> in <unk>  not the <unk>
I don't love this question because she was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> of us from the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> to <unk>  <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>  and the whole <unk>  has <unk> <unk> <unk>  "If we <unk> <unk> more people <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> can <unk>
That's the <unk>
It's been the <unk>
It's been <unk>  of the American <unk>
We should call it what it is, we should be a <unk> in <unk>  a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> production <unk>
That's not a <unk>  and it's not <unk>
Our <unk> is now <unk> <unk>  not by <unk> <unk> <unk> but by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  not by the last <unk> and <unk> <unk>  but by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of water,  not by <unk> -- not by <unk> but by <unk>  not by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but by fish in the <unk>
Do you <unk> the world <unk>
Let's start with the question of how are we going to <unk>
Or <unk> how can we create <unk>  <unk> where any community can <unk>
To do that,  don't look at the <unk> for the future.
It's old and it's <unk>
It <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> and <unk>  and it has never really <unk> to eat <unk>
Let's look at the <unk> <unk>
That's the model that <unk> in two billion years  <unk> <unk>
Look at <unk>  <unk> as a <unk>  <unk> who are not own <unk>  <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk>  <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk> <unk>  instead of only <unk>  <unk> who are not <unk> but <unk> in <unk>  <unk> who are the ones that are the <unk> in <unk>
And if I'm very <unk>  they're a better <unk> than I will be ever <unk>
You know, I think it's <unk>  because if that the future of <unk> is <unk>
Thank you.
I <unk> on a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the <unk> <unk> I went to school with the <unk> to school, an hour and <unk> every day.
And I was always <unk> by a <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> me into <unk> <unk> to other <unk>  and that, in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And, you know, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the fact that I was <unk> when I was not at school  I was in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and they <unk> under the <unk>
You know, I was a real <unk>
But it was all about understanding the world,  the <unk> of <unk>
And <unk> love for <unk> <unk>  seemed to be <unk> in the world to <unk>  because what was <unk> this was the end of the <unk> <unk>  We went to go to the <unk>  we went to the <unk> <unk> -- we went to the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> that was the end of a world  And we had never <unk> us --
This seemed to <unk>  with the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> of it.
And I was a <unk>
I could <unk> I could <unk>
And because there were no <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all these pictures in the <unk>  I had to create these pictures in <unk>
You know, we had to read <unk> as children  a book and based on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>  something on the <unk> in our <unk>
And my <unk> was, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all these kinds of things.
I was <unk> <unk> during <unk> <unk> <unk>
That was the <unk>  that had to find a <unk>
And there was something <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  made me very <unk> about the fact that there was a <unk> world was just here on Earth.
I would not really go to a <unk> world  on a day in a <unk>
That was pretty <unk>
But that was a world that I could actually go to <unk>  <unk> who was so rich and <unk> <unk>  if everything I had <unk> by reading the <unk> of that <unk>
So I decided to be <unk>  at 15 <unk> <unk>
And the only problem with that I was in a small <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
But I didn't let me through that.
I was <unk> at <unk> until he finally did a <unk> in <unk> New <unk>  just about the <unk> of <unk> where we <unk>
And I <unk> <unk>  in a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in the middle of the <unk>  in <unk> New <unk>
And I saw the <unk> a real <unk> not  until two years later, when we went to <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>  40 years, I have about <unk> hours under water <unk> and 500 hours of that was in <unk>
And I learned that those <unk> <unk>  and even the <unk> <unk>  and even the <unk> <unk> are so rich with <unk> life --
The <unk> of nature is so <unk>  compared to our <unk> human <unk>
So to this day, I have <unk> <unk>  for what I see during this <unk>
And <unk> <unk> love for the ocean  is just as strong as she was <unk>
But when I was a <unk> <unk>  was this <unk>
And that seemed to be the best way to tell the <unk> that I had  to tell <unk>  with my <unk> to create <unk>
And as a child I was always doing the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> make the way of <unk> and stories --  <unk> to make <unk>
And of course, the <unk> that I <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And with <unk> <unk> I spent love  for <unk> and <unk> with <unk>
<unk> <unk> the two <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> in the first <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  who had ever <unk> in a <unk>
And even even though the movie the <unk> was <unk> <unk> I was <unk> <unk> I was <unk> to say,  I was <unk> of something that was the <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>  by this <unk> <unk>
You know, it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that every <unk> enough technology is not too <unk> technology is <unk>
They saw something <unk>
And I was very excited about that.
and I thought, <unk> this is something that <unk> should be <unk>  in the <unk>
So, with <unk> <unk> which was my second <unk>  we were going to go back here.
<unk> with <unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  in that <unk> It success <unk> of <unk>  or that would be <unk>
And we did that. And we <unk> again.
And we had the same <unk> with the <unk>
Al <unk> we <unk> a little more money on that <unk>
So, to <unk> a line between those two <unk> of <unk>  a whole new world, has been <unk> this is a whole new world,  a whole new world of <unk>  a whole new world of <unk>
So I started a company with <unk> <unk>  my good friend <unk> <unk> <unk>  who was the <unk> <unk> and <unk>  in that time and it was <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the concept of the company was that we would make a <unk> beyond  the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and we would <unk> to be <unk> <unk>
And we actually did that, and it gave us a <unk> <unk>
But we found our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the middle of the <unk> and <unk> <unk>  which we had <unk> <unk>
So I wrote this piece of <unk> <unk>  that was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>  of visual <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  with <unk> human <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>  And the <unk> would all be in <unk>  And the <unk> would be in his <unk>  And the world would be <unk>
And I was told by the people in <unk> <unk>  that we wouldn't be able to do this.
So I put it in the <unk> and I made that other film about a big <unk> that <unk>
I sold it to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk>
It becomes a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I wanted to do was to go to the real <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that's why I <unk> the <unk>
And that's the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But I said, <unk> I said, <unk> go to the <unk> <unk> We really go to the <unk> <unk>
We will use it in the <unk> of the <unk>
It's going to be very <unk> It's going to be a <unk> <unk>
And one I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> But this comes back to the <unk> of <unk>  you're <unk> that <unk> <unk>
Because we actually <unk> a reality of me six months later in a <unk> <unk> <unk>  two and a half <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the real <unk> <unk> <unk> to the real <unk> by a <unk> <unk> not a <unk> but <unk>
And I was <unk> <unk>
And it <unk> a lot of <unk> we had to develop <unk>  and <unk> and <unk> and all kinds of things.
But it <unk> me on how much  this <unk> this deep <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, you know, it was very <unk>  and the <unk> huge <unk>
You <unk> in this <unk> you <unk> in this dark <unk>  <unk> <unk> where there is no hope on <unk>  if you can't come back to <unk>
And I thought, <unk> it looks like I was in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is very <unk>
And so, I had to <unk> the <unk> of the deep ocean <unk>
<unk> the <unk> the <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk>  It was <unk> It was <unk> and it was a experience that  And it was a experience that  <unk> didn't <unk> me.
<unk> you know, I could tell me a <unk> and we could have a <unk> <unk> for <unk> But I couldn't <unk> what I saw  from that <unk>
<unk> we saw some of our next <unk>  I saw <unk> at <unk>  and sometimes I had never seen <unk>  and sometimes I had never seen  and sometimes I had never seen  who had not been <unk> by the <unk> at the time we saw them and they <unk>
So I was <unk> <unk> <unk>  I had to do more.
And so I made a very strange <unk>
And after the success of <unk>  I said, <unk> I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so we started <unk> this  <unk> <unk>
And we finally went to the <unk>  and <unk> it with <unk> <unk>
We went back to the <unk> of the <unk>
We took small <unk> that we had <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the idea was to go in and a <unk>  research of doing that <unk> which had never done before.
No one had ever <unk> in the <unk> <unk> They didn't have the tools to do it.  So we developed technology to do it.
So, here I'm now on the <unk> <unk>  of the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk>  and look at <unk> that many look at <unk> who seem like <unk> where I knew the <unk> <unk>
And I <unk> a little <unk>  by the <unk> of the <unk>
When I say I <unk> him <unk>  but <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  I felt like I was <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
And it was the most <unk> species that I had ever <unk>  because I had ever <unk> a <unk> to me --  what would be <unk> for the <unk>  of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  because I had <unk> on the <unk> <unk>  when we <unk> the <unk>
And the <unk> was like a <unk> <unk>  on the <unk> of <unk>
So it was an absolutely <unk> <unk>
And it was doing me that  the <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can have <unk> these kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk>  in this other form of <unk>
It was really pretty <unk>
And maybe a little bit of a <unk> <unk> to what <unk> <unk> <unk>  as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that I can imagine <unk> <unk> or other <unk>  that I can imagine a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, this <unk> was done to have  and really begin to <unk> what was going down there,  like the <unk> <unk> where we had these <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> just on Earth.
They live in a environment of <unk>
They don't live in a <unk>  based like we do that.
And so you can see animals that live next to <unk>  <unk> <unk>
You could think they could be <unk>
At the same time,  I was also very interested in <unk>  again, again, again, the <unk> <unk> influence as <unk>
And I got involved in  the <unk> -- very involved in <unk>  <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>  I went to <unk> I went to <unk> I went to <unk> <unk>  I went to <unk> to actually <unk> <unk>  with our <unk> camera <unk>
And this was <unk>
But what the <unk> was the <unk> that I <unk> space <unk> to us to the <unk>
And they were <unk> so they had access to  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  people who are interested in that <unk> <unk>  they <unk> down to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, here we were <unk> <unk> to make <unk>  but we actually have science on the  and actually <unk> <unk>
I was made the <unk> of <unk>  you know, from the <unk> <unk> <unk>  you know, as a child and all of this.
And you know, for this <unk>  of <unk> I learned a <unk>
I learned a lot about <unk> But I also learned a lot of  about <unk>
Now you would think that a <unk> should be a <unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk> and those kinds of <unk>
I didn't really learn about <unk>  until I <unk> those <unk>
Because I had to tell you a particular <unk>  "What do I <unk>
Why am I doing <unk> What do I <unk>
We <unk> no money with these <unk> <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> There is no <unk> to <unk>
And people think more or more that I <unk> is between <unk> and <unk> and I was <unk> to the <unk>  somewhere on the <unk>
I made all of these <unk> all of these <unk>  for a very <unk> <unk>
No <unk> no <unk> no money. Where are you <unk>
You do it for the work <unk>  for the <unk> and the ocean is the most <unk> environment that is there  for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and for those strange <unk> <unk> that <unk>  as a a small group of people <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we've been doing all these things with <unk> people --  <unk> for years.
<unk> on the sea for <unk> months of a <unk>
And by that <unk> you <unk>  that you <unk> the most important thing is that you have for them, and that you would have a <unk> <unk>  that you have a <unk> <unk>  which you can't <unk> to <unk>
When you go back to <unk> and you say, "We had to do this, and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk>  and the <unk> of it and <unk>  all of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk>  that you can <unk> not <unk>
That <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk>
So when I came back to <unk> <unk> <unk>  which was <unk> I was trying to <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is that your team <unk> your team <unk> and you <unk> in their <unk> <unk>
And that really changed the <unk>
So, I was again with a little <unk> <unk>  in the map of <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> to make the new technology <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And we were <unk> for a period of four and a half years.
And it <unk> how I <unk> <unk>
So, people gave <unk> on how to say, <unk>  the ocean was <unk> with  and they <unk> on the planet <unk>
For me, it was more a fundamental way of things --  the <unk> <unk> that as a result of it.
So, what can we from all of this <unk>
You know, what are the <unk> <unk>
Well, I think number is a <unk> <unk>
It's the <unk> which you <unk>
<unk> is a <unk>  that can <unk> a reality <unk>
And the <unk> of your team is <unk> than all the <unk>  in the world.
There are young <unk>  who come to me and say, <unk> me some <unk> to do <unk>
And I said, <unk> yourself no <unk>
<unk> people will do that for you, you do it <unk>  <unk> not against <unk>
And take <unk>
<unk> has this <unk> where she <unk> <unk> is not a <unk>
But <unk> needs to be a <unk>  in art and <unk> because it's a <unk> in the <unk>
And not a single important <unk>  that innovation has been done without <unk>
You have to be willing to take those <unk>
And that is the thought that I would want to <unk> you that in what you do,  <unk> a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> Thank you.
If I can <unk> you can <unk> one of the <unk> <unk>  is that it <unk> of the data of the data that we use is bigger than the <unk> of the <unk>
And instead of thinking about <unk> information --  I want to think about how  we can use information to <unk> <unk>  and <unk> that would <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
The <unk> I use is a <unk> <unk>
It's called <unk> With <unk> I can <unk>  <unk> on one particular <unk> for example, <unk>
I see <unk> another <unk>
And that's because in the middle of the  people are the most <unk> <unk> and it <unk>
We can go back to <unk>  and the data <unk> <unk>
We see that <unk> and <unk> and cancer <unk>  the <unk> are <unk> but not for <unk>
If we go <unk> and at age <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>  than we see that <unk>  the greatest <unk> of <unk>
If you look at that <unk> in <unk> that especially for <unk>
You see what I <unk>  in this way of information is looking at <unk>  in a living <unk>
If we can do this with <unk> <unk>  why not <unk>
What we have here --  is the <unk> of any number of <unk> <unk>  that's ever <unk>
It's all over here. It's on the <unk>
You can go to your <unk> and try this after my <unk>
With <unk> you can <unk> on a <unk> <unk>
You can <unk> in a <unk>
You can go to a particular number of <unk>
I <unk> this <unk> I see the <unk>  who are <unk> in this <unk> the <unk>
I am <unk> of <unk> <unk> so <unk> I <unk> up, and it <unk> me all the <unk>  where <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And if I just want to look <unk>  I think, "Why don't do all the <unk> <unk>
I do a step back and <unk>
Now I see <unk> <unk>
You see that if you <unk> this way through information <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  <unk> you don't <unk> you <unk>
You do something a little bit <unk>
It's <unk> and we think it's <unk> how you can use information.
So I want to <unk> it a little bit more <unk>
Here we have taken every page of <unk>  and she <unk> to a little <unk>
The <unk> is made of a little <unk> and a <unk> to give the <unk> <unk>
I'll just show you the top 500 <unk>  <unk> <unk>
But even in this <unk> <unk>  we can do a lot of <unk>
We get <unk> a idea of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I go beyond and <unk> <unk>
Now, I have government <unk>  I see that the <unk>  I see that the <unk> <unk>  <unk> People are <unk> of the <unk>
This is very important because this understanding of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can only get it through a step <unk> and look at it.
If I look at one of these <unk>  can I <unk> on the understanding of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> of the year -- by showing them all <unk>
A <unk> on all of these people --  <unk> <unk> me that the <unk>
Some come from the <unk>
And another <unk> comes from the <unk>
That's my <unk>
<unk> comes from the <unk>
What's interesting is that <unk>  is that <unk> is also a TED <unk>
So we can <unk> to all the TED <unk>
So we <unk> for the first time by the web  as if it really is not from page to page  but on a higher <unk>
I want to show you one other thing --  that you will <unk>
I'll show you the <unk> of the New York <unk>
<unk> this <unk> --  I don't want to <unk> it is not a <unk>  but you can look at it --  We bring this <unk> technology to every <unk>
I'm going to take a <unk>  and <unk> <unk> right in a particular <unk>
The reason this is this important is that I just <unk> to look at <unk>  I can look at the same time.
I can go and look at what I did in some <unk>
Here's the <unk>  of the <unk> I just <unk>
I can <unk> some of the things that I <unk> to <unk>
If I <unk> a step <unk> and I can <unk> my <unk>  maybe on my <unk>
And here I did some <unk> <unk>  I <unk> <unk> and here <unk> <unk> <unk>
And from that I can <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> them again.
It's one <unk> which is more than the <unk> <unk> and every time, and every time <unk> it <unk> the <unk> of the parts of the <unk>
<unk> in our world,  we see data as a <unk>
We talk about the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
We talked about <unk> in <unk>
If we could <unk> that <unk> on his <unk>  and the <unk> on his <unk>  so that instead of going to go from one thing to the <unk>  we <unk> that we can <unk> from many things to <unk>  <unk> we can see from <unk>  that we can see from <unk>  that would be <unk>
If we <unk> that <unk> we can't be <unk> in <unk>  than we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> of only working with information --  we might be able to <unk> <unk>
If we have knowledge to <unk> there is maybe even <unk>
<unk> thank you very much.
Everybody is talking about <unk>
I have somebody <unk> the number of books --  that the <unk> was five years <unk> with <unk> in the <unk>  and he <unk> it <unk> after about <unk> and there were a lot more.
There's a lot of <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of <unk>
<unk> would like to make people <unk>
But <unk> those <unk> work  there are different <unk> <unk> <unk>  that are kind of impossible to think about <unk>  about <unk>
And I'm going to talk today about that <unk> <unk>
This is true for ordinary people who are <unk> about their own <unk> and it is true for <unk> that <unk> <unk>  because it turns out that we are as all <unk>
The first <unk>  is the <unk> to give <unk> <unk>
It turns out that the word happiness is just not a <unk> word because we <unk> it in too many things.
I think there is one certain meaning that we could <unk> it <unk>  but everything is <unk>  is something that we should <unk>  and we're going to <unk> the more <unk> vision of what is <unk>
The second <unk> is the <unk> between experience and <unk>  which is <unk> on the difference between his life and <unk> his happy about your life  and happy about your life.
And those are two totally different things that are <unk> in one hope in the concept of <unk>
And the third <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>  and the <unk> fact that we can't think of a <unk>  that has impact on our <unk> <unk>
I mean, this is a really <unk> <unk>
There's no way to get this right now.
Now, I would like to start with an example of someone who during a <unk> and <unk>  after one of my <unk> a story.
And this was the story.
He said that he had listen to a <unk>  and it was absolutely amazing music was at the end of the <unk>  and at the end of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then he said, really <unk> that this whole experience had <unk>
But it <unk>
It had the <unk> to the experience <unk>
He had the <unk>
He had 20 minutes great music <unk>
They were not worth <unk>  because he <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> was <unk>  and the <unk> had been <unk>
So what this <unk>  is that we could see ourselves and others as two <unk>
There is a <unk> I think,  who live in the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is <unk> in <unk> the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> to our <unk> I --  you know, if the <unk> <unk>  You know, if I ask you <unk>
And then the <unk> I <unk>  and the <unk> I <unk> that <unk> the state of <unk>  and the story of our life <unk>  and that's the person to <unk> <unk>  and that's the person to <unk>  how do you did you have the last time.
or "How was your journey to <unk> or <unk>
And these are two very different things,  the <unk> I and the <unk> between both is part of the <unk> of the <unk>  that is made of the understanding of the understanding of <unk>
The <unk> I <unk>  is a <unk>
And that really starts with a fundamental <unk> of our <unk> --  It starts <unk>
We don't only tell stories when we <unk> us to tell <unk>
Our <unk> tells us <unk>  I want to say what we can <unk> of our <unk>  is a story.
And let me start with one example.
This is an old <unk>
Those are real patients that <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> you the <unk> This is not <unk> <unk>  but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the <unk>
They had to do 60 <unk> about their <unk>
And these are two <unk>
These are their <unk>
And there are asked of them to have the <unk> <unk>
And that's a very <unk> question.
It's clear that patient <unk> <unk> has been <unk>
His <unk> has <unk> <unk>  and for every <unk> pain that patient <unk> has <unk>  patient <unk> and more.
But here's another <unk>  How many pain think they <unk>
And what a <unk>  The <unk> is that patient <unk>  a lot of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The stories of the <unk> <unk>  because a very important part of the story is --  and not one of these stories is very <unk> or <unk> --  but one of them is <unk>  but one of them is more <unk> than the other.
And the <unk> story is the story in which the pain of <unk>
That's a <unk> story.
How do we know that?  Because we <unk> these people after their <unk> <unk> and a lot of later,  "How was was very the whole <unk> everything in <unk>
and it was much more <unk> for <unk> than <unk> in their <unk>
Well, this is a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> I <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, what you might do with patient <unk>  and we actually <unk> <unk>  and that's <unk> and it <unk>  you could <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk>  by the <unk> just <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
That makes the patient <unk> <unk> but not <unk>  and much less than <unk>
And if you <unk> a couple of minutes --  You have <unk> it for the <unk> I <unk>  and you <unk> it for the <unk> I <unk> <unk>   <unk> a lot of it for the <unk> I <unk> a better given a story  because you have a better story about his <unk>
What <unk> a <unk>
And that's where for the stories  that <unk> <unk> us -- and it's <unk> for the stories that we <unk>
What a story <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> are very important and in this case it was the end of the <unk>
Well, I <unk>  Well, I live his life <unk>
It has <unk> of <unk> one after another.
And you <unk> what happens to this <unk>
And the answer is really <unk>
They're always <unk>
I mean, most <unk> of our lives --  I have the <unk> -- you know, the <unk> <unk> <unk>  takes about three <unk> says <unk>
That <unk> you know,  in a life, you have about <unk> million <unk>
In a <unk> there are about <unk>
Most of them don't have <unk> <unk>
On the most of the <unk> is <unk> not attention  by the <unk>
And yet, you get in some other way that they should be <unk>  that they should be of <unk>  which is what happens to this <unk>  our lives.
It's the <unk> <unk> we are <unk>
And how you look like how to be <unk> <unk>  but so the story is not the <unk> I <unk> for us.
So we have the <unk> I  and the <unk> I <unk> and the <unk> are really <unk>
Most of the difference between both is in the <unk> with time.
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> I have a <unk> <unk> and is the second week as good as the first  then the <unk> of two weeks as well as the <unk> of one <unk>
So it doesn't work.
For the <unk> I'm a <unk> of two weeks --  <unk> better than the <unk> of one week because there are no new <unk>
You didn't changed the story.
And in that way,  time is actually the <unk> <unk>  I <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> has very little impact on this story.
The <unk> I <unk> more than <unk> <unk> and tell <unk>
It's the person who <unk> <unk>  <unk> if you have a patient <unk> you know,  two <unk> in two different <unk> and <unk> has to <unk> what he <unk>  <unk> for <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and that's the <unk> he will <unk>
The <unk> I have no <unk> in this <unk>
We don't choose <unk>
We choose between <unk> to <unk>  And even if we think about the future  we normally think of our future.
We think of our future  as a <unk> <unk>
And you can actually <unk> this as a <unk> of the <unk> I <unk>  and I can <unk> it as a <unk> I <unk>  <unk> that <unk> I <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk>  I don't need it to <unk>  And I <unk> it is, if we're going to be <unk>  And the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
And that's pretty difficult to <unk> I think.
I mean, how often do we use our <unk>
That's one of the <unk>  which is given for the <unk> <unk>
And if I <unk> <unk> I think about a <unk>  that we had a few years ago in <unk>  who was <unk> our best <unk> was ever <unk>  and I think about it.  in <unk> with other <unk>
And I probably have my <unk> to that <unk> <unk> of three weeks for about 25 minutes over the last four <unk>
Now, if I had ever <unk> the <unk>  with the <unk> <unk> <unk>  I would have an <unk> <unk> <unk>
So these are three weeks and that's almost <unk>
There seems to be a <unk>
Now, maybe I am a little <unk> you know,  in the <unk> <unk> that I have to use <unk> but even if you do that <unk> <unk>   is the <unk>  why do we <unk> so much <unk> to <unk>  <unk> we <unk> so much <unk> to the <unk> that we <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I want you to <unk>  about a <unk>
So imagine that in your next <unk>  <unk> you know that at the end of the <unk>  and you get a <unk> <unk> and you get a <unk> that you <unk> <unk>  so you won't be <unk>
<unk> you have the same <unk> <unk>  And if you <unk> a different <unk> there is a <unk> between your two <unk>
and you need to think about how to <unk> that <unk>
That is not so <unk> because if you think in terms of time  you think of time -- you get one <unk>
And if you think in terms of <unk>  you might get another <unk>
Why do we choose the <unk> that we <unk>  is a question that <unk> us  with a choice between the two <unk>
Now, the two <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are really two <unk> of happiness --  that we can <unk> one per <unk>
So you can <unk> how happy is the <unk> <unk>
And then you <unk> how happy are the <unk> <unk>  in life of the <unk> <unk>
And it's all -- the happiness of <unk>  is a pretty <unk> <unk>
What are the <unk> that can be <unk>
<unk> today, we are able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> I <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> I <unk> through the time.
If you ask the <unk> of the <unk> I <unk>  is that a totally different <unk>
This is not about how happy somebody <unk>
It's about how <unk> or <unk> the person is the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Everybody who <unk> this <unk> in a lot of <unk>  is going to make the study of the <unk> <unk>  and I <unk> to a group of the <unk>  who have made a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of happiness --  <unk> this way.
The <unk> between the  happiness of the <unk> I  and the <unk> of the <unk> I was <unk> <unk>  and now now <unk> to <unk> the two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a global <unk> -- where more than a half a million people are    <unk> about what they think about their life.
And there are still more <unk> in the sense of <unk>
So the <unk> of the <unk> we begin to <unk>  in the happiness of the two <unk>
And the most important <unk> we <unk> I think,  is that they really <unk> each other.
You can know how <unk> somebody with his life is  and <unk> you learn that really <unk>  about how happy he <unk> his life <unk>  and <unk>
<unk> to give you an idea of the <unk>  the <unk> is about <unk>
That means that if you would <unk> somebody <unk>  and you would say his <unk> is a <unk> <unk>  how much would you know about his <unk>
You would think about his <unk>  but there's a lot of <unk>
<unk> <unk> you would have <unk>  if I tell you that somebody has <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk>  you've got a lot of <unk>  you've got a lot of <unk>  -- about their <unk>
So the <unk> is <unk>
We know something about what the <unk> of the <unk> I <unk>
We know that money is very important.
We know that happiness means happiness means that we are <unk> with people that we <unk>  by <unk> time with people we <unk>
There are other <unk> but this <unk>
So if you want to <unk> the <unk> of the two <unk> <unk> it will <unk> that you  very different things.
The <unk> of what I said here is that we should not be <unk>  as a <unk> for <unk>
It's a completely <unk> <unk>
And now now very quickly --  another reason we can't think about happiness --  is that we can't think about happiness --  if we think about life <unk> and as we live <unk>
So if you ask the simple question of how <unk> people in <unk>  you'll not get the right <unk>
If you ask that <unk>  Do you think people should be <unk> in <unk>  if you're <unk> in <unk> <unk>
And what happens is  if you think of life in <unk>  <unk> you think about the <unk>  between <unk> and other places  and that <unk> is <unk> than for example, in the <unk>
It turns out that it's <unk>  not so important for the <unk> I  and even not for the <unk> I  that <unk> how happy people are.
But because it <unk> I <unk> the <unk>  can it <unk> that you -- that some people have to go to <unk> <unk>
And it's interesting to <unk> what is going to happen to people who are going to be <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Well, their <unk> itself will not be <unk>
We know that.
But one thing happens. They think they are <unk> <unk> because if they think about it, they will think about it, they're going to <unk> how <unk> it was in <unk>
And they will think that they made the right <unk>
It's very difficult to think about <unk>  and I hope I hope I have given you an idea of how <unk> it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for <unk>
Thank you very much.
When we <unk> a couple of weeks ago to me that there was a very interesting <unk>  from that <unk>
Can you share this with us  <unk> you have a few minutes about <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It has to do with the <unk>  of the <unk>
If we look at how <unk>  differences <unk> it <unk>
It turns out that under the <unk>  of <unk> dollars a year, for <unk>  and it's about a very large group of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> under the <unk> per <unk>
CA: <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> a year, people are <unk>  and they become <unk> <unk>
<unk> we see a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, I've seen <unk> such a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> what happens  is that money doesn't make a <unk>  but you don't have a <unk> of money <unk> you can <unk> <unk>  and we can measure that <unk>  with <unk> very large <unk>
For the other <unk> I <unk>  you get a very different story.
The more money you <unk> the more <unk> you <unk>
That's not <unk>
CA: But <unk> the entire American <unk> is <unk> on  life, <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
If people who are going to take <unk> <unk>  But what we do is, we <unk> <unk>  what we believe <unk>  <unk> <unk> policy and so on.
Is there a chance that <unk> that the country in <unk>  a <unk> <unk> would <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it would be <unk>
<unk> You know, I think there is <unk>  of the role of <unk> in the public <unk>
That <unk> will come up in the United States.  that <unk> no <unk> no <unk>  but in the <unk> <unk> this to the <unk>  and in other countries too.
People <unk> they should think about happiness --  if they think about <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's going to have a time <unk>  and people will <unk>  about the question of whether they want to study or the <unk> of life <unk>  So we'll have to <unk> that <unk> <unk>
How we <unk>  is all <unk> on how you think about how you think  and or your <unk> about the <unk> I <unk>
This will be the <unk> <unk> in the next <unk>
And in the United States are done in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I think that about a year or <unk>  part of the national <unk>
CA: Well, it seems that this <unk>  the <unk> <unk> to follow is <unk> or should be <unk>  for the next few <unk>
Thank you very much for your <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk today about energy and <unk>
And that might seem a little <unk> because my <unk> work at the <unk> especially is about <unk> and <unk>  of the things we need to <unk> and <unk>  to help the <unk> two billion people.
But energy and <unk> are important for these people,  in fact, <unk> for <unk> who are on this planet.
The <unk> <unk> so their <unk> will not <unk>
There will be too much <unk> or <unk>
<unk> will change so  their <unk> <unk> is just not <unk>
And that leads to <unk> It leads to <unk> It leads to <unk>
So the <unk> will be a <unk> for them.
The price of energy is <unk> important for <unk>
In <unk> if you could only choose one thing to <unk> <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> you would <unk> energy <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is based on the <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> led to the industrial <unk>  and even in the <unk> century, there was a very quick <unk> for <unk>  and so we have <unk> <unk>  can we make modern materials and so much of things.
And so we have a beautiful situation with electricity in the rich world.
<unk> now we make it <unk> -- and let's make it twice as <unk> --  -- there is a new <unk> <unk> and it has to do it with <unk>
leads to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  and <unk> the <unk> of CO2 is actually a very <unk>
If you <unk> the CO2 that is <unk> <unk>  which leads to a <unk>  which leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> of the back of the back of the <unk> <unk>  that the natural <unk> can't <unk> <unk> on this <unk> <unk>  and so you get <unk> that <unk>
Now, the amount of of how you  from a certain <unk> of CO2 to what <unk> will go to  and where the positive <unk> is only <unk> but not very <unk>
And there is certainly <unk> about how very <unk> will be very <unk> but they're going to be very <unk>
I often asked this to <unk>
We need to really <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> we don't <unk> half or a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is that, until we get into the <unk> <unk>  the <unk> will keep <unk>
And so that's a big <unk>
It's very different than a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> under a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is something called <unk>
Now, we <unk> <unk> much CO2 --  more than <unk> <unk> billion <unk>
For every <unk> this is about 20 <unk>
For people in poor countries it's less than one <unk>
It's an average of about five <unk> for everybody on the planet.
And we also also also change things --  to <unk> that <unk>
It's <unk> up <unk>
<unk> what economic changes do it <unk>  so we need to <unk> a quick <unk> to a <unk> and from a <unk> <unk> to <unk>
This <unk> has four <unk>
a little <unk>
So, you have something about the <unk> <unk> that you want to bring to <unk>  and that's based on the number of people,  the average use of <unk> per <unk> of <unk> <unk> per <unk>
So, let's look at this piece of <unk>  and see how we can get this to <unk>
<unk> needs to be one of these values in the <unk> of <unk>
That's high school <unk>  but let's take a <unk> <unk>
<unk> we have the <unk>
Now, the world has been <unk> billion people.
That's the <unk> to about nine <unk>
So, if we really do it with new <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  than we could <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 or 15 <unk> but we see a <unk> of about <unk>
The second <unk> is the <unk> that we use of <unk>
This <unk> <unk>  the food that we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And these are very good things,  and the <unk> of poverty means the <unk> of this <unk>  to almost everybody on the planet.
So it's great like this <unk> <unk>
In the rich world, maybe the top <unk> one <unk>  can we probably <unk> and the <unk> <unk>  but <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And so, in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> per person more than <unk>
Here's a very simple <unk>
<unk> you <unk> in your house to <unk> your <unk>  fact is, these kids are not going to go out and read their <unk> under the <unk>
So, <unk> <unk> the energy for every <unk>
<unk> we have good <unk>
We have something that is not <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and new ways of <unk>  through other kinds of <unk> other <unk>
There are a lot of <unk> where you can be <unk>
Some individual <unk> even with 90 percent.
There are other <unk> like how we <unk> <unk>  or how we <unk> with <unk> <unk>  where space is space for <unk> much <unk>
And so, if we are <unk>  we can have a <unk> three to <unk> <unk> a <unk> six <unk>
But for this first three <unk>  we're from <unk> billion <unk> on his <unk> <unk> billion <unk> and that's just not <unk>
So let's look at this <unk> <unk> <unk> --  this will be a <unk> --  and that's the CO2 <unk> <unk> per <unk>
So the question is, can you go to <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> every way that we <unk> <unk> today -- except the <unk> sustainable energy and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so we need to do a global <unk>  is a new system.
So we need <unk>
So, if I <unk> the <unk> <unk> I don't think it's <unk>
The <unk> is a <unk> The <unk> is a <unk>
The Internet and his <unk> are a <unk> <unk>
So, the people have <unk> here are creating many <unk>
<unk> we have no <unk>  when you have to have a certain <unk>
<unk> <unk> you just <unk> and sometimes it <unk>
This is a thing that we should be <unk> at <unk> speed and a <unk> <unk>
Now, I thought, how can I really <unk>
Is there a kind of natural <unk>  a <unk> that <unk> in people until the <unk> <unk>
I was thinking about a year ago when I was <unk> <unk> and I was <unk> and in some way it was <unk>
It was really involved in the idea --  that there are people who live with <unk>
So, with <unk> this was the only thing that I could <unk>
I decided to <unk>  as my <unk> to the environment here is this year.
So here we have some natural <unk>
<unk> was told that they're not <unk> <unk> they <unk> maybe not even <unk> this <unk>
So, there are all kinds of <unk> <unk> like that, but they don't really <unk>
We need <unk> a or <unk> <unk>  I think of an incredible <unk> and of an incredible <unk>  And although people in many <unk> <unk> <unk>  I see it actually five that <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it might be able to <unk>  and if they're doing it better than I <unk> is to <unk> that <unk>  but my most important point here is that we're going to work on every one of these five and we can't have one because it's so <unk> so <unk> because it's so <unk> <unk>  they all have their own <unk>
Let's look at <unk>  or <unk> of <unk> or <unk> of <unk>
What you need to do it <unk> but it's not.
You have to <unk> all of CO2 after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on <unk>  and hope it <unk> there.
Now there are a number of <unk> that are doing this at the level of 60 to 80 percent percent of the <unk> is going to be very <unk>  and <unk> where we have to do all that CO2 is very <unk>  but the <unk> of this is <unk>
Who is this <unk>
Who will be <unk> for something that is literally billions of <unk> more than what kind of <unk> you can think in terms of <unk> or other <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
So that's <unk>
The next is <unk> <unk>
And there is three big <unk>
The <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>
The question of the <unk> really <unk> that nothing can be <unk>  <unk> even though you have this human <unk>  that the <unk> can't be used for <unk>
And what you do with the <unk>
And, even though it's not so much more <unk>
<unk> needs to have a good sense of <unk>
So three very difficult problems that might be <unk>  and <unk> should be <unk>
The last three of the <unk> I <unk>
These are what people often call the <unk> <unk>
And that -- although it's great that they have no <unk> --  Some <unk>
One is that the <unk> of the energy <unk> by this <unk>  <unk> <unk> is <unk> that <unk>
This is <unk> you talk about many <unk> <unk>  thousands of <unk> more than you need for a normal <unk>
And these are <unk> <unk>
And the sun not <unk> the whole day, and not every day,  and, also <unk> it doesn't <unk> it.
And so, if you <unk> on this <unk>  you also have to find a way to have energy to have <unk>
So, we have great <unk> here.
We have <unk> <unk>
<unk> for example, these <unk> outside your country <unk>  You don't need to make the risk of technology -- but you've got to <unk> the risk of the energy of <unk>
And, <unk> the <unk> problem.
And to make that <unk> I've been <unk> to <unk> all kinds of <unk> that made <unk>  for <unk> for <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and what I found is that all the <unk> that we <unk>  than 10 minutes of all of all of the energy <unk>
So we need a big <unk> <unk>  something that is a <unk> hundred more than the way we have now.
It's not <unk> but it's not <unk>
This is <unk> important if you're trying to get that <unk>  higher <unk> than 20 to 30 percent of what you <unk>
If you look at it for <unk>  you need a <unk> <unk>
Now, how do we <unk> <unk> what is the right <unk>
Is it a <unk> How can we do this?
Well, we need a lot of companies that are working on it.
In each one of these five <unk> at least a hundred people.
And a lot of <unk> you will <unk> <unk> That's good.
And I think that's in the <unk>  we have a lot of people who have this already <unk>
Bill <unk> has different <unk> <unk> <unk> a named <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies  And these amazing things are doing and interesting <unk>  and I'm trying to <unk> it.
<unk> <unk> and I <unk> a company  <unk> maybe <unk> <unk>
There are a number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And there is no innovation in this <unk>  so it's not so <unk> that there are good new ideas.
And the idea of <unk> is that, instead of just a little bit of <unk> <unk>  one <unk> <unk> <unk> we decided to use the <unk> <unk>
A little <unk> <unk>
<unk> has ever been talking about <unk>  but they could never <unk> or it would work.
But by the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  that is <unk> and <unk>
And with the right materials that is probably going to work.
And because you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can actually use the <unk> and as a <unk> you can use all the <unk> <unk> of current <unk>
So instead of <unk> <unk> that new <unk> which is <unk>
It uses this <unk> during the <unk> It looks like a <unk>
You see in this <unk> <unk> it's called a <unk> <unk>
For the <unk> this is really <unk> <unk>
I have a picture of a place here in <unk>
This is <unk> the <unk> <unk>  where the <unk> is <unk>
So it's called <unk> <unk>
That's enough for the United States for hundreds of <unk>
And in a cheap way of <unk> <unk>  <unk> you get enough for the <unk> of the entire planet.
So, there's a lot of challenges for the <unk>  but it's an example of many hundreds of and hundreds of ideas we need to go <unk>
So we thought, how do we measure <unk>
What should we <unk> out of <unk>
Let's see where we should <unk>  and then look at the <unk>
For <unk> a lot of people talk about <unk> <unk>
And it's really important to get that <unk>
And that 20 percent will be used by poor countries, a <unk> <unk>
<unk> we have <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So, to get that <unk>  the developed countries, have <unk> countries like <unk>  their <unk> have <unk>
And the other <unk> <unk> we <unk> technology --  in all developed countries, and are we <unk> that <unk>
That's <unk>
That's a important <unk> for that <unk>
So, how to do it <unk> for <unk> <unk>
Well, it's got to those two <unk> <unk>
We need to <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
How do we <unk> how <unk> the CO2 is <unk>  and so, how <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But in some <unk> the <unk> that we <unk>  by doing things that <unk> not at all of us at the big <unk>  <unk> or maybe even something important than the <unk>  that's the piece of innovation on this <unk>
And this <unk> we need to <unk> on <unk> <unk>  and we can measure that in terms of <unk>  <unk> <unk> things that have <unk>
Here's a big number of beautiful books about <unk>
And the book of Al <unk> <unk> <unk>  and the book of David <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They <unk> it really good and <unk> a <unk>  that this can be in large <unk> because we need to get a <unk> <unk>
There is a lot of that we need to <unk>
So this is a <unk>
It's a very <unk> wish that we <unk> this <unk>
If you just gave me one wish for the next 50 years,  I could choose <unk> who was <unk>  I could choose a <unk> <unk> something that I could choose from <unk>  that is <unk> with half the <unk> of the <unk> without <unk> <unk>  This is the <unk> I would <unk>
This is the one with the biggest <unk>
If we don't get this <unk>  the <unk> between the people who think on the short <unk> and <unk> will be <unk> in the United States and <unk> between poor and rich countries,  between the United States.
So, what should we do?
So what am I going to <unk>
We need to do more <unk> of <unk>
If countries <unk> in places like <unk>  they don't have to talk about the <unk>
They need to <unk> this <unk>  and you'll be <unk> of the <unk> low <unk>  on these <unk> <unk>
We need <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  something that makes the cost <unk>
We need to <unk> the <unk>
This <unk> needs to be <unk> and <unk>  with <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the <unk>
This is an important <unk> but I think we can achieve it.

Chris Anderson: Thank you.
<unk> Now I understand more about <unk> <unk> --  I mean, the first <unk> can give you an idea of <unk> of the <unk>
Bill <unk> To do the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the big scientists do what we <unk>  which is only <unk> <unk> <unk> and even though we <unk> a time our materials in a <unk> <unk> <unk>  to make sure that our <unk> <unk>  <unk> is going to make sure that our <unk>  <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as soon as you have the first <unk> if this works like <unk>  But it's just <unk> because the <unk> the <unk> is so <unk> as we know it.
CA: And yeah, to understand it <unk> is about building deep <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  of this kind of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  of these <unk> <unk> <unk> and then the process starts to <unk>
<unk> That <unk> today, the <unk> has to be <unk>  so you've got a lot of people and a lot of the <unk> that can go wrong in and so on.
That's not good.
So, if you have a very cheap <unk> that you can <unk> 60 years --  think about it as a <unk> --  <unk> it up, and it <unk> and have no <unk> of those <unk>
And it's just done.
CA: It's a <unk> that <unk> his own <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, what happens to the <unk>  you can <unk> it -- there's a lot less <unk> with this <unk> --  or you can actually <unk> it <unk>  and <unk> it in a other and <unk> it there.
And we start with the <unk> that <unk> is <unk>  that's <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> in <unk>
That's our <unk> to start with.
So, what a problem from this <unk>  is actually what is <unk> in the <unk>  and you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is pretty <unk> by this <unk>
CA: But in your global <unk>  about this <unk> where is the most interested in order to really <unk>
<unk> Well, we have no place that is <unk>  and there are interesting <unk> about everything that <unk> <unk>  so we <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>  that people from the company in <unk> India, China have been <unk>
I have the <unk> of energy on this <unk>  to talk about how this <unk> in the <unk>
So I'm <unk> You know that the <unk> and the <unk> some work <unk>
This is a <unk> in something that has been done.
It's a very important <unk> but it's like a quick <unk> and a lot of countries have been <unk>  so everybody who has done a quick <unk> to build the first <unk>
CA: So, in your <unk> <unk> and <unk>  of something like this on the <unk>
<unk> Well, we need to do these <unk> <unk> <unk> things  that are very <unk>  we've been very <unk> 20 years to <unk>
That is a kind of <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> we need to <unk>
And you know, <unk> if everything <unk> is going to do a lot of people.
And now there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  we need hundreds of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> they can <unk> <unk>
And it's the best thing as there is <unk> <unk>  <unk> you can make a <unk> of these things.
We need <unk> one to <unk>
CA: In terms of possible changes in big <unk>  this is the biggest that you <unk>
<unk> A energy <unk> is the <unk>
That would be <unk> even without the <unk>  but the <unk> makes it so much <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> are also other <unk>
You know, we don't know their work as good as <unk>  but the <unk> people, that's another <unk>
There is a type of <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> but maybe they say about us.
So there are <unk>  but the beauty of this is a <unk>  has a million times as much energy as <unk> a <unk>  and <unk> if you can <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk>  who are <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>  which is the <unk> and <unk> the <unk>  in a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
CA: If this doesn't <unk> what <unk>
<unk> we start with the <unk> of <unk>  to try to <unk> the <unk> of the Earth <unk>
<unk> If you get in that <unk>  it's as if you have <unk> and at the point is to get a <unk>
Where do you go to <unk> You can have a <unk> or something like that.
There is a line of study that <unk> <unk>  that are different <unk> that would <unk> the <unk> <unk>  which we buy us 20 or 30 years to <unk> our <unk>
That's just a kind of <unk>
You <unk> you don't <unk>
Some people say you don't even have to work on such <unk>  because it you might make <unk>  that you <unk> because you know that there is a <unk> to save you.
I don't know if that <unk> is <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> but now is the <unk> <unk>  <unk> needs to <unk> that in the case faster <unk>  or if the innovation is going to <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> if you could tell one or two <unk> to them to say, how would you <unk> them <unk>
<unk> Well, <unk> the <unk> come from different <unk>
There are very little bit of scientific <unk>
<unk> they <unk> that there are <unk> <unk> <unk>  who have to do with the <unk> that these things are <unk>
There are <unk> very few things that they can <unk>  there's a chance of one in a million that <unk>
The important problem we have here is just something like this.
You make the wrong now, and you <unk> a lot later on.
And so, when you have all sorts of <unk> problems right now the pain of the pain to get the <unk> --  and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, the <unk> <unk> not <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and there are people in the rich world who <unk> of the <unk>  and say, <unk> that <unk> is a pretty <unk>
It should be <unk> that <unk> us <unk>
But my dream is that, if you can make it <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  it can't <unk> me that there is no CO2 CO2 <unk> -- I might even <unk> that there from <unk>  I might even <unk> that it is <unk>
CA: And that would be your response to the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  that actually if you <unk> all of this energy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of your other <unk>  to try to <unk> the world of <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> of <unk> to spend some money on it, if there are better things we can do with it.
<unk> Well, the <unk> <unk> for that <unk> <unk> --  say that the United States have to spend a year --  not so <unk>
It doesn't have to be <unk> in other things.
It's really <unk> in large <unk> and this can <unk> people from <unk> <unk> <unk>  when you <unk> is trying to <unk>
That is, I think it's a <unk>
<unk> you are very close to a solution and you only the <unk>  and it's very <unk>
And I think we should try and have more things that the <unk> to be much less <unk>
If it's <unk> that you start to make the energy <unk> <unk>  then can <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk>
I mean, all of us could pay five times as much for our energy without <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> is for those two <unk>
And even <unk> has <unk>
His <unk> is why is there not more about <unk> <unk>
He is still <unk> because of his <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> but he realized that a pretty <unk> <unk>  and so, he <unk> that is <unk>
And so there is a red <unk> that I think of <unk>
It's <unk> how little the <unk> <unk> is <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> I <unk> that I <unk> out of the name of most people here --  if I <unk> I really hope that your wish in <unk> <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.
<unk> Thank you.
<unk> <unk> with you something that I found a few months ago,  when I <unk> an <unk> for the <unk> <unk>
And I always <unk> the <unk> with hand if I was writing <unk>  but I was already <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  and I thought I had never <unk>  the word <unk>
I <unk> you <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> this to a <unk> and first <unk> because it was so <unk>  but <unk> after <unk> <unk> started to <unk> <unk> <unk>  but after <unk> <unk> <unk> and I had to <unk> myself to <unk>  because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> that these words <unk>
<unk> this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think, <unk> this is an old <unk> <unk>
But it was a pressure from the early <unk>  when I started about with the <unk> school --  and I started to develop a <unk> of myself outside of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the other children and the world around me.
I don't want to say that I didn't get a <unk> <unk>
And with this <unk> it as if I was born in a world --  where someone I was <unk>  if somebody where nothing to say about <unk>  while I <unk> is <unk> to say the <unk> and <unk>  that I <unk> in my life.
So I was going to look at the <unk> online <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> version of the <unk>
<unk> not much better.
I <unk> the last words under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's not just about <unk>
It's about our <unk> about people if we <unk> them with these <unk>
And the values behind the words and how we have those <unk>
And our language <unk> us and how we think the world and how we look at other people.
A lot of old <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>  <unk> that the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> was so powerful because if you say something <unk> it is <unk>
So what is <unk> we want to <unk>  a person who is <unk> or a person who is <unk>
If we do something <unk> as the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> a <unk>  then we <unk> them and <unk> a <unk> about their <unk>
<unk> we would not <unk> for <unk>
<unk> who <unk> for me was my <unk> when I was a child <unk>  to the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
It's called Dr. <unk>
<unk> <unk> name <unk>  <unk> was hard to <unk> <unk> so he <unk> Dr. <unk>
Dr. <unk> <unk> always very <unk> <unk>  and had exactly the good <unk> to work with children.
I was <unk> of almost everything in the time I was in that <unk>  with <unk> of the <unk>
I had to do a almost <unk> number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- different <unk> --  to build my <unk>
I <unk> that <unk> more than everything.
I <unk> she <unk> I <unk> them.
As a <unk> child <unk> I was <unk> with Dr. <unk> to get under that <unk>  without <unk> <unk>
And one day he came into a <unk> <unk> --  <unk> and <unk> who were <unk> --  <unk> and he said to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you're such a <unk> powerful <unk> I think you're going to <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> I'll give you a hundred <unk>
And of course, this was a <unk> <unk> of Dr. <unk> to <unk> me to do the <unk> that I didn't want to do the <unk> <unk> <unk> that I wanted to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>  but what he actually did for me that he was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I wonder in <unk> his vision --  and his <unk> that I was a very <unk> and powerful girl <unk>  my <unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> person in the future.
This is an example of how <unk> in <unk>  the power of a child can <unk>
But in the last <unk> of that <unk>  <unk> our <unk> our <unk> to the reality that we would like to <unk> <unk>  the possibility of <unk> <unk>
Our language is <unk> the changes in society  and a lot of those are <unk> by technology.
And with <unk> from <unk>  my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for old <unk>  <unk> <unk> that people do more <unk> with their <unk> <unk> to their <unk> through the nature of <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> but <unk> about social <unk>  so they can <unk> themselves with <unk> <unk> <unk>
So maybe technology shows us a lot of <unk>  something which is always a <unk>  that everybody has something <unk> and something <unk>  and our ability to <unk> us to <unk> our best <unk>
And the ability of human human <unk> is <unk> because everybody wants to talk to me about the <unk> of <unk>  and I'm going to do something <unk>
It has never <unk> me <unk> <unk>  and it felt <unk> to ask the questions of people --  and I <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> means your <unk> is <unk> after a <unk> <unk> <unk> without having a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to have <unk> in the life of a <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk>  which is to <unk> the <unk> of a life with <unk>  which which is my <unk>
But in reality we <unk> of course, we have changed by a <unk>  whether it's <unk> <unk> or both <unk>
And my <unk> is that a good thing.
<unk> is not <unk> where we should be <unk>  to live <unk>
It's a part of our lives.
I tend to see it as my <unk>
<unk> I see a lot of <unk> sometimes <unk> but it's always at me.
I'm not going to <unk> the impact and the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And there is <unk> and challenge in life,  and it's all really and for everybody back <unk>  but the question not <unk> you will have to <unk> <unk>  but how you do to <unk>
So our <unk> is not simply to <unk> our <unk> for <unk>  but they <unk> to <unk> it.
We don't <unk> our children --  if we <unk> them feel that they can't be able to <unk>
There's a important difference and <unk>  between the <unk> fact that I am a <unk>  and the <unk> <unk> <unk> about whether I'm not <unk>
<unk> <unk> the only real <unk> I <unk> all the time.  is the world that was always <unk> you could <unk> me with that <unk>
In our <unk> to <unk> our <unk>  by <unk> they <unk> the <unk> <unk> of their medical <unk>  or even a <unk> of the <unk> quality of life, we need to make sure that we should be sure that we don't really <unk>
It may be the current way of looking at what is piece of <unk> to you, and how to <unk> it <unk> somebody <unk> <unk>  than the <unk> itself.
<unk> not to go from the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> not to <unk> their <unk>  we create a new disease <unk> the natural <unk> that they might have already <unk>
In fact, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for our <unk>
So we should go through the <unk> of human <unk>
The <unk> is that there is a <unk>  between those <unk> <unk> and our best creative <unk>
It's not about that difficult to <unk> those difficult times <unk> or <unk> if something we want to <unk> or under the <unk> <unk>  but instead instead instead instead of <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
And maybe the idea is that I want to bring to <unk>  that you don't need to <unk> <unk>  but you need to open <unk>  but you should be <unk> it <unk>  to <unk> but a <unk> <unk> -- maybe even <unk>
If we see <unk> as of course, <unk> and <unk>  than we might feel less by <unk>
This year, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> of Charles <unk> <unk> and then he wrote 150 years ago --  <unk> I think the fact that the human <unk>
<unk> <unk> it's not the <unk> species that <unk>  <unk> the most <unk>  but the kind of <unk> it <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> other from <unk> work we can <unk> that  the human ability to survive and <unk>  <unk> is <unk> by the <unk> <unk> through <unk> to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> that's our greatest <unk>
<unk> we <unk> on the <unk> <unk> we don't know what we <unk>
<unk> is that <unk> <unk> our <unk>  <unk> a <unk> of our own <unk>
So we should give ourselves a <unk>
We can <unk> us as <unk> <unk> <unk>
Maybe we can see it as a <unk>
<unk> is <unk> we don't have <unk>
And I think the most important <unk> we have given ourselves  the understanding of <unk>
Who is <unk>
There's no <unk>
There's <unk> There's <unk> There is no <unk>
And who would want to <unk> <unk> person to <unk> <unk>
I <unk>
If we can <unk> the <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> to one of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>  then we can <unk> the power of a lot more kids <unk>  and they <unk> their <unk> and <unk> with the community to <unk>
<unk> tell us that the only thing that we <unk> people should be <unk> of our <unk>  is <unk> is <unk> to <unk>
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> years ago --  their <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  maybe because the <unk> and <unk> of these people.  value for the community to be <unk>  they were <unk> these people not as <unk> and <unk> <unk>  they were seen as a <unk> and <unk>
A few years ago, I was on the market in the village that I was <unk>  in that red piece in <unk> <unk> <unk> and I was <unk> about a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> I had a short <unk>
I heard a man who said, "If <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> it was an older <unk> No idea that he was.
I said, <unk> we don't know <unk> I can't <unk>
He said, <unk> you don't know that we don't know that we don't know each other.
When we <unk> <unk> I <unk> you from your <unk> <unk>
<unk> that <unk>
And of course, when it was <unk>
This man was <unk> <unk>  a man I just <unk> through my <unk> stories of that day, because I came out of the <unk> two weeks to <unk>
My <unk> <unk> <unk> was already at <unk> <unk> <unk>  so the man who was a <unk> for my <unk>
And because I was born without <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and a few <unk> on one and on the other <unk>  had to <unk> the bad news <unk>
He said to me, "I had to give your parents the <unk>  that you could never <unk>  and never <unk> the <unk> that other children have <unk>  and completely no <unk> life could have <unk> life --  and from that moment you from me.
And the extraordinary thing that he was told that he <unk>  <unk> for my <unk>  or it was that I <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the second <unk> with the <unk> during <unk> <unk>  <unk> or one of my <unk> <unk> or one of my <unk> <unk>  and he was using it, in his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to school and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And of course, he <unk> this is the <unk> of the human <unk>
No <unk> can <unk> how powerful this can be <unk> <unk> for the quality of <unk> life.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  he said, "I <unk> that if it's not <unk> <unk>  and even with only <unk> <unk>  a child from itself will <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> had <unk>
And he <unk> that there is a difference between medical <unk> and what anybody could do with it.
And in the course of time is my thinking <unk>  <unk> if you had asked me as a <unk>  or I <unk> my <unk> real legs would have no time <unk>
<unk> <unk> I went to <unk>
If you ask me now I don't know it just like that.
That's because of the <unk> that I had <unk>  not <unk> the <unk> that <unk>
And maybe this is a <unk>  because I'm more <unk> of people who have <unk> for me --  than the ones who wanted to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> you need one human <unk>  that you show the <unk> of your own <unk> and you go there.
If you can give somebody the <unk> to their own <unk>  the human mind is so <unk> if you can <unk> that  and on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you can <unk> them in the best way.
You teach them to <unk> <unk>
The <unk> meaning of the word <unk> <unk> <unk>
That <unk> that's what <unk> is <unk> to <unk> <unk>
So <unk> which <unk> we want to go <unk>
There was a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> In the United States we call it <unk>
They <unk> students in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> get a <unk> <unk> the best <unk> <unk>
<unk> a period of three months  they gave <unk> students a <unk>  and told they were <unk> they were <unk> that they were <unk>
At the end of the three months  <unk> they <unk> on <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of this study is that they were <unk> the <unk> that they were <unk>
And that happened after three <unk>
<unk> who had been in school <unk> next to the people who had <unk>
And a <unk> part of this research was that the <unk> had been <unk> <unk>
The <unk> didn't know that something was <unk>
And she was <unk> these are the students with <unk> this one with <unk>
And so she <unk> and so they <unk> them.
I think the only real <unk> is a <unk> mind --  a <unk> mind doesn't know any <unk>
It doesn't see any <unk>
It has our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if we can <unk> the mind to <unk> the <unk> to keep <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>  to be <unk> and <unk> <unk>  to be <unk>
If a mind these <unk> <unk> we are able to <unk> new <unk>  new ways to be <unk>
I want to <unk> with a <unk>  by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that my friend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's called "The <unk> that only four words <unk>
<unk> child <unk> <unk>  not the God of <unk>  not the God of <unk>  but the God who <unk> only four words that he <unk>  <unk> <unk> with <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> with me.
Thank you.
