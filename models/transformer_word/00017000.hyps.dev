<unk> years I showed these two <unk> to show these two <unk> to show that the <unk> <unk>  that the last three million years -- the size of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
But this <unk> actually the <unk> of this particular problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice <unk>
The <unk> on the <unk> is in a sense, the <unk> heart of our <unk> <unk>
It <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk>
The next <unk> I show  is a <unk> version of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The <unk> ice is <unk> in <unk>
And as you can see it <unk>
That's the <unk> ice during the <unk>
And the <unk> in the <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk> five years or <unk> <unk> <unk> is almost like <unk>  that from the body is <unk> here.
And in 25 years it's from this to this <unk>
And that is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and there is a very large amount of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> when the <unk> is <unk> in <unk>
<unk> with the <unk> amount of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that could <unk> if we <unk> the <unk> <unk>
In a few <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>  <unk> with another <unk> to another <unk>
<unk>
One is that this is that this huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk>
<unk> <unk> is bigger than <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk>  because it <unk> <unk> is this place where it <unk> in the sea <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>
On the other side of the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
More specific is the ice in the <unk>  of the <unk> very quickly on the <unk> <unk> with <unk> some <unk>
The whole <unk> is <unk> <unk> just like <unk>
In the <unk> the <unk> on two <unk> <unk>  there are new <unk> that had been <unk> a few years ago.
40 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of that <unk>
In the <unk> this <unk> is the source of <unk> for this city.
There's more <unk>
But when they <unk> <unk> it also <unk>
In <unk> there was a <unk>  of 40 percent in the <unk> of <unk>
It <unk> in the <unk>
And as you could be <unk> the <unk> <unk>
This global <unk> has <unk>  to a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
And the number of <unk> around the world,  is <unk> with a <unk> and never <unk> <unk>
<unk> times more in the last 30 years  than in the <unk> <unk> years.
This pattern is completely <unk>
If you <unk> it from a <unk> <unk>  you can see what <unk> here.
In the last five years  we have 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every <unk> <unk>
25 <unk> <unk> every day in our <unk>  Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  from <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  <unk> there is a <unk> of oxygen in the <unk>
The only big <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> for 20 percent of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> and <unk> is the problem.
The United States is one of the two <unk> <unk> with <unk>
And there was a <unk> to build a lot more <unk>
But we see a <unk>
These are the <unk> of which the <unk> was <unk> in the last few years and where green <unk> were <unk>
But there is a political <unk>  on the <unk> in our country.
The <unk> and <unk>  gave last year <unk> million dollars to <unk>  which is a <unk> <unk>
And I did that I think about something <unk>
<unk> the <unk> was <unk> with me in <unk> <unk> about four billion <unk> <unk> <unk>
You probably saw it probably in the <unk>
This is the one of the biggest <unk> in America.
This happened around the <unk>
One of the <unk> of the <unk> around the <unk> was <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He is <unk> in <unk>  and he makes our economy <unk>
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> with the day.
He is <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk>
Here's a big <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
The biggest <unk> of the country is the big <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they don't know where they were talking about.
Al <unk> So the <unk> has two <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a little bit from one of them.
<unk> <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> as a <unk> <unk> for our <unk>
That is why the most important goal is to <unk> a <unk> <unk> to give a <unk> <unk>  <unk> for the light and the <unk> of <unk>  the truth about <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not <unk>
We think it's <unk> --  and the <unk> still <unk>
So, don't worry about <unk>
So let me <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you have a lot about <unk>
So let's take a <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The <unk> is what <unk>
But that's the sound of <unk> <unk>
<unk> the fact that the <unk> of <unk> one of the most important <unk> of the Earth is changing the <unk>  <unk> that you see here everything.
<unk> <unk> this is the <unk> <unk> of the day.
Al <unk> <unk> <unk> the positive <unk>  with our economic challenges and the <unk> of national <unk>
<unk> <unk> America <unk> in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The red <unk> at all of this <unk>  is our <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
But now there is a <unk> new solution to <unk> <unk>
<unk> America.
And a plan to get here to the work <unk>  a plan that makes us <unk> and the <unk> of the Earth <unk>
<unk> a solution that <unk> is <unk> enough to <unk> our problems.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Al <unk> And the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And one of the <unk> ways of making a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our planet to help our planet <unk>
Man: Here is the future. <unk> <unk> a new <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to become <unk>
Al <unk> There is a old <unk> <unk> saying, "If you want to be <unk>
If you want to go <unk> <unk>
We need to go <unk> and <unk>
Thank you very much.
<unk> year I gave a <unk> over the <unk> at <unk>
And I <unk> to come back with a <unk>  about how this machine works.
So here I <unk> for those who don't <unk>  the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk>  <unk> <unk> in <unk>
It has to <unk> <unk>  who were <unk> less than a <unk> second after the universe <unk>  until <unk> <unk> million times a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the machine under <unk>
We took pictures of that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And this is the one that I work with. It's called the <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> feet in <unk>
<unk> picture of <unk> in <unk>  so you can see the <unk>
At 10 <unk> last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by <unk>
That <unk> for a <unk> in the <unk>
It's a picture of the first <unk>  that was all around the <unk> <unk>  and with <unk> <unk> <unk> with a piece of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In other words, when we saw that <unk> on 10 <unk>  we knew that the machine <unk>  which is a huge <unk>
I don't know if this was the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> when somebody went to Google and saw the <unk> look like this.
That means that we have a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
A week later, we had a problem with the <unk>  what to do with this <unk> <unk> <unk>
That <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a thousand <unk>
And the <unk> of you say, <unk> <unk> It's too small <unk>
They can do that because  they're <unk> on very low <unk>
So on <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> than the space between the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>
In one of the <unk> between nine a thousand <unk> in the <unk> was a <unk>
<unk> was <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> and there was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This was the <unk>
This is <unk>  if you <unk> you <unk> that those <unk> more than 20 <unk> <unk>  and they were about 30 <unk>
We <unk> about 50 <unk>
We needed to <unk> what we <unk>
We all <unk> they were <unk>
Now they are back on <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
We will be able to <unk>  and we expect <unk> in <unk> or <unk> <unk> so that we can go back with the <unk>  what the <unk> of the universe.
Now, of course,  that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> about the value of <unk> <unk> It's too <unk>
I think the fact that it's so <unk>  the fact that we're going to go beyond <unk> the value of things like the <unk>
I <unk> the last words on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> was <unk> his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> was so <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> of the human mind than to take that our images of science <unk>  that our <unk> is not <unk> <unk> <unk> and that our <unk>  that is <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk>
I'd like to begin to ask you to go back to your <unk>  when you <unk> with <unk> <unk>
When you found out how to go to <unk>  they were <unk> and <unk>  You actually learn how to <unk>  by the <unk> with <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is very <unk>  with the world around us.
If a <unk>  <unk> by the <unk> of physical <unk> with objects --  with my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> <unk> --  I started <unk> to ask -- what if we could use a <unk>  instead of using one <unk> <unk> as a a <unk> <unk>  which is <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and can <unk> as we <unk>
And this question was so <unk> that we decided to <unk> a <unk>  by building <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> a <unk> computer  the size of a <unk>
They can be <unk> <unk>  they can <unk> each other <unk> their movement <unk>  and they <unk> a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is the physical <unk> just like <unk> they can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>
<unk> are <unk> an example of a new <unk>  for the <unk> of digital <unk>
<unk> this <unk> a more physical <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> are aware of their <unk> and even of the way we <unk> them  there are different new and fun <unk>
I will <unk> with some simple <unk>
This <unk> is <unk> to <unk> a video <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>
<unk> next to each other <unk> they're going to <unk>
When they become <unk> they can <unk> this  and can be <unk>
<unk> feel <unk> and <unk>
We <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of this <unk>  the use of <unk> <unk> <unk>  as the <unk> of a color as it was a <unk>
In this example three <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I can use them to <unk> color in a <unk>  where they're <unk>
If we have <unk> <unk> we go back.
There are some <unk> <unk> for the <unk>  <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk>  where we want to give people the ability to <unk> things <unk>  and the result of the <unk>
And here I show --  This is the development of a <unk> <unk> by a simple <unk>
And here we show a game that is a <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> is that you get in every <unk>  a <unk> <unk> on any <unk>  and <unk> words are <unk> in a <unk>
After about 30 <unk> it is <unk> <unk>  and <unk> a new series of <unk> with <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
These are some kids <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I'm <unk> it to make it <unk> and let them <unk> and make a video of <unk>
They were really <unk>
And one of the most interesting things about this <unk>  is that people don't need <unk>
<unk> you need to say <unk> is <unk> <unk>  and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people on the <unk>
That's our <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> he just <unk> the <unk> <unk>
For him, this was just <unk>
Here's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk>
This is <unk> that <unk>
He can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- just by <unk> the <unk> with that <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
Here he <unk> the <unk>
<unk> The sun comes up.
David <unk> Now he has a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> The <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
By <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> each other --  is <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and so his own story.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> It's a story with an open <unk>
and he <unk> how it <unk>
<unk> The <unk> <unk>
<unk> The last example I'm going to show today  Is a <unk> and <unk> <unk>  that we have <unk> <unk>  where every <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>
<unk> has four different <unk>  where you can choose which you want to use which you <unk>
These <unk> can be <unk> in <unk> <unk>  so that you can <unk> the pattern itself.
You <unk> a sound in the pattern by the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>  There are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
They become a sound <unk> and <unk> by <unk>
<unk> the general <unk> like <unk> and <unk>  who are <unk> on the entire <unk>
Let's <unk>
<unk>  <unk> We start with a <unk> <unk>  <unk> in two <unk> to a first <unk> <unk> by extra <unk>
Now I <unk> the <unk>
<unk>  <unk> Now I <unk> a little <unk>
<unk>  <unk> And now I <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> so I can <unk> the effect of <unk>
<unk>  <unk> I can <unk> it by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
<unk>  <unk> Now I <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
<unk>  <unk> I can <unk> the pattern as it <unk>
So I <unk> <unk> <unk> so not to <unk> but I can <unk>  it was <unk> and <unk> <unk> like I <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> of the whole <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
And as you can see,  <unk> my <unk> to make new <unk> <unk>  that are better <unk> in the way our brain and <unk> <unk>
And today, I had time to show you one new <unk> in this <unk>  with some <unk> that we are developing in the <unk>
And the thought I would like to <unk>  is that this is just the <unk> to a whole new generation of <unk>  <unk> the <unk> with digital <unk> <unk> <unk> that the information to our world  as we want.
I thank you very much.
I look at it and I look at it all of you.
I'm <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life long as I am a <unk> of <unk>  and I don't think it's ever going to change that.
And yet there is a little bit more <unk>  in my life and <unk>  which I had to <unk> my work again.
It started a book that I <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that was very <unk> <unk> to my <unk> work  the whole world was about <unk> and an international <unk> was <unk>
And the <unk> is that people <unk> me all over and always <unk> <unk> as if I'm <unk>
<unk> where --
People come to me and ask you <unk>  <unk> you're not going to be able to <unk> this <unk> <unk>
<unk> you're not <unk> you <unk> your whole life will be <unk> but never <unk> a book <unk>  where people will <unk> <unk>
Are you not <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that would be very <unk> But I remember --  that I was <unk> 20 years ago -- I was when a <unk> --  if I was going to be <unk>
People said, <unk> you're not <unk> you're not <unk>
<unk> you're not <unk> to <unk> that you will <unk> <unk>
<unk> you're not <unk> that your life will <unk> your life to this work without any <unk>  and you're going to die on the <unk> of your <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in that <unk>
In the <unk> my answer to those questions <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I'm <unk> for all these things that are <unk>
<unk> <unk>
But I am also for a lot of other things --  you don't want to know what what I <unk>
For <unk> for example, and other <unk> things.
But I am <unk>  I'm asking myself the last time where that fear comes <unk>
Is it <unk>
Is it <unk> that somebody is <unk>  <unk> <unk> to the work that they <unk> to their <unk> on Earth <unk>
What is so <unk> creative <unk>  that we worry about the <unk> of the <unk> of it on the <unk>  something that <unk> work on <unk>
Take my <unk> He was <unk> <unk>  and I can't <unk> that there was a <unk> in the 40 years that he had been working on a <unk>
So <unk> <unk> how is it with your <unk>
No, not about <unk>
To be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> also didn't have the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> who have these kinds of <unk>
Not only <unk> other creative people have <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just look at the <unk> <unk>  under the most <unk> creative <unk> of the <unk> century.
<unk> <unk> <unk> often <unk> by <unk>
And even those who <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
In the last <unk> for his <unk> said <unk> <unk>  <unk> every one of my books is a piece of <unk> <unk>
That is a pretty thing to say about your <unk>
But of these kinds of <unk> we don't <unk>
We all heard this <unk>  and we all heard it with <unk>
The <unk> thought is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> and that a <unk> <unk> will lead to <unk>
That's why I want to <unk> everybody here today,  can you <unk> with that idea <unk>
<unk> you <unk>
Because now I think about <unk>  I don't think it's not a <unk> at all.
I think it's <unk>
And also <unk>
I would not like to see that this century.
We can <unk> creative <unk> much better to live <unk>
I'm sure it would be for me, in my <unk>  particularly <unk> to go to that dark <unk>
<unk> the <unk> in which my <unk> is now <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can maybe four <unk> <unk>
<unk> is going to be <unk>  by the <unk> of the <unk> as the work that <unk>  on that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we are with friends under <unk> so I can tell you <unk>  <unk> <unk> my greatest success all of me.
<unk> what a <unk>
And if you're going to think about it --  <unk> in the morning to nine hours of the <unk>
So I don't want that.
I would rather <unk> the work that I <unk>
The question is:
And after a long time I have come to the <unk>  I can only go through a <unk>  if I <unk> a <unk> in the process of <unk>
I have to write <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> between <unk> and my <unk> very <unk> fear --  for the <unk> on my <unk> <unk>
I <unk> in the last year <unk> in ways to do that.
I am in history <unk>  and I have <unk> in other <unk>  to see or others may have found a better way to help people <unk> to <unk>  with the <unk> <unk> of the creative <unk>
My <unk> has <unk> me at the old <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> up, because it's a long and <unk> story.
In the time of the old <unk> and <unk>  <unk> people don't think <unk> was <unk>
<unk> <unk> that <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk>  who was from a <unk> <unk> place to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> he <unk> that he had a <unk>  who <unk> him <unk>
The <unk> had a <unk> idea.
And they <unk> about <unk> creative mind a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is that the <unk>  with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
In their <unk> a <unk> was a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>  who <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
A little like <unk> the <unk>
If the <unk> of the <unk> was <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> he gave <unk>
<unk> That's exactly the <unk> that I was talking about  the <unk> <unk> against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how to do that in his work <unk>
And the <unk> was <unk> in <unk>  against <unk> <unk>
If your work was <unk> you didn't get all the <unk>
Everybody knew that a <unk> <unk> you had <unk>
<unk> your work <unk> than <unk> <unk>
Everybody knew you had a pretty <unk> <unk>
<unk> time has been <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
And then the <unk> came up and everything <unk>
There is a very new <unk>  the individual <unk> is the <unk> of the universe  and state above all the <unk> and <unk>
No space for <unk> <unk> from the <unk> world.
That was the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
People <unk> <unk> is completely from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And for the first time in history --  was about <unk> said that they were a <unk>  and not they had a <unk>
I have to say that I have to say that a big <unk>
To make one <unk> one <unk>  <unk> that he <unk> or she is it <unk>  the <unk> the <unk> the source of everything that <unk> <unk> and the familiar of everything that <unk> <unk> and the familiar <unk> is too much for a <unk> human <unk>
Can you ask someone to <unk> the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> to huge <unk> <unk> and there are <unk> high <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I think this pressure  the last 500 years a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if that is so <unk> and I think,  than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> we do this <unk>
<unk> we <unk> on a older understanding of the relationship between human human <unk> and the creative <unk>
<unk> not.
<unk> we can <unk> 500 years <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
<unk> are <unk> in the audience who have <unk> scientific <unk>  <unk> about the idea that <unk> <unk> <unk>  with some <unk> <unk> the work of <unk> to <unk> <unk>
It doesn't seem that I'm going to <unk> all of you <unk>
And yet I <unk> it <unk>
Why <unk>
Why should we not have that thought <unk>
It <unk> as much as all of the other <unk>  of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that decided  in the creative <unk>
<unk> that one has something to do is to <unk>  -- so in fact, all the <unk> here --  -- you know, the creative process not always <unk>
It was almost <unk> <unk>
I <unk> the great American <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
She is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> whole life <unk> they <unk>
She told me about her <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> if she was on the <unk> to the work was a <unk> <unk> <unk>  about the country.
It was so she said that there was a big <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> than the country to <unk>
She felt that the <unk> began to <unk> her <unk>  <unk> and knew her at that time, but one thing to do is <unk>  <unk> for her life.
They <unk> than to <unk>  <unk> by the <unk> and they had to <unk> as soon as possible.
When it was <unk> through her <unk> <unk>  was that her only chance to write it <unk>
<unk> she wasn't <unk>
Then they <unk> and they don't <unk> the <unk>
And it was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by her <unk>  <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> -- in her words -- looking for another <unk>
And there were also <unk> --  I think this is the <unk> part of the story --  that they <unk> the <unk> almost <unk>
And then she was looking for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it <unk> through her <unk>
<unk> at that time she had a <unk> <unk>
And with her other <unk> so told me --  <unk> she <unk> the <unk>
She <unk> the <unk> at his <unk>  and <unk> it back in her <unk>  while they <unk> it.
And in that <unk> the <unk> was <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> but it was in <unk> <unk>
When I <unk> I thought -- some <unk>  so <unk> my creative process.
This is how my creative process. I'm not a <unk>
I'm a <unk>  that every day on the same <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But even in that <unk> <unk>  I have a lot of <unk>
You're also going to know it,  that feeling that there creative ideas in your <unk> from a <unk>  that you can <unk>
So what is that <unk>
How can we use it without that we <unk> <unk>
And in a way that <unk>
And the best <unk> example I can <unk> <unk>  is <unk> <unk> <unk>
A few years ago, I <unk> him for a <unk>
We had the <unk>
<unk> is actually a lot of his life has been the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk>  from all the power <unk> is trying to get <unk>  on the <unk> creative <unk> in him.
With the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And one day he <unk> in <unk> <unk> over the <unk> and changed the process of <unk>
And as he was so <unk> he heard a <unk> of a <unk>
The <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a beautiful <unk> and he wanted the <unk>
But it <unk>
He had no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> at <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  "I <unk> the <unk> <unk> and then it <unk> me <unk>
I'm not good <unk> I can <unk> it.
He didn't get in <unk>  but he <unk> that whole <unk> process and did something <unk>
He looked up to the <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> you can't see I behind the <unk> <unk>
Do you really <unk> I can now <unk> a <unk>
If you really want this <unk> is <unk> you have to get later --  if I have time for you.
<unk> <unk> go <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk>  And from that moment <unk> the process is very different.
The work itself is <unk> with the <unk> dark <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> that the creative process in him.  <unk> when he <unk> <unk> from the <unk>
The <unk> was too close to the <unk> and <unk> only <unk>
<unk> realized that there was no reason to <unk> <unk>
It could also be a <unk> <unk> <unk>  a kind of <unk> between <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That story has changed my way of <unk>
I had already <unk> <unk>
I was in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in a given I was in <unk>
You know that <unk> your work is <unk> but not good <unk>  and you think it's going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not just <unk> <unk> <unk>
I wanted to <unk> the whole project <unk>
And then I <unk> that <unk> to his <unk> <unk> and I also decided to <unk> a <unk>
I <unk> my <unk>  and I <unk> up to a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk>  we know <unk> that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have everything in <unk> which I <unk>
<unk> I can't <unk>
If you think it's better <unk> you have to do your <unk>
<unk> do you <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just <unk> <unk> because that's my job.
<unk> and in the <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>  <unk> it comes up here.
<unk> ago in the <unk> came up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
That was always <unk> because the <unk> were <unk> <unk>
But <unk> very <unk> happened something <unk>
And one of those <unk> was <unk>
You know what I mean by <unk>  you've ever ever seen something like this in a <unk> <unk>
It was like the time <unk>  and the <unk> by a <unk> <unk>
He didn't do anything else but the thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> he was no longer just like a <unk>
In <unk> under <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> him.
If something like this <unk> people knew what it was  Then they started <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because it was <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>  When the <unk> <unk> <unk> they brought these <unk> with it.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, you hear that day at <unk> and <unk>
If a <unk> in <unk> something <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk>
<unk> what we <unk>
<unk> is that the <unk> the <unk> the next <unk>  at the <unk> <unk> that he <unk> on <unk> to 11 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And at that moment, he is a little older man with <unk> <unk> <unk>  who will never come to such a <unk>
<unk> will never be somebody in his <unk> during his <unk>
What should he now is the rest of his <unk>
That's <unk>
That's really hard to <unk>  for a creative <unk>
But it doesn't have to be <unk>
<unk> you don't <unk>  that the most <unk> <unk> of your person from <unk>
<unk> you <unk> that you <unk> them for a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when you're <unk> they become <unk> to someone else.
So <unk> <unk> everything.
I <unk> <unk> that <unk>
And the last few months I worked on a book, which is going to <unk> The book which is going to be <unk>
The <unk> of those <unk> <unk>
If my mind <unk> with me to the <unk>  <unk> I keep the same <unk>  <unk> not <unk> <unk>
<unk> just <unk> your job.
<unk> just do you <unk> what it is.
If the <unk> your <unk> is too <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> <unk> you are <unk>  <unk> to <unk> in your work at <unk> moment something of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> that doesn't <unk> than that.
And also <unk> <unk>
I believe that <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, I've been talking about a few of these <unk>  about human <unk> and what that can <unk>  and what it can <unk> <unk>
We actually <unk> from a new <unk>  we were the biology of <unk>  and now we're trying to <unk> from that digital code to <unk> from a new <unk> in biology  with the <unk> and <unk> of life.
So we've always been <unk> to ask the big questions.
"What is <unk> is something that I think a lot of <unk>  in different different <unk>
We have different <unk> <unk>  it back to <unk> <unk>
We are now almost 20 years of the <unk>
When we <unk> the human <unk> <unk>  it was from the <unk> world of the <unk>  to the digital world of the <unk>
Now we're trying to <unk> we can live <unk>  or can we <unk> new life <unk>  from this digital <unk>
This is the map of a little <unk>  <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
And we have <unk> to see if we can get to a <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> in the order of a hundred <unk> <unk>  of the 500 or <unk> that are there.
But if we look at the <unk> <unk>  this is <unk> simple <unk> compared to the <unk>
<unk> me, this is <unk>
But if we look at all the <unk> we can <unk> per piece of <unk>  is the very <unk> that this was going to be <unk> a <unk>
And we decided that the only <unk> <unk> <unk> was to <unk> this <unk>  so that we could <unk> the <unk>  to do the <unk> of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking <unk>  <unk> we <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>  these very big <unk> that we have never seen before.
And if we can do that, a <unk> <unk>
A <unk> is <unk> but a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, our <unk> of the <unk> of life is <unk>  on <unk> <unk> <unk>
Our ability to write the genetic <unk>  <unk> is pretty <unk> but it's <unk>
And our last <unk> it would be places in a <unk> <unk>
We are here over 15 years ago.
There were a number of <unk> to start with a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the first <unk>
But it turns out that the <unk> of DNA  very <unk>
There are <unk> machines in the world  that little pieces of DNA <unk> 30 to 50 <unk> in <unk>  and it's a <unk> <unk> so the longer you <unk> it.  the longer <unk>
So we had to make a new <unk>  for the <unk> of these little <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk>
And this was our first <unk> to start with the digital <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's a little virus that bacteria <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> did the <unk>
and had a <unk>  of about <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> when we started a <unk> piece of chemical <unk>  in the bacteria <unk> and the bacteria <unk> the genetic code went <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> particles when <unk> from the <unk>  they came back and <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> in conversation with the <unk>  and I said to them that model but already too well.
They <unk> more than you.
That's why we think this is a situation  which the software can build his own <unk>  in a <unk> system.
But we wanted something a lot of <unk>
We wanted to build the entire <unk> <unk>
That's more than <unk> genetic <unk>
So we decided to build them in <unk> the size of <unk>  so we could <unk> the <unk> <unk>
to <unk>  what the <unk> <unk> of a living <unk>
The design is <unk>  and if you start with digital information in the computer  it has to be very <unk>
When we first <unk> this <unk> <unk> in <unk>  was the <unk> one <unk> per 10,000 <unk>
<unk> we found after <unk>  <unk> <unk> If we had the original <unk> <unk>  then it was not able to <unk> the <unk>
<unk> of the design is the design of <unk>  which are 50 <unk> long <unk> with all the other pieces of 50 <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that we need to design so they can go together.
We design <unk> <unk>
You might have <unk> that we <unk>
<unk> <unk>  we have a <unk> genetic <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of that <unk>  <unk> for <unk> 20 <unk> --  that there is a <unk> <unk>  for every <unk>
So we can use the genetic <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we just <unk> <unk>
Some were <unk> that there were no <unk>
We have these pieces of so <unk>  that we can <unk> them with <unk>
There are <unk> they <unk> and <unk>
And we started making pieces of <unk>  which was five to <unk> pieces that were five to <unk> <unk> and you have pieces of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> to <unk>
In each <unk> we <unk> a <unk> of these <unk>  so we could <unk> them because we want to create a process that is very <unk> --  that you will see <unk>
We're trying to achieve <unk>
So this looks like a <unk>
And as soon as we get to the really big <unk> --  more than <unk> <unk> --  <unk> they don't grow so easy to <unk> in <unk> <unk>
That <unk> the <unk> of all the modern <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
So we went to <unk> at other <unk>
We <unk> a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that is used by biology to <unk> <unk>  that <unk> can <unk> <unk>
Here's an example of it.
There is a <unk> named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that three million <unk> of <unk>
That's what you see in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hours later he <unk> it again.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be completely <unk>
They can live in a <unk>
I know absolutely certainly that there can be life in the space <unk>  that can <unk> a new <unk> <unk>
<unk> has <unk> <unk> that there is a lot of them here is <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that we've done with this <unk> -- actually just <unk>  with the right design of the <unk> we <unk> them in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This is not a <unk>  this is a <unk> <unk>
It's such a big <unk>  that we can see it with a <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> over a period of six <unk>
This is the <unk> that we <unk> <unk>
This is more than <unk> <unk> of genetic <unk>
It's the biggest <unk> ever made by people, with a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is more than 300 <unk>
If we were going to <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> without <unk>  then it is <unk> <unk> <unk>  only to <unk> the genetic <unk>
<unk> how do we <unk> a <unk> How do we <unk>
And with a virus it's pretty <unk>
And with a <unk> it's a lot of <unk>
It's also <unk> if you <unk> your <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>  You <unk> just <unk> the <unk>  and it does another <unk>  and that's what you know as the <unk>
And the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  but we have <unk> that we can <unk> a full <unk>  of a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> to a <unk>  and can <unk> it.
We have a <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
These are about so far from each other.
We <unk> some extra <unk> so we could <unk> this <unk>
We have the <unk> with <unk> <unk> to make all the <unk>
It was pretty <unk> when we <unk> this in the <unk> --  and you'll be the very <unk>  <unk> images here can <unk> --  the new <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
And we even thought he was going to be <unk>  but we were trying to <unk> the process of <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
We discover all kinds of  who have a second <unk> or a third somewhere <unk>  which they have thousands of <unk>  which they have thousands of <unk> in one time to the <unk>
People who are <unk> -- as if there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are <unk> that <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>
It <unk> that in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The cell -- the <unk> that we <unk> --
It was <unk> and it was <unk>  the other <unk> as <unk> <unk>  <unk> it up, and that's why we <unk>  <unk> it was <unk>
He was <unk> because of the genes that we had <unk>
And in very short time  <unk> all of the <unk> of one <unk> and changed the new <unk>  based on the new software that we <unk> in the cell <unk>
All the <unk> <unk>  the <unk> <unk> --  when we <unk> the genetic <unk> it was exactly what it <unk>
This is going to be <unk> as a <unk>  but we are in <unk> by changing the <unk> of the software <unk> to change the <unk>
<unk> I've been <unk> that this is not a <unk> --  this is <unk> in <unk> billion years <unk>  and I <unk> that we might almost <unk> a new version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  where there is a big <unk> <unk> of new <unk>  which is based on this digital <unk>
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clear if you look at what's <unk>
We're going to <unk> <unk>  to <unk> billion people, over the next 40 years.
To <unk> it in my <unk>  I was born in <unk>
There are three people on this <unk>
for each of us that in <unk> in <unk>  within 40 years that there will be four <unk>
We have <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> water,  <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk>
That is <unk> to do that for nine to do that <unk>
We use five billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's 100 <unk> a day.
When we do biological <unk> in <unk>  or any process to <unk> that is going to be a huge <unk>
And then of course, there is all that  <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> all of our global <unk> now we have a <unk> with about 20 million <unk>  and I would like to see as the <unk> for the future.
And the <unk> had a <unk> of different <unk> and look at the <unk> that is <unk>
We are <unk> <unk>  by a biological <unk> and our <unk>
We now have <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> to do something called <unk> <unk>
We now have the ability to build a big <unk>  that can make a million <unk> a day.
If you <unk> to the <unk> of 20 million different <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>  to make <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk>  than we can do with a small team --  can we do with a small team in the last 20 years of the <unk>
And it's only <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> for <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk>  of some real <unk> that we work, so that you can actually go on the <unk>  and a new kind of <unk> on the <unk>
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on <unk> <unk>
<unk> you've seen <unk> <unk>  just a bad <unk>
We have second <unk> and third generation <unk>  that will come out of <unk>  like <unk> or different kinds of <unk>
But the only way that we think of biology can <unk> without <unk>  the <unk> <unk> higher and <unk> the <unk>  is if we start start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are <unk>  and so we are <unk> <unk> that <unk> it in that way.  and think we do the first generation of the first generation of <unk> within about 18 months of <unk>
<unk> and CO2 is one <unk> --  -- but by our global <unk>  -- we have all sorts of other <unk>
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk>
It lives in the <unk>  about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It makes <unk> of CO2  using <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
We can be <unk> or we can take CO2 CO2 CO2 <unk>  which is <unk> <unk> can be <unk> to <unk>  where it is <unk> CO2 <unk> to <unk> this process.
So in a short <unk>  we think we're able to be able to <unk>  on the <unk> <unk> "What is <unk>
We have <unk> you know --  the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> If you can't do this at TED, where <unk>
A important <unk>
But we're also working on the <unk> of this <unk>  to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This year was the <unk>  we always just just walk around the <unk> of the <unk> on the right <unk>
I think it can change  by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And here you see what the future is going to see --  because the <unk> is going to change the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and eventually <unk>
We are still far away from the <unk> of people.
Our goal is that we make a chance of <unk>  to survive long enough to survive that maybe long enough to survive that. Thank you very much.
And what I want to show you <unk>  is the <unk> of a new technology --  that we <unk> with a <unk> to <unk>  about a year ago. This is <unk>
And it's an environment in which you <unk> or <unk>  with <unk> <unk> visual data can work.
We're looking at a lot of <unk> of digital <unk> and can <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and it <unk> to our <unk>
And it doesn't matter how much information we <unk>  how big these <unk> or <unk>
Most of these are normal digital camera <unk>  but this is a <unk> of the <unk> or <unk>  but this is in 300 <unk> <unk>
It doesn't matter --  because the only thing that the <unk> should be <unk> on a <unk> <unk> the amount of <unk> on the <unk>
It's also a very <unk> <unk>
This is a completely <unk> an example of <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> house by <unk> Every <unk> is a <unk>
To <unk> that it's really <unk> and no <unk> and no <unk>  we can do something to show  that this is not a <unk>
<unk> this is a <unk> <unk> way to read a <unk>
I wouldn't <unk> it.
This is a <unk> <unk> This is a <unk> of The <unk>
Every big <unk> is the beginning of a <unk>
This gives you really the <unk> and the experience of a real <unk> <unk> or <unk>  which is a <unk> <unk>
We also did something with the <unk> of this <unk> of The <unk>
We made a <unk> <unk> of high <unk>  -- much higher than a normal <unk> --  -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the <unk> of this car <unk> you see it here.
Or other <unk> or even <unk> <unk> <unk>
And these ideas can really be <unk> -- that we can actually do the <unk> of <unk> through the <unk> <unk>
We hope that this doesn't mean more <unk>  and other kinds of <unk> -- no longer will be <unk>
And of course, <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for a technology like <unk>  I'll not <unk> time on <unk>  except we can <unk> this <unk>
These are all the <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now let's look at something <unk>
This is <unk> now <unk> on the <unk> you can see it.
This is a project called <unk> <unk> <unk>
One of them is <unk>  and the other is a very beautiful piece of <unk> research  by <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> A beautiful <unk>
So this is <unk> on the <unk> It's <unk> <unk>
When we do this, we see <unk>  that we <unk> through the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> of the images here is <unk>
The <unk> <unk> have these images <unk>  so they <unk> with the real space --  the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --  where they <unk> are. You see <unk>  of <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>  of <unk> <unk> and all these things are <unk>
I'm not sure whether there is time there is other <unk>
There are a lot of <unk>
I'd like to show one of <unk> original <unk> --  and this is an early <unk> of <unk>  that we were <unk> this <unk> -- to the <unk> which I have in my head   is the <unk> power of this <unk>  is the <unk> power of this <unk> <unk>
We had to <unk> the <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>  and you get images of people in <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
And every one of these <unk> <unk> gives a <unk> <unk>  which is part of this <unk>
And so these are all <unk> <unk> <unk>  who are <unk> <unk>
And we can <unk> in simple <unk>
You know, I had never <unk> that I would have ever <unk> at <unk>
It's so <unk> to become so <unk>
I believe that you can see that this many <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  a big number of <unk> <unk> in this <unk>
I'll try and find some strange <unk>
There are so many <unk> by <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> is even a series of pictures -- here they are.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> which is also <unk> by the <unk>
If we go through the <unk> in <unk>  in a <unk> picture of this <unk>
And what we want to say is that we can really do things with the social social <unk> This is now the data of <unk> everybody --  of <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> --  of <unk> on the Earth -- and <unk> that everything to do.
All these <unk> are <unk> with each other and <unk> together a whole  which is bigger than the <unk> of the <unk>
You have a model that <unk> from the entire Earth <unk>
<unk> this as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is something that <unk> in <unk>  when they <unk> the <unk> and also <unk> the <unk> of the people who are using it.
Their own pictures are <unk> of <unk> that somebody <unk>
If someone would want to <unk> all these <unk> <unk>  and they <unk> my picture of the <unk> <unk>  <unk> with all that <unk>  <unk> with all that <unk>  and I can use it as a access to that space,  that <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> and social <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And of course, the <unk> of this is a <unk> rich model of any interesting place on <unk>  which is not only from <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> is <unk> but also from the <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> I <unk> that what your software <unk> to make your software <unk> in a day, in the next <unk>  all images that are <unk> by everybody in the world.
<unk> <unk> What this is really <unk>
It <unk> to your <unk> <unk>
And it does that the basis of the data in the <unk>
And that is <unk> <unk> when you think of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> <unk>
When you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk>  <unk> a lot of information about what the <unk> <unk>
What if that <unk> <unk> is <unk> to all of your <unk>
Then the number of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and the amount of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It's a <unk> <unk>
CA: <unk> that's really <unk>
One of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>  and of <unk> research is the ability to live between them  who are not the old <unk> <unk>  who are not <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The science that <unk> is still beyond the <unk> <unk> <unk> or that the <unk> of <unk> still with <unk>  or that in the <unk>  <unk> still make <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk> you really <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>  not in a <unk> but it's not in a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> but only one of the <unk>
the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> our <unk> <unk> ago.
<unk> we all share the same <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> children in the world.
We all <unk>
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> by <unk>
So it can't be <unk> that we all <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But interesting is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> in every different <unk>
<unk> that is now about the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> in <unk>  or the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> in <unk>  the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --  This is the man who I <unk> by the <unk> --  This is the man who I <unk> by the <unk>  -- or a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of the world.
They all teach us that we can be <unk>  <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>
And if you think about it, you can only give that <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the world  a web of <unk> and <unk> life  that the planet is <unk> and for her as important is as the biological <unk> the <unk>
This cultural <unk> you can imagine a <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> you can <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  ideas, <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are <unk>  by the human <unk> since the beginning of our <unk>
The <unk> is the great <unk> of the <unk>
And she is the <unk> of all that we can be as <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like the <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>  is the <unk> that <unk> and still in much bigger <unk>
No <unk> would be <unk> <unk>  that <unk> half of all species on the point of all kinds of the point of <unk> is <unk> <unk>
And the most <unk> <unk>  not even in the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk>  for cultural <unk>
The best <unk> of this is the <unk> of <unk>
And everybody here was born here.  were <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>
A language is more than her <unk>  or her <unk> <unk>
A language is a <unk> of human <unk>
It's the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of every <unk> culture  the <unk> world.
Every language is a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And those <unk> <unk> are <unk> today is not <unk> in <unk> <unk>
They're <unk> no longer <unk>
<unk> means that, <unk> a change <unk>  that they're already <unk>
Is there something more <unk> than <unk> by <unk> <unk>  the last of your <unk> to be your language <unk>  not to have the <unk> of the <unk> by <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> of the children <unk>
<unk> that <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  every two weeks somewhere on <unk>  because every two weeks of <unk> there is an older  and die in the last <unk>  of an old <unk> <unk>
Some of you say,  <unk> the world are no better place -- if we all all the same language <unk> I said, <unk> let's take <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or <unk>  You will be <unk> <unk> how it would be <unk>  not your own <unk>
So what I really want to do today is you <unk> in a short journey of the <unk> that has to <unk> a <unk>  of what in fact, lost is <unk>
<unk> of us <unk> that when I talk about  <unk> other way of <unk>  I also really also really other ways.
Take this <unk> in the <unk>  the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that they <unk> from <unk> the <unk> in <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> that <unk>  the <unk> <unk> and <unk> not <unk>  because it <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have a <unk> <unk>  that <unk> is <unk> <unk>  you've got to <unk> somebody who <unk> a different language <unk>
This has his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>  but the <unk> <unk> in their <unk>  where six or seven <unk> are <unk> by this <unk> <unk> but you never hear a language <unk>
They simply listen and start <unk>
One of the <unk> <unk> that I have <unk>  the <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> were trying to <unk> five <unk>  but they made a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> they <unk>  <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  where they <unk> that this <unk> had never seen that this <unk> had never seen this <unk> <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> and they tried to find the shape behind the <unk>
When they didn't <unk> they <unk> that the <unk> <unk> them <unk>  <unk> the <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> <unk>
<unk> of their <unk> came out of <unk>
We could <unk> to eight <unk> back to eight <unk> --  where we <unk> two <unk> of a natural <unk>
And then we gave them that one man ever <unk> from <unk> <unk>  But at the same time,  But at the same time they had a <unk> <unk> knowledge of <unk>
Their <unk> <unk> could <unk> on 40 <unk> <unk> <unk> and tell what <unk> was it was.
<unk> years old, I got a <unk> <unk> <unk>  when my <unk> asked me  when I went to <unk>  to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that the basis of the power of <unk> <unk> <unk>  as well.
To be able to understand these <unk> <unk>  I had to learn something about this particular <unk>  of <unk> <unk> that is not a <unk> of black <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  very interesting.
<unk> I would ask you to call the big <unk>  what would you <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
One <unk> is always <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that Africa <unk> had no <unk> <unk>
<unk> is simply the <unk> <unk>  of these <unk> religious ideas and spread into the <unk> <unk> during the <unk>
What <unk> is so <unk>  is the living <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> the <unk>
The <unk> can be <unk> from under the Great <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>  so that the <unk> of the living <unk> is <unk> so that one <unk> moment the <unk> <unk>
That's why <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> go to the <unk> and talk about <unk>
We <unk> in the <unk> and become <unk>  And because you're so <unk> by the <unk>  what can you <unk>
This leads to a <unk> <unk>  <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the mind to <unk> the body of the mind.
From all the <unk> that I've ever <unk> with <unk>  <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> of the <unk>  who ever <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  in the <unk> of the <unk>
And they <unk> back into a <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> above the <unk> <unk>
In a <unk> <unk> <unk>  was only <unk> this <unk> never <unk> by the <unk>
<unk> they become <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>  but the <unk> to <unk> is pretty <unk>
And the young <unk> are <unk> with their <unk>  if they're three or four or four are.
They are <unk> in a world of <unk>  in <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Two <unk> of nine years,  <unk> <unk> to <unk> the nine months of <unk>  that they <unk> in the <unk> of their <unk>
And now they are <unk> in the <unk> of the big <unk>
And this whole time,  they <unk> the <unk> values <unk>  values that <unk> the <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> <unk>  with the day they could go out and <unk> for the first time in life, if they're <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>  of the first <unk> as the <unk> the <unk> of the first <unk> as the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> You know? It's like I <unk>
So beautiful is the <unk> It's too <unk> to you this <unk>  They call themselves the older <unk>
I think we are the <unk> <unk>  who are responsible for the <unk> of the world.
And at this point it is very important.
If we think of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> we often get <unk> to  and the old <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  an idea that <unk> is <unk> in his <unk>
Or we <unk> <unk> and say that this <unk> is closer to the Earth than <unk>
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> by <unk>
For both of them is very little space in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> they have  by time and <unk> a <unk> of traditional <unk> of the Earth <unk>  which is not at the idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>  but in a lot of <unk>  the idea that can only <unk> because the human <unk> has only <unk>
What does that <unk>  It means that a little child from the <unk>  <unk> that <unk> with the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk>  who <unk> his <unk> will be <unk>  a fundamental relationship to the <unk> <unk> will be <unk>  a <unk> and a different relationship to the idea of <unk>  <unk> with the idea is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or it's the <unk> of a mind or a lot of <unk> is <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world.
I'm <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  with the idea that these <unk> were <unk> to be <unk>
That made me another human <unk>  than my friends of the <unk>  who believe that those <unk> are <unk> the <unk> of <unk>  and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>  and the <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the world.
These <unk> are important in their <unk>
And if you start with the idea --  that these <unk> can <unk> different <unk> to get your understanding  <unk> for some of their <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk>
It's a picture I <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
This is <unk>  the most powerful <unk> <unk>  from the <unk> of the <unk>
What <unk> so <unk> <unk>  is not just the <unk> <unk> <unk>  but how <unk> it is. It's <unk> from two <unk>
<unk> there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
If you just <unk> the <unk> <unk> it looks like a blue <unk> by your <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> with <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> powerful <unk>  <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> you ever seen the <unk>  if they're <unk> that <unk> <unk> of different types of <unk>  that also <unk> <unk>
That <unk> your <unk> in <unk>  This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> countries on a sea of <unk> <unk>  This <unk> no <unk> no <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
I was trying to <unk> my <unk> Richard <unk> <unk> --  a man who was <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  by <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I <unk> that these <unk> were not too <unk>  as <unk> because when the effect are <unk> <unk> <unk>  there is no one more home to <unk> the <unk>  <unk> are not <unk> in <unk>  because they are from their <unk> by a <unk>  in the human <unk> <unk> <unk>
They can only be <unk> with something  that the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is that the <unk> in the <unk>  the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>  How can this <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>  which is bigger than the <unk> of <unk>
We say <unk> <unk> and <unk>  that is <unk> <unk>
The <unk> say, <unk> plants are talking to <unk>  What does that <unk> the <unk> knows <unk> <unk> of <unk>  who can <unk> all the <unk> <unk> of <unk>  who can <unk> in our eyes as one kind of <unk>
If you ask their <unk> how they <unk> their <unk> to map their <unk> <unk> thought you something of <unk>
Do you know all <unk> I said, <unk>
And it turns out that you can hear all the <unk> species in a night at <unk> <unk>
You don't <unk> with <unk>  but it's a lot more <unk> than <unk> <unk>
Well,  The problem is that even those of us who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> them as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  but <unk> to a <unk> in history  while the real world, our world, <unk>
The truth is that the <unk> century over 300 years  not <unk> to <unk> his <unk>  or his <unk> <unk>  but rather if the <unk> that we <unk> in it, and <unk> <unk> or <unk> at <unk>  the <unk> <unk> <unk> of biological and cultural <unk>  on the planet. The problem is not <unk>
All the <unk> have always <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the problem.
The <unk> <unk> are not too <unk>  when they <unk> their <unk> and <unk> <unk>  just as a <unk> <unk> as that Americans are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not change or technology  that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> face of the <unk>
Where you <unk> in the world  you'll <unk> that it's not the <unk> of this <unk> to <unk>
These are <unk> living <unk>  <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> forces of their <unk>
Or this is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> and with the last generation in the <unk> <unk>  and now <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk>  to the <unk> <unk> where you can see that the <unk> itself with the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
to <unk> their <unk> with <unk> from the <unk>
In the case of the <unk>  the <unk> that <unk> his <unk> as a result of the <unk> of <unk>
Or if we go to the <unk> <unk>  where I <unk> a lot of <unk>  <unk> you see the <unk> face of political <unk>
<unk> the physical <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but <unk>  the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> is not just <unk>  but is <unk> in many areas even <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> as part of a <unk>
The pain of <unk> is not too <unk>  until you look at it <unk>
I <unk> with a young <unk> <unk> miles of <unk> <unk> in <unk> to <unk>
<unk> when I was in <unk> <unk>  <unk> I <unk> the face of the <unk>  where you're talking about <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The father of my <unk> was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
And then he was <unk> <unk> <unk>  when the Chinese <unk> <unk>
His <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
His mother was <unk>  because she was <unk>
He was <unk> the <unk> when he was two and he was <unk> under her <unk>  because they didn't <unk>
The <unk> that <unk> so <unk>  was in a <unk> <unk>
And one day they <unk> a <unk> <unk> on a <unk>  of <unk> For this <unk> -- she was seven years old, <unk>
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>  but the <unk> mind of the <unk> <unk> is something to <unk> you <unk>
And finally, it <unk> up to a <unk>
<unk> we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk>  whether we want to <unk> a <unk> world of <unk> <unk>
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> said to her <unk>  they <unk> that we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We would not only see the human <unk>  <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>  but we would also <unk>  and <unk> <unk> that there are other <unk>
We can feel <unk> with the idea that our species <unk>  <unk> is about <unk> years on Earth.
The <unk> <unk> that <unk> our <unk> <unk>  <unk> we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> -- and we <unk> a <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> -- and we had a <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>  found a year ago.
The modern industrial world,  is not another 300 years old.
And this <unk> gives me the idea of  that we have all the <unk> to all the <unk>  that will be <unk> on our <unk>
If the <unk> <unk> of the world  to <unk> the meaning of <unk> is <unk>  <unk> <unk> with 10,000 different <unk>
And it's in that <unk> that we're going to <unk> the ability to be what we <unk> a <unk> <unk>  that <unk> everything in the work <unk> to <unk> all the <unk> and all the <unk>  that <unk> can <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> of <unk>
This picture I was at the <unk> point of <unk> <unk> <unk>  when I was <unk> on <unk> <unk>
This man, <unk> told me a <unk> story of his <unk>
The <unk> government has not always been <unk>  for the <unk> In the <unk> they were <unk>  to <unk> our <unk> in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The family <unk> for his life and <unk> him all of his <unk> <unk>
And now you need to understand that the <unk> were not <unk> for the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of their <unk> were made by the fish in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> was not <unk> for the <unk> <unk>
He went to <unk> his <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in his <unk> When the <unk> started <unk>  <unk> he <unk> it as a <unk>
He brought a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>
When the <unk> was <unk> he <unk> a <unk>
He <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk>
From the <unk> he made a <unk>
He <unk> a dog in the <unk>  and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with nothing <unk> <unk>  And this is in a lot of <unk>  state for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> in the world.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the entire <unk> back from <unk>  a piece of country bigger than <unk> and <unk> <unk>  It's our new <unk> It's called <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> They <unk> all the <unk>
It's an <unk> example of how a <unk> <unk> <unk> to her people can <unk>
First of all, I think it's <unk>  I think it's <unk> for who is <unk> to <unk> this <unk> of the world is <unk>  that they actually not far away.
They're <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> of the human <unk> <unk> <unk> at the beginning of time. And for us <unk>  will <unk> the <unk> of these kids, as the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
What we eventually do with National <unk>  <unk> of the idea that <unk> never <unk>
We think that <unk> --  We think that a <unk> <unk> not <unk>  but we believe that stories can change the world,  <unk> we think that stories can change the world. Our <unk> is probably <unk> million times a <unk> <unk> million times a times a <unk>  we are in <unk> countries on <unk>  We find a <unk>
We make a <unk> of <unk>  <unk> to the <unk> with our <unk> <unk> to such cultural <unk>  <unk> where the <unk> is so <unk> <unk>  by what he <unk> so hope to <unk>  <unk> the most important <unk> is going to <unk>  that this world <unk> into the <unk> <unk> <unk>  that we can find a way to live in a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
where all the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some <unk> <unk> I <unk> a book <unk>
You might see <unk> with information from other <unk>
<unk> I'm also trying to explain some <unk> that you might have <unk>
I want to start with the <unk> <unk>
To be <unk>  the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> <unk> as a <unk>  To get the <unk> of our <unk> at the highest level of <unk>  we need to <unk> them as much individual <unk>
<unk> is <unk> a big <unk>  an <unk> part of the human <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> us in order to <unk> <unk> to <unk> to <unk> a higher <unk>  without <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> we find in <unk>
More <unk> in that people have more <unk>
And more <unk> means <unk>  more <unk>
This is so <unk> in our society  that no one would <unk> <unk>
And in our lives this <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'll give you some examples of our modern <unk>
This is my <unk> A <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> are in my <unk>  10 different <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> different <unk> <unk>
<unk> you can <unk> your own <unk>  for the case there between those <unk> species for you.
So that's the <unk> of my <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> you can choose  from this <unk>
You can <unk> <unk> million different systems of <unk>  <unk> with those <unk>
<unk> -- you have a lot of <unk>
<unk> another example --
When I was a young <unk> --  you could <unk> <unk> <unk> but only with <unk> <unk> <unk>
You <unk> it. You don't <unk> it.
That was the <unk> that it never <unk> the <unk> <unk>
That time is <unk>
<unk> there are a lot of different <unk>
<unk> at <unk> is the <unk> <unk>
These are the <unk> of the future.
My <unk> is the <unk> --  <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> do you have seen this model in the <unk>  but you can make sure that <unk> happens.
It <unk>  people come to the <unk> and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not too much.
<unk> in <unk> of life that are much more <unk> than the <unk> of <unk>  is these <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> -- it's not <unk> in the United States is not so  that you're going to go to the <unk> and you tell what to do.
No, you go to the <unk>  and she says, "We can do <unk> <unk> or we can do <unk>
<unk> has this <unk> and <unk>
<unk> has this <unk> and <unk> What do you want to <unk>
And you say, <unk> what <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> says, <unk> has this <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this <unk>
What do you want to <unk>
And you say, <unk> if you was me, what would you <unk>
And the <unk> says, <unk> I'm <unk>
And we call that <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
That sounds very <unk>  but it means that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk> of someone with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> things --  to a <unk> somebody who <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> and not the best <unk> has been <unk> to make <unk> --  the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  is <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Why <unk> if we can't <unk> them.
Because they think we <unk> the next <unk> our <unk> <unk> to ask for other <unk>
And our <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of our <unk>  is now <unk> to <unk>  as you can see on this <unk>
And our <unk> is <unk> of our <unk>
We find ourselves -- so often we want.
<unk> <unk> at the <unk>  you have to think what person you want to be <unk>
Let's talk about the <unk> <unk>
There has been a time that everybody else was <unk> from <unk>  that you <unk> as soon as possible.  and then <unk> as soon as we can <unk>
The only <unk> choice was with <unk>  not when and what you <unk>
Now almost everything is for <unk>
I <unk> particularly <unk> <unk> <unk>  I <unk> percent less <unk> than <unk>
They are not <unk>  or <unk> <unk> <unk>
No, they are <unk> with <unk>
<unk> I <unk> or <unk> I'm <unk>
Or will I do <unk> <unk> I first children, or a <unk>
These are <unk> questions.
They are going to have an answer to them --  <unk> if this means that they don't have all their <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> no good <unk>
And they <unk> They are important <unk>
And then we come up with <unk> <unk> just to  that technology <unk> us to <unk> every single <unk> of every day where the world is also --  except in the <unk> <unk>
There is <unk> one <unk>  I <unk> <unk> where <unk> is doing.
I don't want to <unk> because I want to keep that place for <unk>
But <unk> <unk>  <unk> at the time of work is <unk> in that we are <unk>  time time in <unk>  time we're going to work or not.
We can look at a <unk> of our <unk>  with our <unk> on one <unk> and our <unk> to the other <unk>  <unk> and <unk> our <unk> on <unk>
And even if they're all <unk> we <unk> every single <unk> of those <unk>  with all kinds of <unk>  <unk> I <unk> this <unk>
<unk> I <unk> on this <unk> <unk> I <unk> this <unk>
And even if the answer is <unk>  we <unk> the <unk> of our <unk>  in a very different way.
And what we look <unk>  the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  life is a question of <unk>
This is what the <unk> used to be <unk>
There were some <unk>  but not everything was a question of <unk>
And so the world looks like.
The question is <unk> Is this good or <unk>
The answer is:
And we all know what is good about  So I'm going to talk about what is <unk>
That huge <unk> has two <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
A very <unk> effect is that it has been more <unk> than <unk>
<unk> so much <unk>  people are <unk> to make a <unk>
Let me give you a very <unk> example of it,  a study of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> had access to <unk> <unk> of <unk>  a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They found that  for every 10 <unk> who <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 percent less <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because it <unk> to <unk> <unk>  so <unk> to choose  that people are just <unk>  to the next day, and that <unk> <unk>
And of <unk> is <unk>
That means not only that people <unk>  after their <unk> not to eat <unk> <unk>  because they don't have enough money <unk> <unk>  but also that the choice was so <unk>  that they have the <unk> for <unk>
<unk> they were <unk> to <unk> <unk> a year on their <unk>
The <unk> was willing to <unk> their own <unk>
<unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> can work.
And I think the world that <unk> <unk>
If it's about the <unk> you would like to make the right <unk> right?
You don't want to be <unk> with the wrong <unk> or even the wrong <unk>
That's the first <unk> The second effect is that we <unk> we <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> with the result of our <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk>  than we had <unk> <unk>
And there are reasons for <unk> to <unk>
One is that in a <unk> for example, from <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> that the choice was not perfectly <unk>
And you <unk> in a case for that another choice would be better
This <unk> <unk> makes you <unk> from your <unk>
And <unk> does <unk> to the <unk> of the choice you <unk>  even if it was a good <unk>
The more <unk> there are <unk> <unk> <unk> it's <unk> to have <unk>  of <unk> which <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
The second reason has <unk> with <unk>
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you can <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> you see <unk> <unk> <unk>  of all the <unk> that you <unk>
That makes that you're less <unk> with the <unk> you have <unk>
A <unk> for the <unk> <unk> under <unk> My <unk>
This is sort of the <unk> of this <unk>
This is on <unk> in the <unk>
They have a <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> No human <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Everybody in my <unk> in <unk> is the city of <unk>
I could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk>
And he is too <unk> for two weeks to the idea that he <unk> every day.
<unk> are going to <unk> of the <unk> that we have from our <unk>  even if we make a great <unk>
The more <unk> there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> to us as a <unk>
Another <unk>
This <unk> <unk> on a number of <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> and now for example,  and you don't have to <unk> things.
Another point is that you <unk> with every <unk>  other <unk>
And all that other has so his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> there is the <unk> of <unk>
I was <unk> in my <unk> to a new <unk>
I almost always <unk>
<unk> there was only one kind of <unk>  and that <unk> you <unk> It was incredibly <unk> <unk>  but if you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and often <unk> enough enough <unk> and <unk> <unk>  it was <unk>
And after years I went to the <unk> for a <unk>
I said, <unk> I want a <unk> this is my <unk>
And the <unk> said, <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
<unk> you <unk> or a <unk> <unk> you <unk> or <unk>
Do you <unk> a <unk> with <unk>
Do you <unk> something <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> And so he <unk>
I was <unk> And after a while I said, "I want to say, "I want the only <unk> that would be <unk>
He had no idea what <unk> that was that  and so I have an hour all kinds of possible <unk>
<unk> is <unk> I <unk> the <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had done it better I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To <unk> this <unk> I have a book <unk>
And the reason I didn't feel better --  with all this <unk> was that I started to expect to <unk> the <unk> of a good <unk>
I started without any <unk> because I was only one kind of <unk> <unk>
And it turned out that there was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I was <unk> but not <unk>
And so I <unk> my <unk> with my <unk>  and I asked me <unk>
The more <unk> people have <unk>  <unk> more <unk> they <unk>  about the <unk> of those <unk>
And that means that people are less <unk> with <unk>  even if the good <unk>
<unk> don't know.
Because in that case you didn't know what I'm talking about.
It's really about that.
<unk> was better when everything was <unk>
Because when everything was <unk>  could have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our modern society we can do as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  but the best thing we could ever <unk> is that something that is so good as we <unk>
<unk> we are <unk> <unk> <unk>  because our <unk> my <unk> are <unk>
The <unk> of happiness -- <unk> you all <unk> --  the <unk> of happiness is not too much <unk>
I want to ask -- just a <unk> <unk> --  that I'm <unk> with a woman  which is really <unk>
I didn't <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>
But with less <unk> <unk> has its good <unk>
<unk> <unk> When you get a bad <unk> <unk>  If there's only one kind of <unk>  you can <unk> why you're <unk>
The answer is in that case <unk>
The world is <unk> because you had no <unk>
But if there are hundreds of different <unk> <unk> and you <unk> a <unk> that turns out to <unk>  who is <unk>
The answer <unk> is just as <unk> That's as <unk> That's <unk>
You could have a better <unk>
With hundreds of different <unk>  you have no <unk> to <unk>
So if people take <unk>  even if the results of those <unk> <unk>  they're <unk> about their <unk>
And they <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> under the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> -- not the <unk> but it is a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk>  is that people have so <unk> have been so <unk> <unk>
And then if they try to <unk> themselves the <unk> <unk> they give themselves the <unk>
So the <unk> is that we're going to go <unk>  but our <unk> <unk>
<unk> a <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> that everybody is <unk>
But that's not.
It <unk> no <unk> that can choose is better than not can <unk> but <unk> doesn't <unk> that choice is more <unk>
There's a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
But I know that we have long long the point that <unk> <unk> us <unk>
Now there's a <unk> -- I'm almost ready --  a <unk> where we can keep us the best <unk>
The <unk> in <unk> countries comes from <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are a lot of places in the world,  where we have been talking about <unk>  where the problem is not too much <unk> is that there is too little <unk> but <unk> that there is too little <unk>
And the <unk> that I <unk> here is true for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
That is <unk> and <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> told you <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> not too <unk>
I say the same thing about these <unk> <unk> <unk> --  They don't help <unk> <unk>  they focus <unk>
They make our lives less <unk>
If a part of what people in our society is <unk> to make all those <unk>  was <unk> <unk> to countries where people could <unk> <unk>  would <unk> life <unk>
<unk> our life would be <unk>
That's what <unk> <unk>
Everybody is better <unk> by <unk> of <unk> -- not only poor people --  and it comes through the <unk> of <unk> that we <unk> with us.
And finally, this <unk> If you <unk> this <unk>  <unk> you will be <unk> as a <unk>  <unk> what did you know about it.
<unk> is possible in a <unk>
A <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> --  that was my first <unk>
But the longer I think about it,  <unk> I <unk> that this fish is <unk> <unk>
Because in fact, there is this to the <unk>  If you <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk>  you have no <unk> but <unk>
If you <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk>  you're <unk>
It leads to more <unk> and less <unk>
Everybody needs a <unk> <unk>
This is almost certainly too <unk> --  possible for the <unk> but certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is questions to <unk> <unk>  and, <unk>
Thank you for your <unk>
