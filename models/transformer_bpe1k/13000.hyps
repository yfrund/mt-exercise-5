And a year I show these two dia's to show that the police cap, which the past three million years of the size of the size of the United States of the United S, with 40-40 percent cromes.
But this is actually the real problem because it was the nice problem because it doesn't the disecting the dised.
The ice capita bit on the North Pole, in a certain the cape of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crack in the summer in the summer and cracks.
The next dia I shows is a decided of what the last 25 years is happened the last 25 years is happened to 25 years of what happened the last 25 years is happened to show.
The permaneny is clear in room.
And you see, it looks at dark from dark blue.
That's the year, the early time, the winter.
And it crack in the summer.
And the same permanence of ice, five years or older, is almost like blood, which is from the body, like the body.
In 25 years is the from this to this forwar.
And that's a problem because the free of the North party was the North party warms and there there a very big high--fred corn cool cool dom, when it was designed by microbes in meth.
And, with the total high-fieless in the atmosphere, that would be how to be double to the early clear as we can push the count of the eds.
In some understanding in Alaska born in Alaska born of the water.
And, the am winter went from Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another undiep of the University
Whoo! Well, OK. The question is that we will be be that are going to be that
A reason that is that this enormous Groenl," Groenl, Groenls from the north.
This is a smell smell right.
The water volum is echer than ever sit.
This is the Kangerlussuage, in South South South South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea currently because it country because it countries, it's the place in the sea place where it comes in the sea place where it in the sea of the sea currently comes in the sea cure of the sea fires of the sea capital where it is the sea of the sea piece of the sea piece melse.
This stroms take flight air.
And the other side of the planet, on the South polic, the biggest ice mass the biggest ice on Earth.
After the same maand reports scientists that the whole continent now is now a negative icnow is a negative either than the negative ice continue continue balance of scientists that the whole continent scientists that the whole continue balance.
More specific is the ice of the South police of the South police of the South pure of the South polics.
The whole continent is for six meters sea fail of solid.
In the Himalaya, the at two after size na biggest ice massa, there are now a few years ago, who were now a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population population population of that smell during that smell time.
In the Andes, this glassing the bron of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappeared, and then it took water.
In California was a fix percent of 40 percent in the snow page of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are nstigate.
This global dream dream to a dramatical stycup.
And the number of natural around the world is cited with an incredible and never seen the incredible of the world.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the past 30 years in the progresside.
This pattern is full inked.
If you look at the piece of a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton to CO2 again, every 24 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Kook to the east eye of the Stille Ocean from the Stille Ocean every single source of the Indian inside of the Indian inside of the Indian alculating of the Indian already of the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, name, name, which is the bread, which is the bread, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the most all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extincluding of the two largest of China.
And there was a prety more still cools.
But we see a crice.
These are the stone-cuty of the building was annuled in the last years, and where green are in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last years.
There's a political strips in our country.
The city-cool, and oil industributed for 250 million dollars to promots, which is a general calsal, which is a gene circulated, which is a gene of circutments.
And that imagine me to think about something thinking.
Rond the chure was the chure in Tennesse, at me in Tennesse, four billion liter city.
You have the probably in the news in the news of the news.
This is the one after one after a biggest falstrict in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertise of the city-basically the Kerstributed the Kerstice.
Video: "The break is the benefits a blice, opposed to chure out of the sky.
He's anywhere, in America, and he sare in America, and he she sare that our economy.
Frosty the city's still becoming with the day.
He's pay and cutable and works, and works, their bit."
Here is a big part of the cities, in West Virginia from the city's fia from the city.
The biggest mality of the country is the great bades of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship "Let me be clear to be clear be. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious for our business for our business.
That's why the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantic away to reclassion to the light on the light of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth city.
Feity, steal is not smare.
We find that it's showing -- and it was a showing --
So, you don't make a swer about climate change.
Let me only that we go.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about heard.
So let's take a look at these hypermodern modern coolcentral.
Fantastic! The machines are best wears best wear.
But that's the sound of sound sound sound technology.
And the despite the fact that it's burning of city-one of the most important war of the earth is change the real scue of the earth is change the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look around the same stome technology of frolly,
Al Gore: Eincease to the positive alternative at our economic challenges and that on the area of national security of national security of national safety of national safecessing the positive of national sector.
Video: Stem: America is the crisis, the economy, the national security national safty crisis.
The rod red red of these things is our dependence is our dependence of fossil fuels, like fuile collects and inported oil off.
But now there is a heading of the new solution to get here,
America of 100 percent scale county of 100 years.
A plan to get America to get America to get a plan that our safe of the Earth and the opwarming of the Earth case of the Earth case of the Earth case of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth corners.
And eventually, a solution that is the enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Onttthing.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about America resource.
One of the fast, to make a end of the dependence of olded either again, fithrough she fired our planet,

Stem: Repower America. Tich,
Al Gore: There's an old African speakes says, "If you want to be a quickly.
If you want to go away, again."
We need to go far far and fast.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I police back with a hice about how that machine works.
So I am here. For the ones that there were not the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment in the size of the subjectly experiment in the ometer.
It needs to the circumstances that were resource that were under a billion done second second to 600 million times a second second.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs based in detectors of the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters the ATLAS -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the scale.
On 10 september shape for the first time, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
And that she care in the control, in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle particle that is all the LHC around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, which is particles in the detector of the LHC, which is detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that photo 10 September kids that the machine works, which is a huge works, which is a huge depenormous deside
I don't know if this the biggest the biggest of the biggest of the biggest page, and then the internetpage.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this gold.
And that draws ago, 13 thousand amps when the machine on the full power.
The engineurs under you will said, "Not value. It's true. It's true.
They can do that because they can do that superature on the temperature temperature
So at min 271 grads, the space between the gars, that can the strongs, that can reason behaviors.
In one of the necks between the necks between thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And then the wire was something warmer, and there was a electrical wear, and there was a thousand amps that 13 thousand amps of amps that 13 thousand amps of the same thousand amps of the became something that was 13 thousand ample of the behored.
This was the results.
This is another indrugs when you realized that that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets more than 20 centimeter in the 30 centimeter were going to be 30 centimeter world in the same way.
We descadignited about 50 magnets.
We had to take them from half from half of them what we did.
We all have a true of them when we all have parated.
Now they're back on away.
Eind the LHC will be intact in the LHC weather intact.
We will go to measure it and we expect measure in you, or you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be what the buildings of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who have increase the debate of scientific research of scientific research of scientific ree research of science.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be a fact that we are going to be able to be the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was defently defently defently experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous Farday, this is so dangerous Faraday, this is so much of the human mind in the nature of the science, that we did in the nature in the nature, and we discovered the nature that our definite in the nature, and we dicame way, and dicame to memberatele."
Thank you very much.
I would start to ask with you with you to ask to your kids to your kiddle to your kiddle in your childhy-ax.
When you discovered how you to understand how to understand how to go to the decided to the learn of space problems by the decise of space relationships of space relationship.
Ruck calls is a strongly because with the understand of the world to understand of us to understand
If a information of inspired by the name of physical interaction with the name of physical interaction with my advisure Pattion and my medicer Jeeevantage -- I started to ask away to ask a computer -- what if we use a computer -- what we would use use a computer mmuses in a smushing fingers that we can informed a plate smush, we uned with a place with a place counds we can understand information with a place basick fusing fase came to a fingert of the informe cured fulatory flase fect of the informed with a fulating fultive base bilital fults.
and can we orders like we want?
This question of us so decided that we decided that we decided to look for the building of Siftables.
Cort a Sifty is a Sifty interactive computer in the size of a cookooks.
They can be able to the hand they can be each other, they can put them to each other, and they can put a screen and she rescue a screen and contact.
The character is the physical hands of block block of block they're going to understand by understand by understand by understand it.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
And then this hit helping helping a more physical difference in the movement, and even of each other, and even of the way we have to defigure them are different way we have to discover them to discover them to didiscovering new life interactions and learn interactions of the movements.
I will start with some simple simple examples.
This Siftis insted to show a video to show a video to show to show and others and others and others and others played on the back of the same time.
And these interactive portraits of each other scary awarens.
Indies to each other, they will will be each other for each other other other here.
If they are also remarkable, they can be able to be able to be able to be a lot of them.
And fither fellow and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of this interaction, the using of the interaction of the interactive of a small of a small of a small of a small of a small of a small of the interesting of the interesting of the interactive of the interesting of the interaction of the interesting of the interaction of the interactive of the interactive.
And in this example of the examps three Siftables of the resources in a leg, and I can use them to go into a leg, where they are being humans are being in a leg,
If we have government, we have some back.
There are some cappe of capitary possibilities for education, mathematics with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things to people the possibility to see things that we want to see things to see the result intain immediate.
Here I show this is the development of a Fibonacci result of a simple resulty programmmmate.
Here we show this is a play that a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a light legs on every Siftable, and case words in a words.
After about 30 seconds becomes is very 30 seconds, and different series of a new series of letters with burning possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am to try and there a video of it.
They were actually really, there were actually again.
And one of the most interesting things of this most interesting is that people almost people nearn't needn't needed instructions that people need.
Everything you need to say, "Make word" and they know what they need to do is do.
Here are some other people on the test.
That's our youngst basically basically rement.
Blase he shows the Siftables wish.
For him was just this bloces.
Here is a interactive paintingly showed
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonstrip.
He can take new karaker in the scene burning the Sifty with that carry of the table.
Here he shows the sun commity.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: No he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
God than! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the ship, of Siftables and the name places that can she can the characters the carakters with each other: We're going to show you --
DM: And his own story story of them story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open ended.
and he decide how it it it walks.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I will show I will show to show Is a synthesizer and live music put that we have evolved to every Siftables a sound product as the lead, based a sound and drum.
Eenious variations that you can build with variations, which you can use it to be able to use the same thing you want to use it.
And these sound sound in Siftables can be injected in the pattern so you can be the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the number of a legning Siftable of a legal effects like reason the reason of the reasasasses.
They are being a sound sound and sound by can.
And fither the general effects like tempo and fulum that are pattempo and follow pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: We're starting with a leaving place in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a first pattern by a extra extra lot of extra lead.
Now, I place the basic basline here.
Video: Do I feed what slaggular work.
Video: And now I can call the filter the filter of the drums, so I can influence the effect live on the effect of live on the drums.
Video: I can get it a celebrate by the cances of the tempo block of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: No you copple to the baas for what more expression.
Video: Me: I can repay patterer as it plays.
So I don't have anything to planns, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, the very longer and as I want.
With it was the dimmms of the following Sifty to the left Sifty to the left on the left so.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, from new people, and then interfaces that better interfaces that better better the way our brain and lights working better and work on the brain and work on the brain and work on the brain of the brain of new people.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of design area with some of earth, we are in the lab.
And the thought I want to talk about is that this is that this bad, is that this is a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information with digital media, which we wanted to go to our world as we wanted to do it.
I thank you from hear.
I look at it to talk to you with you all and talk to you with you with you and talk to you with you with you all and I look at the you to talk to you with you with you all and I look at it.
I am write write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My life lives long long for write and I don't think that ever will change that ever will change that ever will change
And yet is unless the longs in my life and career in my life and career with my work with my work on my work on with my work opens in my work on with my work and
And it started with a book that I have unled unless I written a memove, "Ex, Bible say, "Exce," that I have in the very world to my first work the world about the international experience world about the international excited to my first work on the world about the international expensive in the international expansi
And the shows is that people are now and always have to be a piece of the time.
Well, what -- really, you know, does --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you that this success: "Ben you don't never ever eventure?
Don't you see that you are going to be able to be able to be able to be a book more a book more a book more a book more a book that people will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a book more to be able to be able to be a book more of the bang that people are going to be
Ben you don't have any bang you can't be bang here?"
And, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Nature, that would be very much of that. But I remember that I was 20 years ago, I was a teently 20 years ago.
People said, "Ben you don't you that you never success?
Don't you bang for education, that you are going to subject through it.
And you don't think you are you that you live to this work on this work without that there is ever from the puple of your broken and that you will be able to the puin of your broken with your broken bitters of falen?"
Is in that strekkking.
And in the short comes my answer on that questions questions on here, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that gently called
All time.
But I also many other things bangly, you don't want to know that for all of it.
For sea cure example, and other entire things.
But what is write I ask myself the last time that that any froam where any from.
Is it rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational?
Is it logical that someone eight becomes to the work for the work for the work for the work for the work for their human on Earth are solid?
What is so basically creative processes that we make us to create the effects of the effects of the mindness of the mindness of the world.
Never you my father. He was skill engineer, and I can't remember that there he worked in the 40 years that he worked in the 40 years who was not a bang for the bang for a bang for way.
And so this is "Yohn, how is it with your chemist?"
No, no, there was not about it.
And in fact, to be failed to be engineuws have not the reputation of the reputation of the reputation pieces of manical depressive alcoholists.
Schricks, which have sort of reputation.
Not only anything write people have have the reputation of human being human beard human instability to be instability to be instable.
Look at the grims of the most magnificial doing the most magnifical creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many of stiers young, fail.
And even the ones that don't have a so-fiar placed, under their gave gave to be able to be a so.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of myself in the last interview."
That's a lot of what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of exciting this kind of looking at the same time.
We all have the earlier and have heard it with solid so.
The basically thought is that creativity is that creativity is including is that a poor and that a artist, and that a poor is going to real eventually to eventually the eventually eventually understand that is going to expensive the eventually easy.
And so I want to ask everyone here today, you can be with that idea of life that idea of life life?
Do you know, OK?
I think I think I went about it I think about it all the way I think about it all all the way to be a pretty though.
I think it again,
And also any dangerous.
I won't like this this this century this century.
We can creative spors a lot of better to live better either better to live better a lot of better better including to live better including to live better a lot of better including to live.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live in the situation.
Searly the fase where my career in my career now in my career now
Gike a one, you know, I'm young, amper a little year.
I can maybe I can four decade decade of decade
Hoogest probably will be anything I will have to be another publish the outside world as the world that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends, so I can do it in the sky: high high-bigh other, probably my biggest successed with me.
Jese, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, if you think it is the morning to the next hours to the next either hours to the drive either of the edits of the edits of the ods.
So I don't want to this.
I love love with the work that I love with the work where I love love of like I love love with the work of love.
And the question is: "Hoo?"
And after a long nam I think I can just come to the conclusion I can just by write a psychological screen in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of the process of the process of the process I think of a psychological scription in the process of inbuilding in the process of
I have to create a safe of the write of the resh of the myself and my government between myself and my response to the response to my future the response to my future the response to my future myself and my response to the response a safe of the future of the futures in my futures and my
I have the last year I sent to ways that to ways that to do that.
I am in the history and have done in the other societies to see or others maybe a better way to see or anothers have a better way to help creative people to try with emotional complications of creative process.
My search has birth brain the old Gries, and Romeins.
Let's just reflecture.
In the old of the old Gries, and Romeins believed that creativity was a stick of them self.
And I believed that creativity is a good party of a real, including a lot of place to the human right to the human reason the human reason of the corportunction.
The Great Great this needs, these needs.
Ook Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demp words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they heat them called a "genidend creative creative spirit of a genious.
The funch is that the Romeins with a genie without a genic purch a purch of characters
In their policy was a genial magical godness that are opped in the mure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists was working on the genius,
And it was work.
Brilliant! That's precise the earlier I had the first about the earlight, the psychological protect of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work ging.
The artist, in the artist, in the artist, for example.
If you work brilliant work there, you know, you don't all the ear.
Everybody knew that a unshows that a unshows you had heard holpics.
Well, you know, you work on work on you.
Everybody knew that you had a prety unity.
Lange time is that in the Westen creativity was creativity became the Westen creativity was being the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything was changed to change.
There was a very new idea: the individual humans is the middle of the universe, and miverse, and mysteries.
None space for mystical creatures from the godbags from the godbagal world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believy that creativity is full from the individual came from the individual
And for the first time, in history was about artists artists said that they were not a genius that they had a genius that they had a genius had.
I need to say that I have to say that a big faid.
And in one person one person, one person individual individual individual is the bron of the eystery, the bron of the euwer mystery, of everything is good particular mystery, of everything that is -- that's something that is to a lot of a fragiality for a fragial human psyche.
if you reason someone ask in the sun.
Egos are blazes to gigantial proportune and there are incredible high expectations of prestations of prestations and
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists a lot of artists has made a lot of artists.
And if it is, and I think that's what is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older the relationship of the relationship?
Maybe not.
Well, light 500 years rational housicial humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes
And probably sit in the audience people who have tributting true of the idea that either have been about the idea that either each of artists with some of artists in the work of artists to inspirators.
It doesn't look at me that I all you will get in that I will get you get in there.
And I ask it I went to me.
Why not?
Why would we have done that thought that thought that thought to the next of thought?
It was just as much as much as much as any other verage explanations of the totally decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something something has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, we don't always -- it was creative process -- it was creative process -- it doesn't always won't always again.
That sometimes the barea paranormmical true.
I have the great American dissible American dissible Ruth Stone Stone Stone
She is any in the next of the next she write them.
She told me about her jeught on the plattempt of Virginia.
Somes, if she was work on the work was working was a close she was a country.
It was, as as as as if there was a big wave wave to put a big wave air.
And so, the country to her the country to her her it.
She felt that the ground under her food and she did her foot that her her on that her her life on that her life.
And she went to househind by the close and they had to see so quickly as quickly, and paper and packs.
When the close was showed by her her shows was her only to write it on the swrite of the sks.
Sometimes she didn't squickly enough.
And then walk and ring and ring it doesn't reach the house
On moments school the close of school so, she saved a fired of the fired -- in her words -- in a different dicharter.
And then there were a little bit -- this find I think it -- this find the beautiful part of the story -- they almost mistic.
And then she was in house in search and paper and paper and piece of the close by her home.
Juise at that moment she had a picture.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me she was showed from the air.
She packed up with his start, and then it back in her body, and then it back in her body, as she written the opportune of the opportune of the sopher body,
In those case came out of the close that in solid in a singer, but then in the cored, but then in the corde.
When I heard that heard -- what I thought, I thought my creative process of creative process of my creative process of creative process of the creative process of that percent of the creative process of that heard that heard my creative process -- I thought that heard I thought, I thought, I thought that heard that heard I thought that heard I heard that
And this is my creative process process process process process of process process
I'm a mile, who every day on the same time, and I was the same time, and swer with blood and with blood and trans down the same time.
But even in that day I have a swoom I have a experience a experience.
You will also know it myself that you can know that there are creative ideas, that there are creative ideas, that you can see increative increative you can identify increative ideas.
What is that break?
How can we use it without without that we are being it without that we are being the same thout without without without that we are being the so.
One way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example, I can think is musicians musician.
A few years ago, I read him for a time, I was a magaze.
We had the here.
And in fact, in fact, a great part of his life life the showed of the amazing of the amazing artists that from all the power to get to the unbetter of the unbefore creative impact in him.
With the 190s was Tom what rise.
On a day he was in Los Angeles Angles over the fast, and changed the process of radical radical ry.
And as he did up there, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that fake, understand that fair, understand the bar,
It was a nice of the fasth. And he wanted to the fasth.
But it didn't walk.
He had no paper tor, no taperecorder at the table.
And the wonderful exciting again, "I read the melody called "I read the melody clear behind me the ewith.
I don't am enough, I can't do it.
He was not real panic, but he stopped that whole mentalal process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry heard I heard the behind I behind the pure of the slight and she said, "Sorry hear, you can't see the slight and she said, "Sorry hind the s
"Do you really think I can now a song of sone?
If you really want this song that this song later, you have to have a later, if I have time I have to you.
Nobody else -- someone else last.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from from that songling the process of the process of the process
The work itself is another thing that is the same means of the dark of the dark of the same thing is the same thing.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him in him in him in him a when he distance.
It was close to close the skin and leave it and leaved it for the sky.
And then realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through it.
It could also be a wonderful bal, bizarre samental work between Tom and the own and the own and the own diaspect that not all the Tom myself was not very much a Tom myself was not a wonderful of Tom myself was a w
That story has changed my way of work change.
I have a lot of any had a single of the heard.
I was middle in the write of Ets, Bible of Ets, Bible
And in a given moment in the wonderful I in want.
You know, you know, you know, you don't want to be a good and you think it is a terrible race of the bad book. It was just book a differently book.
Not simply bad bad bad bad bad bad of the bad
I wanted to figure out the project of the earth.
And then I remember Tom that I was a showed who did me who was a powed to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to his genius.
I wish me from my manuscript and I was a legning to me a legning of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know all know that if this book is not just book this book is not just a book through this book by me.
You can see I see everything I have in the stop I have in me.
And I can't give you a lot of that.
And if you find that it has to be better you, you have to do that.
Snap you don't you that, you don't you, you're not, you're not,
I just write do, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the noty away are of the basically am that is just a today on can.
Tjage -- Unity, the indecise here.
Euws ago, there was in the North African desert African desert to put at monits to do with the monlight on the sky music.
And then then hindition to the ochtends, to the ochtends.
That was amazing because the dances were full professionals.
But sometimes a very happened something happened something happened.
One of those dances was transcendent.
You know, you know, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever been doing with a performer.
It was as as as as as as a stape and the dance of a poor.
He didn't did anything else nights of nights of nights and now everything together.
Plotation he didn't longer a human bes.
In him, under him, burning him.
A good fired door,
If she was going to be able to do something that was Dan started to classing people in the class and in the class and in the clas, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
Woman, a fun factoris: Toen the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spance Spansible Spance Span.
The real real is real real real changed of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, one."
And that hear you today the day at the day and flamengodance.
If a artist, in Spance something impossibility, or magically do, "Allah, other, oone-od."
One of God. It's a show.
Precently what we need to have now.
Last, Last, that the dance the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to the next 11 hours not a good ladge more hours to the next more hours to the next morning more home hit to the next morning to the next
And in that moment is he going to come a little bad man with past, which is never that great least more to be more solights to be more sings.
Maybe there will never anyone more anybody God anybody in the dance.
What should he now have to be nowing now?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to real form for a creative mind.
But so pinded it doesn't have to be the be.
Imagine you don't get all of your except that the most incept of your person from your your your your your your your your your your your your your your myself.
Imagine you believe that you have a whiled to have a whiled of a didn't nather than a true bal.
When you get there with anyone else with someone else.
And so this is what anything.
I hands of the average that though.
And the last months I have a book that book that book is going to be different. The book is a lot of the book that many book a lot of reikhalf to is except in is exciting in is except to a book a book that much a book of the book of a book that I have a book to a book on a book of months that I have a lot of respong mon
The opportune of those illust.
And if my thought with me on the hall, I love me to hold me I stop the same before.
And then just you know, you just work.
Blise just you do this, which is also it is.
If it is to dance, go thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much a dance.
If the good engined, you know, you is decision to decide in your work on enil bron in your work on the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by the long"
Thank you not, thane anything that down.
And also then, "Oll!
I believe this hear.
"Olly, how you ever eye, because we from pure human love love of human love, and own own plooters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have a lot of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can meaning the human genome.
We started from a new point: we started a new point: we were the digital to the digital codes of the digital codes to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology and synthetimes, and synthetic of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of questions
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different levels on different level.
We have different benefits in the back of the bread, the back to minimal components.
We're now almost 20 years at the digital issue.
When we have sequence, the human genome ced, went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask anyway, or can we regenerate to regenerate new life of this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the small, in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can come to a nice smaller genome.
We can take in the order of hundred generate from the 500 or so that there are there are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is relatively relatively with the one.
Geleve, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all the genes that we can look at the lives of the lived celebrating that this would be a lived cell cell of life.
We decided to be the only route forward this chromosphere, to synthetic this chromospits so that we could have the components to be so that we could have the components to ask the fundamental questions to ask this chromove.
And so we started with questions with questions are we started a chromoshe's a chromos?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry that we never seen before we never seen earlier.
And, if we can do that, a chromosource?
A chromosophics but a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digital issue of life is resources of life is on exponential eatory
Our move to write the genetic coded to write the genetic slowly long, but is a lot of the genetic came to write the genetic code.
And our last point would it at this moment would places on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, city, to start with a bio-ethical true of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to DNA is very hard.
There are 1,000 might machines in the world that small pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you have more folits in the world that small be more fold.
So we had to make a new method for the society of these small pieces and the corrigate of all the fails.
And this was our first power, with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Suty Suty V.
That's a small virus bacteria death.
We design the pieces, did the foltcorrection.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spane part of the piece of chemical striple chemical stopped in the bacteria of the genetic code genetic code -- and viral particular despites and viral particular glasses.
The viral particles were cells when we were from the cells, they were from the cells, they were back and dead, the E.
I was speak with the oil industry, and I said that she said that she model that model they were fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger bigger bigger --
We wanted to full the full bacterial chromosope.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttty of viruses, so that we could call the cassettts.
And to go to understand what the deaths of a lived cell components of a live.
The design is crucial information and when you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are happens.
When we first first first time this genome society in 1995 was the standard of the standard of 10,000 baseparats.
And eventually, we found after 30 folates. If we had the original sequence 30 folatory sequence in stage at state sequence.
And part of the design is the design is the design of pieces that have to design over 50 letters of the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-b-sub-b-sub-b-sub-b-bits that we can design to design that we can design to design the design of the design that we can design to design the design
We design here unique here.
Maybe you read that we have water water right notics in stopps.
Beause this: we have a fourth genetic code: A, C, C,
Trios of those letters of those letters for ruwweight, 20 aminozure -- that there is a only unletterly clear aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words to write words
Actually, we just call the mircle of the corn.
Some were closed that there were no forward that there were no forward that there were no forward.
We have this pieces that we can design them to enzymesms.
There are enzyms they reparts and in each other and in each other and in each other and in each other and in each other and in each other.
And we started to make a pieces that five to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters long and you have a lot of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 72,00.
And in every city, we have a floced of these pieces so that we could sequences she sequences to create a process that will create a process that will be a process -- that will be strazy straight -- that will be straze.
We try to reach the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketbase.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 10,000 basepars -- more than 10,000 basepars -- they don't grow in E.
And this is the expensive of all modern tools of the modern of modern molecular biology.
And so we went to be the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe that "homologe recombination, that is used by the biology to reparers, that pieces can foot foot that she can foot food.
Here is a example of that.
There's a organism called Deinoccus rence that three million race million to stralize the can.
And that you see in the bottop of the panel, she would just clear the chromosphere.
12 object 24 hours later, he was the again, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
And these organisms can full opportune.
They can life in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can be able to space in space that can imagine in space of the space of aquatic ent.
NASA has been show that there is a lot of is, there.
Here's a design micropphone of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- factly with these processes -- factly gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design where we did them in the right design of the molecule of the molecule of the molecule of the molecule
Givers is that they automatically society of the automatically
This is not an electronen-microscopphere. This is a is a microscope.
It's such a big big, molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we unlight undred to the inside of the inside of the publish.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of people, with a clear structure.
The molecuulght is more than 300 million of 300 million of
If we would be able to put it with a 10-points letter, without of spations, without of the neetic codes to pression.
Good, how do we started a chromos? How do we active.
With a virus is the clear avairly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of inororder.
It's also simple if you put it under eukaryots, as you know, you whether you walk the cell of the cell of the cell of you and that's what you know as the cell of you know, and that's what you know.
And the bacteria is the chromospling in the cell of the cell in the cell of the cell transpllanguage of a chromossion of a chromosside of a chromosource, and it can active.
We have a chromosophim of a microbsed of a microbs.
These are about each other so far of each other as people and mice as people and mice.
We figure out what extra genes so that we could have to be a chromosophim to be selects.
We have the true of enzyms to make all the eive.
It was free bsational when we put this in the cell of the cell -- and you will be the very size graphical images in the cell pictures -- the new chromosource.
We even thought he would come to show it would come to be able to develop the process of the process of developing process to develop the process of ear.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of kinds of that are a second chromosources in a third of third general she thousands of own own in one times in one times of the species.
People who have evolution evolution evolution as as as as as as as as as a lot of biology community.
There are enzyms who are restrictims are named to be real DNA real realized that realized real restrictions.
The chromosophicians has not eed.
The cell -- the chromossion -- well, we put in -- well, well.
It was expensive the other chromosources as a strange as a strange of material, and it was a why we had to be eventually a cell with the new chromosonly with the new chromoss.
He was blue from the genes that we had in the genes that we had stop.
And in a very short time all the corn of the software of the one of the kind of the kind of the kind of completely in the new kind of based in the new kind of software in the cell that we had stope.
All the either changed the genetic codes -- when we changed the genetic code was precise in which was changed.
This may be clinking as genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the state, by the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things
Good, I have a little based that this is not a sketly -- this is not a skept on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have better that we maybe a new version of the Cambury of the Cambury of the Cambury of the Cambased on this new kind of designs in this digital design.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's free the free is the free if you look at what there.
We're going to take a huge of six-half to the next to 9940 years.
And in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now people on this planeets.
every of us that in 1946; in 1946; biness that there are four are going to be four are.
We have to have to have a food with water, with the ssistance, medicine, burbing the six-half billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion of billion of water, with the she's food, with the food, with the six-half billion billion on billion billion billion of water, with the burbillion water, with the sessix-half billion water, billion water, with water,
And that's becomes to do.
We use five billion cols, more than 30 billion billion billion of oil
That's 100 milos fessing a day.
When we have biological process in eysmally, or whether to take that we have a huge challenge to be a huge challenges.
And then of course, of course, there are all those carbon the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere.
And though our worldwithout of our world's discovered now a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had a strie different components, but a down different components, and look at the diversity that is community.
We're pretty again, by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now now have technique she fast, called the combinatic called the combination.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes think, or try different genes think, or try to optimalizing processes to make octanize the vaccines, we can do with a small of team in a small of team biology biology biology biology biology than in the last 20 years,
And it's just standard standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard.
We can select selecters for life burness, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccined,
This is a scree of what real designs that we work on work, so you can actually do to work on the computer, so you can actually go on the computer.
We don't know how it will see how it will see here.
We know how their genetic code of the genetic code.
We now now now at fourth generation of fuel cles.
Onlanguage, you have seen to ethanol you know, a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third fuel that are burn generation will come from coming from the burer, to more high high burer fuel like sugar burn or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food price without the food price without the food price and the described is as we start with CO2 as his food and his food and designs with CO2 as his food designs that we think we are the first showed the first sources in the first shows of the first generation that we have been farea fired to have 18 money firee mage.
And sonce and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwithout of our worldwithout of the global discovered all of the global methods of other methods of the global methods --
This is an organism that we have described in 196.
It lives in the deep sea five of a five pieces in the deep of the skilometers.
It makes methane of CO2 with tree of molecular water stributtty water as energy source.
We are looking at the ice of CO2 we can take a fired via pipate fabried to fabries, where CO2 are CO2 is becoming back to brand this process to bring this process to five this process to stribut, to sture this process to five this process to far this process to far this process to fabried to fabries, and we can be fabout, and fabried to fabrieve this to fabries, to fability to branding this process this process to fabored, to fabord to fabrieve to faive this process this process this process this to fabrievietriv
So in a short time, we think we are thinking that we are in a state of basal question question question question question question question of the basal question is that we are in a shorts.
We have actually actually actually have the piece of the pure of the pure industry to replace the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED can do this, where there?
A major energy bron be.
But we also now we also use this works, of these works, to think of these works.
This year was the fline of the flopen always behind the facts of the right on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change of teform combined vaccined.
Here you see how the future of evolutional boom now is going to change the evolutional boom now is the destributty bacteria and eventually bacteria and eventually eukaryota.
We're another far away of humans.
Our goal is very standing that we make a chance that we make a chance to survive. Thank you to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we are at a new technology that we are at Microsoft to Microsoft is about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can work or on the immense of the immense of fishing fishing data can work on it.
We look at many of this agains herhere, and we can culate here, and we can call the way on the bags on the bags and the sort of the sort of terms and the sort of terrible and the sort of the wish.
And it doesn't make how much information we look at this collections of these collections of these collections are of these collections are of information.
Most of his normal camera photographs, but this is a photographs, but this is a show of the Library or Conongress, and she was in 300 megapixel camera photograph.
It makes not all the prestations because it would move to move again, in a third system, the amount of the screen system, the amount of py-screen in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a example of nothing that I think that it is that.
This is a graue by Dicks. Every collabor is a head-piece of a heads.
And to educate that it's actually actually actually text to do that it is actually to do something that this is really text to show that this is not a picture of this is not imagine.
Maybe this is a small of a book way to read a ebook a book ebook a ebook a ebook
I won't mean.
This is a realistic, example. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular particular part.
This gives you the place and the experience of a real paper age paper or capital medium is actually a scaling medium is a scaling medium medium.
We also have done with the core of the Guardian.
We have a nett advertist of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertise -- and we have extra extra information information information --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas, there can really be able to be the limits of hands of them can do the screen of them can do the screen of them can do the screen.
We don't hope that this is not pop-ups more means and other third flauwekure.
Nature, of course, a for the hand for the gene of a technology as depicture, I will not speak here at the time, except that we can also much a lot of that we can also much a lot of the same time.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
the picture, on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is a showing on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer-vision by Noah Snah Snavely, promoved by Seity's University of Washington, inincluding U.Washington,
And Rick Smseliski at Microsoft Research.
So this is made a Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we see this is what we see this this, that we see through the images and the multi-devars.
The space of the pick of the images here.
The computer-visial mes have this pictures have been brain, so that they have been coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are ements of stabilish, and all these things are space space space space with space space space of the space of the space of the panorts.
I don't know if there is another time there, other environments environs.
There are there are a lot of space are lots of space.
I want to like to show a Noh's sets -- and this is from a sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth synth that we were working this summmer -- to communicate what I was in my head in my head of this techniques in my head of the environments on our website.
We had to love with the advocate enters and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Deay-flickr. You seech a Notre Deasy in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the pickr.
And every of these orange chairly pictures that part of this model of this model of this model of this model
And so his all Flickr pickr pickr pickr picture,
And we can took on simply education.
Well, I never thought I never thought I ever thought I would work at Microsoft that I ever thought I never thought I never thought I would have ever work.
It's the design here is so design here to be here.
I believe you that this many types are many types are cameras, you can see that this many of girl, a big number of this, a big number of these environment.
I will try to find some pictures.
There are so many capities by face faces and this.
Anywhere this is even a series of photographs -- here's a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daame that is also good chaincluding is by the program.
If we four, in a picture in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do with the social environment. This uses now the data of everyone -- of the data -- of the data of hours in the show, the Aarth -- and buy it looks at each other.
And all these picture, with each other one of the particular of the particular of the particular of the parts.
You have a model that from the Earth.
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work with the Virtual Aarde.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use, and which is the benefits of the present of people who are using it.
Their own photographs are being metaphor-data that somebody else in the same inful.
If someone would like this him and their names and their names and their names and their names and their names, my photograph, and I can use it with all that data, and I can use it as a gang as a gang that metaphor, using mettaphor, using the metaphor, using a photographs, and creating a kind of crace cruise of crace crue of cruision of crace, and crace of the crite of the crue of the data, and I would like to be corportun, and creature of the toolers of the photograph of the capach of the sp
And of course, is the bice product here, a imments of a imments of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from the air, who only didn't only from aircle of the airculture, but also from the collective getting the collective getting business of the collective memory of the collective getting of the interesting of the satell of the immentation of the collecture.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I started to start that what your software possible in the next years, in the next years, in the next years, all the picture, in the world can buy on the world can buy on the world can buy on the world can buy on the next years,
BAA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovered.
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it doesn't does on the data in the imagins.
And that designed when you think about the eyalth when you think about the eyalth of semantic information of these imaginformation of these images.
When you look at the web looks at the web looking at imagine a search of the picture, and the text on the webpage, and the text of what the imagina lot of information about what the image of the imagine of the imagina fat the web ble of information about what the imagine is figures, and the tedition the web and the picture, you see the picture, and the bread, and the picture,
What if now that you can pick on the image is on your imagine?
And then the number of semantic semantic semantic connectic connectic of the classic networks, and it's a classic network--network-network-effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredibly age.
One of the intense places of each and of each other, the possibility to live between them who are the old of the old off, who are not put their past, who are still their past, the antial planbs in by regarbits in the bits of planbits, the profably planbs.
The science that Jaguars are still reventure in the Melkay, or that the myths of Inter-eds, or that the myths of Invaian inside the Himalaya boodge boodhistill in the Himalaya breath, remember of Dharm, you remember in a same in, in which we are not lived in a courain, but the world in a barea boods, in a couldn't have a shower deep of the cority of the show.
And it sequences of a set of set choices that are our ancestors that our ancestors are corporated.

So it can't be surprise that we are all of the things and art art and art art art and art art art that we have all of the art and art you have all of the art and art them.

Well, light you can see this model in the wink in the wink of his face that happens that happens that happens that happens that happens.
And the follow: people come to the wink and assumption this question.
And you know how the answer on that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question.
No no.
It's not possible a possible that don't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are many important than the same of spular of spular spular is this explosive engineering choices of choices that are a factory of choices that many of spulated.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States that you need to the doctor, and you told what you need to do it.
No, you go to the doctor, and you know, we can do that, "We're doing that, or we can do that.
One has this forward this forward and name.
There is this forward this forwar?"
And you says, "Doks, what you find do?"
And the doctor, "And, this forward this forward and true this form and true this forward.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you know, if you were you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And that call we call "Done's a break of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, the sware tasking of decision of decision of the decision -- the doctory of the same -- the doctor, someone who has showed to a square disease to decil decide -- the patient. Vircults. Very has been a lot of course capability to receive rectool.
Good descened, you know, the down that ners: I think the down group, you can't buy it.
Why do we make it buy them, if we can't buy they?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other marketting to ask that other markable.
Our identity, again, yet a design of us is now on the best, is now on this dia slide.
Our identity of our blos of our behind of our behind
We find ourselves from -- so often we just wanted to do ourselves.
And every oches at the oppossible of what you want.
Let's talk about the simply of the sky.
There is a time that freedom that freedomatically from that went from that went out of that you were so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly to kids started to kids started to kids started to kids started to kids started to kids started to kids started to
The only real choice was with wish, and what you did and what you did do.
Now all the freedoms for the opportune for the opports.
I give you a break intelligent students, which I developed a percent less house.
they don't have the one of the same time.
No, they have the drug with choices with choices.
"Well, I now?
Or I will I have a real wait? Neam I first first first children, or a career or a career right?
These are all sverss.
And they are going to have a answer to them, as this means that they don't have all their househome work and there'd be a good currents.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave at that technology is that technology to be able to work every minute every day -- where in the world -- also in the world -- in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place place, which I mean, where WiFi the go.
I don't coulp that I want to keep place for me.
But good, that enormous choice choice of work in that we are going to be able to ask us on the time, or we are going to work on not.
We can look at a footbalaxy of our son son the one can, with our cell side, and our Blackberry at the other side, and our Blackberry at school.
And even if they all reason they're all of the aver, every minutes of those again, every minute, "Well, I ask this phone of the count?
So I went on this emailts, right? Well, I write this swrite write write of this emailty?
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we e" the food balaxy of our son a very different way.
What we look at it of the big -- the smally, materialist of life, life is life is a question of choose.
And so the world there is early the world there.
There were a choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world there's now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of bad or bad or bad of bad or bad this good or bad this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of bad or bad this good or bad this is now.
And the answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about it, so I go to talk about what is bad about it.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects on the human
A very basically effect is that the first lample is that the first lample of the free is that the first lam.
With so many choices like people to find the last, people to make a choice choice.
I give you a very dramatical example of investigured to investments in front of investments planns.
A collegs of me cral access to investing investing from Vanguard, a big policy of Vanguard, a big policy with about 2,000 million works,
And they discovered that for every 10 percent founds that the work-founds, the particular depensive two percent of the decision of the works,
Do fify found fundred to have a 10 percent less works, without of five five found five five found five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five found fundred five five found five five five found five f
Because it at fify found is so last, and that people are just to choice that people are just the choice to the next da, and that they were down to the next da, and so forth.
And of extincluding again.
And that means not just that people after their pensionate in their pensionate simply because they don't have enough money because they have been showed to have the choice that they have been so lasted to have the work of the work-sionate for them.
And they song with she showed 5,000 dollars a year at their neus for a year to their neus for a year on the neus for 5,000 dollars a year of the neus year.
The work-far was namely to reach their own bile of their own bviously referents.
To many choice can work on a losed work.
And I think the world there is so from there.
If it to be the century to do the right choice choice makes a very big, right?
You don't want to be opportunity, with the wrong found, or even the wrong found, or even the wrong th,
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the losing of us that we had the losing of us and choose to the result less teach the result of the result of the result of the result less options like we had less options to have less options of the result of us would have had a less options of options in the last time we had had the l
And there are figure reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, basically example, basically sings, back the choice can be perfect perfect was not perfectly perfect.
You state in a case for that another choice would be better better better would be better better.
This dreamed alternative solid for that you get to be able to be able to be a choice.
And then does down to the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you have a good choice way.
And the more options of the easy there are easier to have the speeasy of unaverses eight every easy of the cooks.
One second reason with substitution.
And then Gilbert from the morning of the true of things we depended the value of the things we depended them on the things we are similar them.
If you can alternative many alternative also fast, you can already the attract of all the alternations that you can imagine your education.
That makes you have less teaths of the alternative that you have cosozen you have a coso.
A example. For the New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example.
This is on the shot in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second win.
They sit on a beautiful strand. Straling again. Go mese.
Don't you anyth? "Fordik" thinks that man, "It's aughtype of the augh.
Everybody in my neighbors in Manhattan is the city.
I would would my carry for the destribut."
And he sit is two weeks to simmes, with the idea that he day again, a great parking place of a great place of place faile.
Substitutic cost of the fold of the fold that we have from our choice choices we have a great choices
And the more possibilities are more implace alternative.
And those presents, and that experience to us as substitution.
Now, a example.
This pictures that you are coming on a number of points.
Like in the here and now here and now you need to do things about it.
And a point is you with every choices of the choices out.
And all that other has been so his attract cans, which the coshows that the cosolid every easy less attract to be a less attract with the cosolid of that other has been so much less the corporattract that other has been so much less the basically cances, which is the coses.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came up with this is the broed, to my search broed.
I always always always speaks.
Because it was only one of the speed, and you know, you know, you know, the bought of you know, the past, the past, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the broed, and failed enough and fail enough and every long enough and early the right?
After years I went to the wink for a new way.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a speek, this is my makes my makes my makes my mak."
And the deal said, "Wilt you smart smart or fit or relaxed fit?
While you have a rhy? Whilt you stone-wasn't you stone-washed?
Do you a broek with slude sist effect?
Wilt you something expensive pice, or flink on the last pick pipate." And he went down.
I was speak from that. No a while, I want to said, "I want to be the only broed.
He had no idea that broed, and so I have a hours, and I have a hours to passes.
And, I show the wink is a wink of the wink with a broed.
I had better the better of those possibilities that could be better better better better better.
But I don't feel better that.
Why? Because this on myself from myself from myself.
And the reason I didn't feel better free with all of those choice was that I started to expect more of the speedity,
I started without without any expectly one of the speed.
And then it turned that there were different of there and one of it would be a perfect perfect
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a broek with my broed, and that state me that state me that stelebrate.
And the more possibilities of people have have expectations about the distances of those possibilities.
And that means people less teaths are less teach results are with results are good results are good results are good results with results.
Marketing people know this is not know.
Because in that case, you don't know where I have now talk about now.
And in really it's about about it.
All was better when everything was better way.
Because when everything was bad people have experienced people pretty surprising experience.
In our modern society can we reach as well-various burgers expection to expection is that we can reach it is so good as we can reach it as we can reach it as we had to be expected as we could reach to be expected as a well.
Never we are surprising to be surprise, because our expections are expectly high-high high o.
It was the secry of happiness -- this is the secrently -- the secry of happiness is not to expect a lot of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to be a carbon a carbon -- that I am -- I am with a woman who actually actually actually fantastic is a fantastic is a wonderful basically.
I didn't have a less tead.
But with less enough the good cans.
And finally, you know, when you take a bad simultic bager bakes as a salk coal is a bad of a bad and why you can be unted.
The answer is simply simple in that case.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you can be a bit turns out to fall the break of the who is responsibility?
The answer is just as simple is so simple of simple right.
And she could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks have no excusing to fail.
So if people decision of those who decision of those decision of those decision of those who are good again.
And they take itself themselves.
In the western samenled sounds of the left of the soundary of the younger generations high high-high generations
A factor -- not the enious factor, but a significant factor, in this explosive toward of depression of depression of depression of the same experiences of their high-experience.
And if they try that teleure themselves themselves themselves themselves themselves.
So the netoresultainly is that we objective in the objective of the objective.
Another a society of the society.
This is the official dogma, which is that by everybody to where becomes is a bit of where becomes
But that's not the so.
It is not a devely that can be better better is not better than not careffort automatically that is more more choice better is more choice better is more better is.
There's a magical grounds. Well, I don't know that I don't know that.
But I know that we have a long for the point that choice is that choice is being using us.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost a principle -- a principle where we can keep us best to be the best of the best of the best of that.
The choice in industrialized countries from material countries from material go.
There are many places on the world, we have earlier, where the problem is not so much a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice is is that there is a lot of places on the world.
And the paradox I speak here with name for the moderneed, wish for the moderneeds,
That's frustrated, and that's told here: Steve Levitt you have told that does are told and resources kids not helping kids to installow.
I say the same thing, you know, I went to this three, include choices -- they don't help it anyway. Erger right.
They make us live us live.
If a part of what people in our society in stage to make all those choices to make all those choices to have a countries of those people have to have the lived on that people have to go on the off.
And our life would be able to be on the other.
That's what economists a Pareto-improve.
Everybody is better awing awrite -- not just poor people -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have with using us.
And then finally, if you read this picture, you know, if you read this picture, as a developed ments, "Ach, what does you know, what?
Nthing is possible in a fis."
A wral imagine, a shortist world's imagined, I was my first interpretation.
But how longer I talk about this fish I started to better this fish, I was decided that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the brarain, if you go to create the brain to create possibility, but long, you don't have freedom.
If you get the visibilities to create possibilities to create less the fish.
It leads to more lost to more lost teving.
Everybody has a vision to call of it.
This is freedom, very single for the fish, but even for the fish, but for us.
But the decept of a figure, fishing is asking to ask to ask calize corn, unity.
Thank you for your your attention.
