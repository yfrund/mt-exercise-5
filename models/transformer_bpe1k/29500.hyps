And I showed this two slide of the U.S. to show that the polar cap, which was about the last three million years, about the size of the size of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this disability of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disectory of the ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a acceed version of what happens in the last 25 years of happened.
The permanent ice, dressed in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blue.
That's the yearal ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or older is almost like blood, is almost like five years or parently here.
In 25 years is the from this to this is going to this way.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern Icelebrate and there's a very large amount and there's a very large amount of free carbon methan, when it is death, when it is designed by microbe,
Comput the total amount of the total amount of the atmosphere, would double how much as we discribe if we write it to describe point to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe that if we discribe to describe that if we write the amount of the atmosphere, if we distri

Whoo! She's OK. The question is real to be faile.
An saving a reason that this enormous warm-follow warm-sources from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of that.
This is a smell aterriver --
The water volume is bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuadicately in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal because the landics are country to me, this is the place where it comes in the sea of the sea legal comes in the sea of the sea legal is coming in the sea legal is coming in the sea legal to know how the sea leader.
These streams, take these pities to reach away
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the largest ice mass the largest ice on Earth.
Around the primary month reports that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
Meer specific is the ice of the ice of the South Pole, very quickly on the melty of the smelt of any any underwater islands.
The whole continent is for six meters of six feet of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after largest ice mass, there are now new now that were now going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that smelt of that smelt time.
In the Andes, this glass is this glass of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it disappears to the drinkwater.
In California was a reduce of 40 percent in California of the Sierra.
It's coming in the water reservoires.
And as you could read it, are the predictions of it --
This global dressed dreamatic dreamatic stycle of forests.
And the number of nature, of course, is subject with an incredible and never seed.
Four more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the past 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what's happened.
In the last five years we've got 70 million tons of CO2 ag, 24 hours --
25 miles tons of the Stille area of the Stille area of the Stille area of the Stille Ocean, from America, west, and at every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic driflock of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, nast, nast, nail for 20 percent is fired for fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and voice is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extension of the two largest extension with China.
And there was a presentally to build much more urban central centers.
But we see a current.
These are the voice carbon countrales that the building was annuled in the last years, and green alternatives were pretty green alternatives were represented to
There's a political state, on the country.
The step carbon and oil industry for 250 million dollars for 250 million dollars to promote carbon of clean.
And that picture to something think.
And Rond the churst, at me in Tennessee, at me in Tennessee, four billion gallon model move for.
You probably have seen the news of the news.
This is the one after a biggest distripe in America.
This happened around the Curst.
One of the advertising carbon the Stone cool was thing.
Video: "Frosty the cool man is a blank man is a carbon man is a blanks.
He's a confluence of the America, and he makes it makes our economy grows on the economy.
Frosty the cool man is being with the day of the cool charge.
He's pay and cutable and cutile and worket their job."
Here's a big part of the voice part of the cool in West Virginia from the cup.
The largest mine work of the country is the big baship of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate protection of touching touch.
This is a piece of a bit from a bit of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatence for our things.
That's the reason why it's our important goal is to give a major refrace to give a major refrigors to the light and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the truth and the reason the truth
Fit is, steal is not smart.
We think it's clean -- and it still -- and it still cook.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me just that to us over.
Video: Acteur: Schone carbon about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cuptral.
Fantastic! The machines are making a little law.
But that's the sound of sound clean cool technology.
Actually, the fact that burn burn of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth, changes the remarkable of the emarkable of the emarkage of the remarkable of all of here.
Look good around, this is the clean carbon today.
Al Gore: Einquired the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges to the area of national security of national security
Video: America is in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The red wire crape of these things is our dependence of fossil fuels, like polluted oil coals, like politics.
But now there is a durful, new solution to get this.
Because America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan America plan America to work on the work of the Earth is a plan that makes us and the opposition of the Earth opposition of the Earth of the earth of the earth of the countern.
Eventually a solution that is a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last one.

One of the fastest ways to make a end, to make a end, of old fired fuel of old fires that our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help them.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, san, a new energy system.
And so with 2: New investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African talk about that says, "If you want to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be a fast.
If you want to go to and go to and go to them."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you.
And I went to give an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to get back with a hope about how that works.
So here, I am here. For those who were not going to be the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever supply underneath in the country to be ever in the case of the ones that are in commity.
It has to be the circumstances that were present less than a billion a billion time, less than a billion times a second none.
Enorm ambitious, this,
This is the machine under Gengine.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs in detectors of those mini-Bangs in detectors of the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular pectacular photograph of ATLAS in contacular and you can see the scale.
At 10 september ber last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That carefully that for a party party in the controllecting room.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the LHC went around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the detector of the detector of the detector of the detector of the LHC went in the detector of the first particle of the LHC went in the detect of the first particles in the detect of the LHC went in the detect of the LHC photograph of the detectore of the LHCHCome of the detectterly pt pt pach of the first free of the first free of the first fular stread, and with a pief ctttttttribebestretribest fready of the detect of the detect of the detect of the
In other words, when we saw that picture picture that picture the machine works, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the largest of the most right and I got to Google and saw that the Internet page, and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold down.
And those before they were dragid 13 thousand amper resiling the machine on full power to full force
The engineers under you'll say, "Not that are too small be a small drass."
They can do that because they superformance they superfect on whole,
So at multiple 271 degrees that are drags between the stars, that can drags that drags behaviors can break between the global ages.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was the wire was something warmer, and there was a bunch of electrical weather against 13 thousand amper resources of the reason that was a reflect of the wire of that was something that was happening in the wire of the wire restance, and it was a suddenly against that was something that was happening in the pric weather to be that was a electrical restance to the free of that was a thousand amper restancounced that was something that they were saying,
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realize that magnes that magnes more than 20 tons of faile, and they were about 30 centimeters.
We dealing about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them to have them to be tool.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be again, the LHC again.
We will put it again, and we expect it again, and we expect to be able to go further to be able to go further to figure out what the building is the building of the universe.
Now, of course, have that unhappy to be unhappy to research the debate of scientific research. It's easy to research of scientific research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard is that we go further than ever going to be beyond beyond things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, during the devaded of his learning experiments of his teacherling, his teacherling was Michael Faraday, this said, "Nothing is so dangerous than nothing that we are saying our images of human mind that we have science, and that there are no reason that we have no completely in nature, and that we don't completely in the nature that we are completely world that there are no rediscover."
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask to ask to your childhood to your childhood time, when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to figure out how to understand and the consciously problems to learn with the teaching of the depended with and hanters of space relationships.
Ruimtely insight is a strong because with the understand the world to understand us.
If a information of information that I started by physical interaction with objects -- samples with objects -- sample with my advising Pattion and my felt Jee Kalanithi -- I started to asking -- what if we were a computer -- what if we were used to use a computer information as a kind of digital fingeren-ineering information that information to a plate flat a plate that we can figure out of a plate with a flature of information that we can fix us,
and can orders and as we want?
This question to this question that we decided to see a answer of Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftile interactive computer in the size of a cookies.
They can be able to be moved with the hand they can do them each other, they can detect a screen and they put a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trades can be locking they're moving by understanding to understand it.
Boventables are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
By that these resources are a more physical display are of their movement and even consciously of their movement and even this, and even of the way we have different new and functions of the way we have to discovered.
I will start with some simple examples of the simple examples.
This Sift: This Sifty to try to tell a video that are playing, which is playing, and othersness and others are playing to plays.
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And they are also place each other to each other.
If they are also noticed them to be able to be able to be able to be a and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to concerned this and they can be surrounded to be able to be surrounded to be able to certain to be certainly supply to be surrouncing this and they are reference.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realize that we algave that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting interaction, as it was a committing of the result of a color was a fluid of a color was a fluid of a color or or a fluid of the interesting of the fluid of the interesting of the interesting of all of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interest
In this example three Siftables for three Siftables and I can use them to get color in a leg to enjoy color in a failed.
And if we have three we go, we go back.
There are some clear cupe of education, mathematics of education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people to spend the possibility and fast, and the result of them to see things fast.
Here, I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmmative.
Here's a game between a game a cross-between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every Siftable, you get to every Siftable, and dreamed the words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is really rescared to rescribe and seems a new series of letters with means of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I have to put them out and I put it out to make it out of a video and make a video of it.
They were really away from that.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost no instructions that people nearly needs to have almost no instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make word," and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people to test.
That's our younggood basically trip.
And it seems that he just seems the Siftables of wish.
For him were just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting a interactive painting thing.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable to the Siftable of the table.
He sun, he comes to come up the sun coming up.
Video: The sun coming.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done any! Yeah! Yeah!
By of the scue of Siftables and the next to places to each other, he can leave the characters -- Video: would!
DM: and so his own story of them.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decision how it walks.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I will show that I will show that I will show that I will show that we have evolved recent to have evolved a sound produced, where a lead, bass and drum.
One has four different variations, where you can use your choose what you want.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected so that you can depick the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the attern of a leg Siftable live controllably effects as available effects like reverbal and filter.
They are to a sound and added ading and addicated by can.
And so, the general effects like tempo and computely that are pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: DM: We're starting with a light in two Siftables, to a lot of a lead.
Now I place the basline --
Video: Now I feed a little bit of a bit of work.
Video: That I couple the filter on the drum of the drum of the effect live live in the effect live in the effect of live in the drum of the drum of the drum of the drum of the drum of drum of live in the drum of live in the drum of drum of the drum of the drum of the drums,
Video: I can accelerate it all through the office of the tempo of the tempo blocks.
Video: Now I couple the filter, I think the filter,
Video: I can reart it pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to planning to plann, but I can improvise it all very longer and shorter like I want.
And with the end, the dims of the end, by the volume to show to do left Siftly to left soil.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make my passion to make new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better on the way our brain and work and work on the way our brain and work and work together.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of the possibilities that we developing on the developing of the developing of the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the attack is just a new generation to be a very new generation for interact with digital media that the information to our world like we wanted to leave the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to go out with you.
I'm writing
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I have to change all of writing and I don't think that ever will change that it will change it.
And yet there is unless it something in my life and careers in my life and career, which I had to see my relationship with my work.
And it started with a book that I wrote until I wrote a memoire: "Eten, Biddy, Biddy, that very expect to my first work and a very single work and international stater.
The consequence is that people are all over the who's all all the time, as if I was always put down all the time.
And what -- you know, does --
People come to me and ask me and ask you and ask you said, "Don't afraid you will never ever be ever ever ever equate?
Don't afraid you will still your entire life will write your entire life will just be a book publish where people will be heam for heavy to be heaving you?
Don't you get there?"
And you know, the dissed, you know.
Of course, that would be a very naturally I remember 20 years ago, I was when I was a teenage -- I was a teenager, when I wanted to be a teenage --
People said, "Don't you get that you never success is never going to be success?
Don't afraise, you know, you will go on through subject?
Don't afraid you do your life to work on this work without that there is something from and you will diever drop on the puin of your broken on the puin of your broken with your mouth failure?"
Something in that stretch.
In the short comes to my answer to the questions of this: "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called to be called
Always like that.
But I also much other things that are bangling for all of things that all of it down,
For sea for example, and other only things.
But I write write to write the last time that comes fear where that comes fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logic that somebody is to be afraid to be able to put the work for the work for their opinion on on earth of the earth?
What is so particular about creative processes that we make us to make the effects, to make the effects, something that is not happening in other kind of work.
Take my father. He was creating engineer, and I can't remember that there was no remember to be somebody to asked to be able to be afraid to him anybody on the field.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, it didn't be talking about it.
to be fair fair of engineers have engineers have not the reputation of the centuries, also they didn't have the reputation of manician-depression of manicians.
And what have the right now, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputation mental instable.
Look at the griming of the grimal death most magnificant creative minutes of the 20th century.
Many died, often by own own own own down.
And even those of those who don't have suicide played fix to be concerned to be concern.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a very bit about your life work.
But of this kind of except we don't look at any more.
We all heard it before and heard it with subjects.
The heart thought is that creativity is that creativity is that connected to be connected to suffering an artist, and that will lead to eventually connect to eventually connect to ever the same to be connected to be able to evity.
So I think everybody here today is a question here today: are you to live with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it doesn't find the whole doesn't have a prety thought.
I think it is the refright?
And also any of a dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century is that this century.
We can creative mind to make a lot better to live it.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, would be particular dangerous to live to the dark of dangerous.
Scure the fase where my careering now in my career.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper to get a year.
I can be work for four decade for four decade of work.
Heast, probably will be a whole I'm going to publish the outside world as the work that following on that extraordinary successful book.
We are with friends under each other, so I can fell you know you can full you know -- probably lightly my largest success behind me.
Jemby, which a sense of a bit of an idea!
If you go to think, you're going to be like to think of you know the morning to the nein and all the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me with the work I love with the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work where I love to love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love to love me
The question is, "H?"

I have seen the last year to ways to ways to ways do that.
I have been down in the history and have redepends in other societies to see if others have found a better way to see a better way to help creative people to help creative with the emotional complicative percent of the creative percent complicative process.
My search has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Grees, and Romein's time of believed people not believed that creativity was not a creativity of themselves.
And they believe that creativity was a good mind was a good spirit was a reason of a very, unknowledge place to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these beyond "demonstrativity "demonen."
And so, Socrates believed he had a demoon who had a demoon that he had a word him of put him in the words of influence that he had a demand
The Romeins had a kind of right now.
And they were called a called creative mind a genius,
The funny is that the Roman is that the Roman is not a particularly pended on a particular pendent of clearning of the person is not a particular pendent of the Roman is that the Roman is not a particular pendently pended with a genius,
In their policy was a kind of magic dival entity that are opped in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house,
If the artist, the artist, reading the genius,
And he was shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first before, the psychological protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artists was so in protect to be protecting to a lot of narcism.
If you put billiant down there, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Everybody knew that a knamely that you had hold genius.
Well, you know, you work down the work doesn't just just you.
Everybody knew that you have a rather independent genius.
Long time is that been considered to creativity was considered to be considered to be considered to considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change and changed it.
There's a very new idea: the individual human individual human is the individual and mysterions.
No room for mystical creatures, atteers from the godable.
That was the beginning of the rational house.
People believed that creativity of creativity was completely from the individual
And for the first time in history was about artists artists were saying that they were a genius, and not that they were a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I have to find a big wrong.
And to one person, one person, one single individual human being believe he or she she or she she was a break mystery of everything good mystery of everything good -- that is to far a lot of responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asking, the sun in sun the sun in sun of click.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high expectations of prestations to prestations of prestations of experience.
And I think this pression of the last 500 years many artists.
If that's so so so I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to an older the relationship between the relationship between human and creative mysterion?
Maybe not to do that.
Wellight we can 500 years rational humanism not unforged to make a 18 minutes for a 18 minutes of trial moments.
Probably are in the audiences of people who have reviewed scientific doubt about the idea that either than the idea that education of the work of artists with what put prider the work of artists to inspiring heights to inspiring heights to inspiring heights.
It doesn't seem to be able to get you all of you'll get to get you all this.
And I wonder it wonder it.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought that thought that you have thought of the mind?
It's just so much as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the total uncomputness that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something has try to create something has -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know that the creative process here -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process --
That sometimes it almost paranorally.
I have recenth the great American closer Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone meet meet of Ruth Stone of the great American closes of the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American close Ruth Stone disinctic of Ruth Stone disinction.
She is close in the nine. Her who's writing them.
She told me about her running on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the work, she felt was felt to be a poemp poems a poemp on the country.
It was so said she said that there was a big wave air came to ream air.
And that was poems poems about the country to it.
She felt that the ground, she felt started shaking and knew that she was just to do that moment only one thing thing to stood for her life: running for her lifetime.
And she followed by the poem and she had to go through the poem and see it had to see paper and see paper and see packs.
When the close was poems by her high-one was that her only her only to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't fast enough.
Then run, but it doesn't reach, it doesn't reach.
At the moments of school shot by her her hus, to be disappears -- in her words -- to another close -- to another closer -- to another close -- to another close -- to another country.
And I think of course, I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost of the story -- they almost of the poem almost mistake.
And she was in home looking for and paper and pies, and school poem through her it.
Juist at that moment she had a potrip.
And with her other hand, she was so told me she poets poem the poem of the air.
And she picked up with his tail, and put it back in her body, and put it back into her body, as she wrote the back of the polity.
In those cases came to that came to be a poems in a very primer order, but then in the case order.
When I heard that heard, I thought I was thinking -- which happens to be my creative process of ey!
And so my creative process is not not anyth! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not
I'm a miled mulrare every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating and trans it down.
But even in that daily I had a bunch of that day I had suddenly experience.
You're also knowing that you can also know that there are creative ideas in your broil reles from a source that you can can identify your impossible of impossible you can identify to identify of the impossible of the impossible of yourself in your broidentific.
What is that source?
How can we use the without that we are down?
At a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine I can think I can think I can think I can think is musicians to be a musicians.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way to this.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been a great of his life example of the amazing artists that comes out of all power to get all the power to the unittype of the intester of creative impulses that have been pushing him.
And with the '90s was Tom a little bit of Tom was run.
At he reflecting in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed it changed the process of radical.
And as he was so reflecting there and heard a fragmental of a melodie.
And it decided to him, like inspiration that fields, unground.
It was a beautiful elody and he wanted to be the fasth.
But that was not going to be that.
He had no paper type, no paper -- not a tany basically paper --
The well-familiar exciting exciting the melody is wrong, "I remains it turns me the melody remains me to be the familiar back to the melody returning of him.
I'm not good enough I can't do it right."
He doesn't reflect in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the wheel, you can't see that I behind the wheel?"
"Do you really think I can do a song on a song of the right now?
If you really want to get that this song is going to be later once you have to do for you.
Not not, somebody else didn't have a lot of fall.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohently from the process of the process of the process of very different.
The work is the same thing that is the same dark of the dark subject.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him called the creative process of the enjoy of the genius.
The genion to close close and liver skin and just just just just close to the skin and just just just just close to close it.
And to realize that there was no reason to go through through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizarre ship, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that was not quite from Tom and own wass.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a trip of course.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle in the middle of Ets, Biddines.
And at a given moment I think in despair.
You know that well, you don't want to work and you wouldn't get a good disaster, and you think it's a terrible disast. The book is just a terrible book of it.
Not just just a bad bad, really horrible bad.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project.
And then I remembered Tom that I was to be able to be a wishing power.
I went from my manuscritics and I focused to me a lot of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of my manuscritical crip.
And I said "Listen this, we know all this, we know all this, we know all through this is not just coming through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I stop in what I have.
I can't give you on.
If you think it should be better can, you have to do your thing.
Do you don't do that? Do you don't know you, you're not going to be right?
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular notory are going to be a bit of office is a different."
Tja--- Un--- United it comes here,
Euws came to be in the North African African desert people to dance together to dance at monkey to dance music.
And at at the challenges and hours to the morning globs.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very single happened, something.
One of those dancers became than transcene.
You know what I mean, you know, you also have a little bit of that, you also have seen a performer.
It was almost of time and the dance and the dance of a prive.
He doesn't did anything else than the thousands of nights.
And suddenly he didn't expect a longer only a human being.
In him, under him, above him, above him.
A good fired fired him.
If such something happens to happen to be people who was going to start clapping them to clap and in chair, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because that was for them.
By the way, a fun fun, historical fact that says, "When the Moren Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu South South South South Spanu South South Spanu South South S
The quote is real reals, by the centuries, being a changed of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oy."
That hear you today the day to died, at the day and flamengodances.
If a panine in Spanine something impossible or magic or magic saying, "Allah, own, Allah, oone, Allah, obraravo."
Right? Anyway, sic: a glimpy of God.
Priies what we need to need.
Laster is that the dance that the dance of the next morning to the discovered that he discovered on dince 11 hours of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning.
At that moment is he again, a little bit again, which is a little bit more again,
Maybe never to be anybody God will never be anybody dans.
What to he now has to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show to show for a creative mind.
But so painful needs to be not to be it doesn't be it.
Imagine you don't have to be the most unusual aspects of your person coming from your person coming from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have a while of a while of not a while not nather than a bunch of a not nather than a source.
When you are ready to somebody else to somebody else.
That's what profound, opportunity is everything.
I handle incentives that though.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside that inside the book that in a lot of reach that is going to be looking at is outside to be expensive to be expensive to a book that inside of a book that inside of a book that inside of a book that inside of a book that I worked in a short of reach to have a book that in
The opportune of that illustrated.
If my mind to the hold mind me to go and hold me the same for, I don't know the same for.
Do just your work.
Don't do your doing, which is it also on.
If the task you can too, dancing this.
If the good genius, that you have to decide to make your work on enious enyon-moment something of the wonderful source of the wonderful source, "Olllet et off."
Not happens not, dance then, dance but then only through that.
And also then, "OK, OK, right."
I believe that I believe that heart.
"OK, whate." And because we put out of pure human love and owness wisdom by staying plooters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole
You know, I had a few of these projects, I had a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and it discovering new sets of sets genes.
We started to go from a new point of passing a new point of the digitalize the digital code to a new phase of that digital code to a new phases and synthetic designing and synthetions of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand on different levels in different level.
We tried to have different approaches to minimum components.
We're now almost 20 years on the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize it now almost 20 years on the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the room.
When we have sequence, the human genome sequenced, it went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask we try to regenerate life creates or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of may be a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a smaller genome can get a little next genome.
We can do in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so, that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that is relatively simple to the one.
Believe me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can probably piece of the genes of may be unliving a living cell that this would be a living couldn't live a living cell that this would be a living certain of the genes that we can probably get to the living certain of the genes that we can probably get a living close to make survive that this would be
We decided to be that the only route pretty was to synthetic so that we could synthetic so that we could deplot the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started to ask with questions like "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthet?"
And the chemistry the chemistry the very large molecules that we never see?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome of the called ""
A chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is accelerating exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code to write the genetic code, but is genome to be environment.
And our last point would be the places on this moment curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were some of the number of city, to start with a bio-ethic typical tsing form to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be hard to be hard.
There's a thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, so the more faults of thouss.
So we had to do a new method for the society of these little pieces and corrigate of all pieces and corrigate all the wrong.
And this was our first poggetting with the digital information of the genome Phi X-74.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of pieces did the wrong correction.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of the bacteria piece of chemical stopping in the bacteria and the bacteria is the genetic code and making viral particles --
The viral particles were solutely from the cells, they came back and deaths after that, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was undestrips with the oil industry, and I said that they said that they just said that they just said that they were all too good fast.
They laughing over you.
And so we think this is a situation where we think this is a situation where the software o-ware own in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
That's why we decided to build them in cassetts, so that we could figure the cassetts, so that we could put the cassetts, so that we could put the cassetts,
to understand what the real components of a living clean components of a living cell
The design is critical information and if you start with digital information in computer than that are very accural information in computer than you have to be very accurame.
When we first put it together this genome was in 19995 was the standard of the standard per 10,000 basepars.
And eventually we found after 30 failured to 30 failure. And if we used the original sequence, it was not to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start the origin
And, of design is the design is the design of the design of 50 letters that have to continue with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build 50 letters that we need to design so that they can design to design so they can go to design so that they can go to design and then design a lot of the design of the designing of 50 letters
We designing unique unique unique unique to be unique unique unique unique unique of here.
Maybe you have read to you read water notice that we are in stopping them.
There's a square of this: we have a four-lettery code: A, Gown.
Trios of those letters code for 20 amino-to-si-o-o-by-od-terial attacks.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write, thought.
And so, we only called the called the called the moment.
Some of them were told that there were no poems were not poems were not poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can open them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and put them in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters and you piece of 24,000 letter, take to 72,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stadium we could have a continue of these pieces so that we could sequences to create them.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbasketbal.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate and they don't grow so easy more in E. coli.
That is the extinue of all modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to be true to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination," which is used by the biology to repair by the biology to repairs of DNA pieces of the biology to add a mechanism that can feet.
Here's a example of that.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million raid to the opportunity.
You can see that in the top panel, shows you can just clear from each other.
12 obvious later 24 hours later on the room was first of like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms that are this.
These organisms can completely opened around.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in the space can exist, that can be example, a new aquatically can find environment.
NASA has show that there is a lot of them is that there is a lot of that.
Here's a real micropphotographs of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- fact with only gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we were in the right design of the pieces that we were doing them.
And it makes it comes automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish, we transfully.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuulges is over 300 million of type of 300 million.
If we were going to be pression with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, there is 142 pages only to present the genetic code away.
Good, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the things we start it?
And with a virus is a clearly easy.
And with a bacteria is much complicated.
It's also simpleer if you put under eukaryots, like us, you just wheel, you just wheel, you just a different in, and that's what you know if you just know if it climb as it climb as it clione.
And in the bacteria kind of chromosome of the chromosome of the cell in the cell but we left have a complete transplant transplant to a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to a different, and activate.
We have a chromosome of a microbbing of a microbbing species.
These are about so far as far from each other, as people and mously moded as people and mously mouth.
We add some extra gene so that we could have to do this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the primary of the ectrial.
We have the reflect with enzyms to make all the protein of the eds.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the very advanced graphic images here, and you will be value -- the new chromosome of the cell of the cell of cell in the cell of cell --
We thought he was just to show that he would come to be able to develop the process of developing out of develop.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of right have a second chromosome of chromosome of the third somewhere in the third of thousands of properties in one times of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution to representation is not a lot of biology have not much biology to change a lot of biology have been reportunity.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that are really realize DNA real.
The chromosome that in the cell that was not ever eating.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop -- well,
It was expression, and it was recognized the other chromosome of chromosome of material, and therefore we had only eventually only the cell of the new chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cromosome of chromosome of the cromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the course, and
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time disappearing all the characteristics of one of the kind of change, and changed it completely in the new kind of based on the new software that we stop.
All the membrans changed the membrans -- when we had changed genetic code primary was changed.
This may sounds like genomician-alchemistry, but we are in state, by change the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental --
Good, I have a pathy before this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a break -- this is a basically at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have almost a new version of the Camble explosion of the Cambased on this digital new species that may be based on this digital design.
Why would you do?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what it is.
We go into a six--half to nine billion people, for 40 years.
And to put it in my context to place it in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets.
for each of us that lived in 1946; within 40 years will be that there are four in 40 years.
We have a try to have a food, with clean water, medicine, fuel for the six-and-half billion billion.
That is difficult to do that.
We use five billion tons of coals, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we have biological processes in eyars in edge or anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of being a huge challenge of biological processes in order to replace that we have a huge challenge to replace that we have a huge challenormous of biological processes.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is a cool dioxide of course, there's all that carbon dioxide of course, there's all this carbon dioxide of course, there's a carbon dioxide of c
And though our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see that I like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had just had a dozen-up different components, and look at the diversity that has comed out of the diversity that comes out of that.
We are pretty concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a technology faster synthesimagins to do so called combination to do the combination genomics."
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes of genes 20 million different genes to optimize octan, to make octan, we can produce to produce octor, we can change with a little team of team biology than we do a little bit more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life burness, chemical or production, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen imafic picture of what real designs that we work on the getting and a new kind of on the computer can design a new species on the computer.
We don't know person how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code
We focus on now on fourth generation.
And you have seen your flu to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation generation that are going to come from coming from coming from coming from coming from coming from the fired fuel of the butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can be biology without the food price without the food price of available and the availability to get as his food, and we think that are food. And we think that are we begin to design cells that we have the first sources of the first fours of the first square fuel inside generation within about 18 months of the first months of fires of the fires of through that we are fires of the fires of the food.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It live in the deep sea and a half miles dep, in cool cool of temperature of temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way or we can take CO2 is to take a failed through can be fabried to factory where that CO2 is being returned to be back to fuel thing.
So in a short time we think we are in a short of time, we are able to break on the basic question: "What is life?"
We have a real, you know, -- you know, the soccurred to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do that?
A important energy source become.
But we also now we're also using these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools.
This year was the flu, we always just something behind the facts like the facts coming on the right now on the right of the right vaccin.
I think that can change by making of textypes of textory vaccine.
Here's how the future can see the future of evolution tree is going to change now, the accelerate of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually endous eukary eukaryota.
We are away from the improve of people.
Our goal is to survive that we make a chance to survive a chance to survive that may be able to do that may be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to be a new technology that we have to do to a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can local or on the distance, with immense amounts of visual data.
We put many gigabytes here to digital images and can be nedless on blind and then made it and the sort of terrific, and the sort of terrificians and the sort of terrify to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the point of the collections or images are or images of being pictures.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixal reach.
It all doesn't matter because the only thing that it would be exprestations would be affected on a subject system, the amount of pixels on the screen of pixels on the screen of pixels on the screen of the screen of pixels on the screen of pixels on the screen of the amount of pi
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image data.
This is a graute by Dickens. Every single colum is a capture.
And to prove that the real text is actually telling and not a picture, we can do something like this, to show that this is not a picture ish.
Maybe this is a bit of a bit of a book.
I wouldn't reach it.
This is a realisticer example. This is an example.
Every big picture is the beginning of a particular part.
This is the fun, and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium.
We also have something to do with the extiny of this expensive of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertising of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information information information of information --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you see here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really really make the constrains that we can really do the constrains of accumber through the screen of action.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course, country to be a for the hand application for a technology like this, I will not spending a technology -- I will not spending this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And on the top, on the top, on the NASA of the NASA
Let's now look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who connected two techniques of them.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Snah Snah, and on the University of Washington, deeply by Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seits on U.W.
and Rick Smelliski to Microsoft Research. A nice called
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The room of the room has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have brains to be continue -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies in the Canadian Rockies -- where they genomes are seeing from stabilized diassociated diashor, and all these things are spaceases of stability.
I don't know sure or there is time to show or there is time to show of it is to show of it --
There's a lot of space.
I want to like to do one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we work -- to be the communicating I have in my head of the real power of this technique of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to stop the advocaturs and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Noe Dame, with images from Flickr. You just just looking for Noe Day in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the came of people and the camp
And each of these orange looking at the picture that are part of this model of model in this model of model
And so these are all Flickr imagining imagining these kind of space in this way room in the way of room
And we can on simple simple point of the simple way.
I had never thought I had never thought I would ever work at Microsoft of the Microsoft of that.
It's so much about this is so figure out here to be so much about here.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are camera's reflexcameras, a big number of this, a great number of this,
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much more called by face and through it.
Anywhere between this, even a series of pictures -- here's a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Now Dame Dame also that is goodged by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physically image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do is that we really do with the social environment. This is now the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of home -- and sells that everything to each other.
All these pictures are connecting to each other, and a lot of bigger than the subjects of the parts.
You've got a model that from the entire Earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the entire Earth of the earth of the entire Earth of the model of the entire Earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the entire Earth.
And that if a considered on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephans work on the U.S.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to be used and also the benefits of people who are using it.
Their own pictures are being coming from metaphor-data that somebody else invoted.
As somebody would like to attack and their names and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Day's going to be using with all that data, and I can use that metaphold to that metaphold of everybody else moment, used of everybody else might modal, and creating social experience.
And of course, the continue product here, is a rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who only not only pictures, satellites and other pass and other passing of the collective and other passs, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all of the images that are shared by everybody on the world can get to the world together?
BAA: Yeah. What this really doing is discovered.
The creates to create your wish, hyper-bened.
And it does that on the fasis of the data in the picture.
And that is designing when you think about the riches of semantic information that you think about a lot of these images.
When you go to the web looking for imagins, you can see a search of the piece of the piece of the past on the webpage of the picture of what the imagination about what the image of the image of fields.
What if you put that imagination is on your imagination of your imagination?
Then the number of subject-semantic connections and the amount of coming out of that, which comes from coming out of the classic. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredibly incredibly ad.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and eating of eating eating the possibility to live between them, who are not forgetting their past, who are not feel eding, the coming of their policists in reason in the wind, the profound bloaded in bitterribly bittery stones in bitterrible planning in bloaders.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still remoded to the Milky galaxy of Inuit-parents, or that the myths of Inven-old bood-boodhist boodhist on the boodhist of Dharma, you remember to remember remind the world in which we are not living a public opening of the anthropolicy-made of the world is not a model of the world in order of the world of the basics of the work of the working of the working of the myth, but is not to be able of the work of Dharmyth, but we reminousound of Inter,

So it can't surprise that we all sings, dancing and art have art and art have the art of the art of the results.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritme of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the uniqual culture.
Or that now is to the Penan in the wouldn't have the Voo-basical acolia -- or the fight-batch, or the freed-basically in North Kaya, the Curandero in the Andes-bergist of Caravanced in the Caravanserai in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the high of the corner of the Cara-basically -- or now a momentangma s;
And, the godin the godin the world.
They all learn us to think we can be differently, differently, differently.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea can only give you hope on it.
And so that the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and it turns and so important is as important as the biological life -- the biological life.
This cultural life web you can imagine your life as a editory fair.
The cruster of the course of all the time, you can definite of all the thought of all the thoughts, mythes, mythes, mythes, mything, inspirations that are brain of our consciousness of us by the beginning of our consciousness of us consciousness.
The cruster is the big nalatence.
And she's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be amazing and already amazing resulatory species.
like the biosphere is just like the biosphere is that called is the edgetting -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would be driven that was at least half of all the species of all the species of extinctions of extinct because that's simple, simple.
And the most apocalyptical scenario scenario is not even coming in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this.
And then everybody here are born here to be born on the earth of the earthousand languages.
A language is more than her word or her grammatic regular regully.
A language is a language of human sould.
It's the ferture, which the soccurious culture the material world is reaching material world to reach.
Every language is a noud, a disturband, a distread, a disside, a picture of spiritual possibilities.
From that sixth thousand languages today is not a half of the day of the kids of not kids.
They are not along babies no longer to be touched up.
Effective means that they already change, that they already change, they already all dead.
Is there something substantly substance, the last of your popular popular language of your people, not to have the wisdom of the wisdom of the children by the kids of the children to see the children teaches of the children ted?
Popion that terrifics is somebody's letting somebodys, somewhere on earth, because every two weeks and with him the last letter-field, and with him the last letter-fired language.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't have better place if we all were the same language of the same language of you know, "Suba names. Or Kantone."
Or Kogi." You are sure to be surface how it would be not to speak your own language.
So what I really want to do is going to take you on today is to take your eat, which is a little bit of a little bit of what is in fact, a picture of what is in fact,
And many of us to forget that when I talk about another way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different ways.
Take for exampleasan-Amazing child in the North Amazone, the people, the follows of the anaconda, that they believe the melk of the anaconda, from the eastomic, in the east, in the east, in the east.
This is a pular that cognitive the colors and not supply because it wonderfully of the wonderful of the equal of the oers of the oers of the oers of the oer.
They have a current-highly tool, which is linguistic exogamy is called you to somebody who is you have to say to somebody who is a different language of language that is a different language of language that is a different language of language, you have to be a different language-named language.
This is his roots in the mythological past, but the particular full in their houses, where six or seven talks are sleps by these crawly, but you never heart somebody hearing anybody hearing a language heart.
They are simply and start speaking and start speaking.
One of the fascinating tribes that I level tribes that I level the Waorani in North Ecuador, a refull that in 1958 free-free contact was contact to be contacted to be contacted to be a fascrack to be a contactic ago.
In 1957 tried five missionarive missionarians contact and they made a critical fault.
And so, they were seen pictures of pictures from themselves with us-friendly bars, where they were going to be a second never a two-dimensional image picture --
They were talking about the photographs and tried to find the form behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the form behind the photographs and they were looking at the form.
And when they don't found anything they found that the divel of them and they were through this, they were the missionaries.
But the Waorani doesn't just just the extracts, but also the each other.
fiftcame from their death-fift-fift-fift-fift-fift-fiftcul, fiftcular percent of their deaths.
We could have genealognizing generations to eight generations to tract eight generations for two cases of a natural death of a natural death of course,
And when we went through they gave to the same thing that one man ever diever diever diever died, he was just just a amazing of age. But at the same time they had a amazing of the edition of the oerwishing of the eye.
Their hunters could be clear on 40 pass distance, and tell what animal species of it was.
Begin years, I got a remade a remaining operating up when my profession to me when my professor I wanted to go to Haiti to go to Haiti genever engagest the basis of president of the power of president Duvaleral elities like his presidential elitorps and so the same out of the power of the power of the power of made of the be.
And to these sensational things that can understand what to understand something about this particularly believe of Vodoun from Vodoun that is not a cult of black magic magic.
It's a complex metaphysical world-picture, very interesting.
Would I ask you the big world's religions to call the big religions of that?
Christistone thing, islam, bood, bood, job, job, etc.
One continent is always coming outside of the attack that Africa didn't have the Sahara no religious believed the Sahara no religious believed this --
And so, of a simple, simply the destins of this depended religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during the slavers of the slavery.
What foodoo is so interesting is the living is living between the living and deaths.
The living booms of the mind.
The minds can be touch from under the Great Water, answered on the dance of the dance of the living time, so that during the same of living time, so that during one that during the following is the god.
That's why they love to say "You're going to be a white and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you're so saying by the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a blue-fold shows in trance that shows in trance that are primary glowing coal primary glowing collist of books.
This is the opportunity of the mind to influence the mind to influence the mind to influence the extreme is in extreme extreme is in extreme extreme is extreme extreme is the possibility of the minute.
And from all the people I've ever have left with all the Kogi, the Kogi, the most extraordinary of Colombia.
African called the Tairona-civilization, which ever the Caribic coast-flail of Colombia in the nasleeping of the real.
They were pull back in a piece of ulcanic mass fill that above the coast-tory mass the coast.
In a blood blowed continent was just continent was just reference, through the Spanananany of the Spananjustics.
And they are still by ritual priest-tool, but the training to priester is pretty pretty pretty air.
The young acolions are reflected to their families as they were three or four are.
They are several in a world of darknis, in stone, in stone, in stone, in put 18 years.
Two period, for nine years, for nine years, to make the nine months of form after the nine of their mother beautions that they are in the school of their mother of being their mother through to the school of their mother to be benefits of their mother to be break for the nine months of their mother of nine years,
Now they are now in the school of the big mother.
And these whole time they are all the society of the society that are the tributting in the trial values that only have been reported to be the cosmic or ecological edance in stand the cosmic eyars in stand the society.
This increase continues to the day they are indicately to be in and first of their life, if they are 18 and seeing a sunsopped in the sunsopping of consciousness of the first lights, if the Sun landscape of the witters of landscape that she learned in follow lightly considered in follow lights. The princidently say: The prise she is going to say that she is that they are in following in follow the s:
"You know, it's the way I said you've got you.
And so beautifully is the real to you think of you." They call himself the older brothers.
And we are the younger brothers, who are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the restroyces of the world.
And at this point is the intuition is very important.
If we think about indigence, and landscape, and we are often to Rousseau and the old fabull-fabully of the epart of the epartice of the eparticle, a idea that racistic is a simple.
Or we put Thoreau and say that these people, you know, closer to the Earth than us.
Indicse people, are nor sentimental follows by nor by nor right nostalgy.
For both is very few space in the malariamoers of the Asmat or in the icro-winds of Tibet. Desn't have a temporary she through time and ritual mystical mystical of the Earth mystic mystical of the Earth is based on a lot of subtle intuitional intuition that the idea can be basically exist, because of the idea can be consistan, because of the exist, because of the existency of the existence.
What does that mean? It means a little kid from the Andes, which is growing growth is growing the mountain Apu-p-mind is going to lead to be a fundamental and will be a different relationship to that ground-stand-bunch child place that the flu or that the idea that the idea that the idea that the mountains of the idea that the mountain of the mine of the mine that the idea stance.
Or it the lives of a minute or a lot of it, is irrelevant is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that the keeping defining the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capital to be capital.
That made me a different than my friends from my friends from the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forests are the living of Kuxwhose and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kroms of the world's orth and the officient of the world's ororth of the world's hearing of the world.
These mind are important at their Hamatsa-in-education.
If you start to the idea that these cultures are different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary discoveries. Now, you take this plant.
It's a picture I go in the North Amazon Amazon nam.
This is ayaa-huascaascaascaases, the most powerful psychoactive reaching the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaa's ayaaxhuasinating is not just the fascinating of them, but how do it is. It's built to be built from two sources.
And every similar is a lot of lightly carboline, harmaline and hearm aline in the wireline and light hallucinating works.
If you just take the plant of the plant rookwalm by a blue refleured by your drive.
The plant is mix, with leaves from a coffee of a coffee being fridis.
The plant trips powerful tryptamines, nrain tryltryltryltryltryptonine, 5-methoxyltryltryltryltryptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they seen that susion of different species that are also substance of different species that are also seen methoxyltryltryltryltryltrys?
That pool your nose in blower nose, is like a better of being shots, to country to country to a sea of electricity. This is not a distribution of the reality; the ship of reality; the ship of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shults, to convincing a man who discovered the psychediscovered by his psycheal, by his paddos in Mexico in the '30s.
I painted that these tryptribute that these tryptamines were not to identify because when the effect of their effect intree is not to do the hallucination. Tryptributting hallucination. Tryptamines are not orginating their effectly in the human darmous oximagines in the human darming oxida.
They can only be oral to be environmental with something that the monoamin of you effect to be doing the sample of the saminiar of something that the monoamin of something that the monoamin of something that the monoamin of the samin's going to be only oral to be just through the saminion of something that the monoamin of something that the sample of the oral of the oral oral of the may be only oral to be to oral oral through oral to be only oral to be to oral to be to do with oral orgood to be to be to oral oral to be to be to be to be to be to mean to be to be to be only through the plaffectrue of do do do do is dofect
The fascinating is that the basic carbolines in the liance of the legal monoamine-suppression of the tryptamine, the tryptamine. Stel yourself the question of two morflora of 80,000 plants, two morfology species that are increated a biochemical various species that are bigger than the combinating of the parts of the part of the part of the parts of the s?
We say eufemistic "trial and ror," which is being designed in this is a teaching.
The Indians saying, "The plants talk to us," which means that they could mean that the Cofan, the Cofan, the Cofan 17 variants of ayahuca, who can identify all the great distance of the major of the eyes would be one-species that would be able to identificians in our eyes as a kind of legal distance.
If you ask their question how they were their taxonomy in map them, say, "I thought you knew something of plants you.
You know whatever you know whate? I said "no."
And it turns out you can all the 17 species in a night to full moon in different totally showing in different today.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of boot boot than meeless.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who even those sympaths that even under us that sympath, they're seeing and smiring small of us and showing a footnast, but reduced to a footness, incredibly the real world, meaning our world, means our world, means our world, death.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years is not going to be remember or technological innovations, but before we were stunning stone, and active particips or passive active particips or passive active in biological diversity of biological diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always part of a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Siously indians they stop, when they put their pile, just as well, as well, as messages Americans and stopped their horse, when they were their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that the integrity of the edition of the edition.
The wred face of the government.
What you are also looking at the world, you notice that it's not flocks, you will now from these cultures.
These are dynamic living people, whose existence is being coming by identified force of their attack form of adaptation possibilities.
Or this is going to be the enormous forestation in the home land of the Penan, a nomage of South Asian enorganist that to the walk and now with the last generation and now reduced and now is to service and prostitution to the rivers that you can see that the rivers you can see that the rivers of Borneed by the South Ariver to the South Aunovel Chinese Zuidanse Suidan's South South Avily Suastanse that Japanish.
to fill their ships of fill out of the forests.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that are inside his inside as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan, where I do a lot of research of political government, you can see the wread of political government.
Genocide, the physical except is a completely universal result, but evated, the destroy of life is not only not just cause a not only not just afford to disn't afford a lot of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain, until you get on the basic level level level of coming in in.
I have a young colleague about 9,000 miles about 9,000 miles about China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa came to be able to go to the face behind the statistics where you heard about it.
6,000 Hiliily monuments destroy 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was knowing to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis he directly was death when the Chinese invasion.
His uncleaning to the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who is the people to in Nepal already broad.
His mother prisonered because she was rich because she was rich --
He was smoky called the prisoner when he was two to be under her rok, because she didn't be without of him without she couldn't she couldn't have she clean to clear him and he was connected to be two and he was breakid.
The sister that was so stopped so hero-type camp.
At a day stape primary on a Mao. For this over-poor these overpene-year-old put seven years old last years.
The pain of Tibet can be unbearable to be unbearable of the people, but the completely is something to clight your fast.
And finally it comes down on a choice.
Do we have a live world of subjectory life or want to live a color any world of diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity of supply of suppossibility world of supply of diversity of diversity or want to be a color want to be a color want to be a color want to be a living a colormental world of diversity of diversity of diversity of that we live in a col
The big anthropologe Margaret Mead said that she was death that she direction, that she direction.
We wouldn't just see the human imagination are also seeing a smal, modition, but we would have to wake a bit of other options and forget to existence that there are other options of exist.
We can feel to feel us feel about the idea that our species about [15000000] years.
The Neolution, which we were only going to be failding on the culture of the cular of the cular of the seed, when the poetry to replace of the shaman and we were just replaced by the prozeros and we got a shot of the prief of the prief of 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history doesn't give me the idea that we don't have all the answers to all the answers of the next millennia on of the next millennia on on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked of people, they were asked to 10,000 different voices of the world they were with 10,000 different voices.
And it is that we have to discover that we will figure out what we are going to be discovered to be what we are, a full species that everything in the work and all the global folds and all the gars. There are great. There are great-moments of optimism.
This picture I have on the northern point of Baffin Island genome went on narwas.
This man, Olayuk, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inuit. In the '50s were going to be increated to realities to real results in the corporation.
The opa of Olayuk to go.
The family of his life and discovered, and he came for him already him already him already his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Infrom not afraid for the colle; they made it uses to use it.
The glish icros, the glish of their key were made of fishing in caribon of fish.
Olayuks up for the polar for the pollnight or the storm that wireless that was being windown.
He went outside his brows skin his bakes and put in his hands. And then he put the pristices, shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a lot of laws on the side of the mess.
When it solid was, he was sleeping a dog me.
He did the dog and improvision and improvision to be a harnas.
From the ribal benkast, he was a bast.
And he looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice flat flat pool pool pool of pools.
Anything about nothing to be so. And this, in many ways, state symbol for the weather of the Indicators and all the indigenous people.
In 199999 gave the Canadian government government the Infrom a full concerned a piece of country and Texas Texas and Texas together and Texas a home of Nunath.
It's independent area. They read all the grounds.
It's a connection to example of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation to be able to be able to off.
And finally, I think it's clear to this praying, at least for who is at least for who is not required to these home doesn't far away away away away away away away away to this up.
They are somebody's home country.
They are standing of the human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of time. And for us, the dreams of these kids will be unbasically become unbreak of a children's impact of hop.
What we ended up at National Geographic, is invented from the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic, we think that a polemic -- we think that a polet of stories that stories can change the world, which we probably have the best of the world, which we probably the best of the world, Our website a month of 35 million times a month a month of trips on a month audiences a millions of public.
We make a lot of traveling to travels to the eat, with our public world with our public cultural places, where the towards so increased by what he sees the towards so infound by what he sees hopefully one of the important opening opening of the anthropology will be confidence: that this world in different in different in a multi-edge-for-we can live in a multiplicity.
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom can contribute to us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of you about some of the questions I have dedicated a book,
Maybe you can see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain that you may be able to explain that you may be mistake.
I want to start to start with the official dogma."
to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Western settly, industrialized society.
And that official doggma as follows like this, to get the follows on the highest level, we have to get to get them so much as much as possible individual freedom and so much as possible of freedom as much as possible of citizens on the highest level
Freedom is a great good substance of the human best.
Bovenes are still to freedom to act our own insight-insight-flet-figure out-mil without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in freedom
And more freedom means automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would have nobody would have to draw during on the during of the during of the during that nobody would be so deep early to draw this is so deep equal that nobody would be dragonfail.
And in our lives is this dogma buried of reflected.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A big.
Anything about thressing.
And that 175 can-ty-hun-dressings are in my supermarketplaces and different extra-virgin my supermarket and a lot of oil and a different balsamicos and a lot of samicos and a lot of this.
And you can do the tripe of the trips own dressings for 175 types that are nothing between 175 types of you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can strone-your stereoset of strone-plakers, cassettespecially diverster.
And so on the one electronics of the electronics you can choose out of this primary from this trip.
You can be able to be six-million different systems together to subject from that story.
Give today, you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could all put your all sorts of picture to ask young services but only at Ma Bell.
You don't she went to be the straight power.
That had the pretty passing that the privilege.
That time is pretty again.
Today are a lot of different stretches of stretches.
And especially with cell phones is the diversity is the diversity.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with musher legal downer and criters per and critical letting critical --
And you know, clight you can do this model in the wink, but you can certain of you can make sure that that happens in the win.
The consequence, people come to the wine, and asking this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question to the answer --
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more importantly than the point of stuff is this explosive of choices of choices of choices is a fact of choices of choices of choices of choices of the tributtting of stuff that are much more importantly than the possibly of choice of stuff that are much more important than the attack of the pects that are much more important than the possibly importantantor,
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. not so you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you must do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they says, "We can do that, we can do that.
And, and close has this for, and nase.
There is this for, and then what are you doing?"
And you says, "Doker what?"
And the doctor says, "An this for, and nase, and then this for, and then this form has this form and naded it.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you was, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that we call "selself-burning of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact that the heavy of decision of decision of somebody -- the doctors -- to a doctor, somebody who is a free and not the best concerned and not the best concerns -- the patient. For on on on recipe on to take the patient.
Good considered that sleep, because the goal, because the goal, you can't buy group, you can't buy it.
Why makes you copening them, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we think we are the next morning to ask our doctor to ask to ask that other market medicine.
Our idents, our idents, as a common existing aspect of our existence, is now considered to see.
Our identity is to read our identity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want to like.
Every morning to the opposition to be your mind to be what for person you want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that fail everybody else that was going to be so fast as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as fast as possible to children as quickly as
The only real choice was with writy, not when and what you did died.
Now is free for the opening for the opening for it.
I give lesson for intelligent students, which I developing 20 percent less house, then ever early than early early than early early
They don't be funny dommer or like, in the early time.
No, they have the pressure.
"Well, I say whether not? I now?
Or I'll take a wait? I first want to wait? I first first children, or a career?"
These are all reasons.
They are going to have a answer to them, also if this means they don't get all their house, and they don't get all their house, and therefore not a good fired by not good fire.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just gave that technology is to work on every minutes to work every minute of every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place I think I think I think I think that WiFi the do.
I don't know what I don't want to be true for memiself to keep for myself to keep for myself.
But anyway, those huge choice of work kept in that we have a lot of work on the work of whether we're going to work or now.
We can look at a footbalwirst, with our song, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all stand every minutes of that competition of that competition with all sorts of question: "Well, I am this phone count?
And I think this emailt respons? Are I write this letter letter to writ?"
And even if the answer of "Ne" is we experience the footbalwish of our son a very different way.
What we also look at the big, the smalley, materialistic things are living life is a question of choos: life is a question of chooss.
And so the world early looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like now.
The question is nowing now?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects.
A very opposition is that the earlier is that the earlier before.
And so much choice as much choice as much choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of a very dramatic example of investments in free pensioence planns.
A colleaguage of me to invest data from Vanguard, a big policy data of me a big policy society of the result of 2,000 stresources of 2,000 stress.
They found that for every 10 percent foundation foundars that tributes the worker box, the particular two percent devices of the trip.
And in fifound 10 percent less than 10 percent less works, five founds. Why?
Because it's fifty fundressing is so difficult to choice that people just extend to the next day, and that opened up there, and so on.
And from extend to be coming from the exist.
That doesn't just that that people people after their pensioner pension-bread because they don't have enough money not enough money because they don't have been a fasticully so distious that she was working on the work of work for them.
And they walked to be that they walked to 5,5,000 dollars a year for go.
The worker was incredibly to double, to double.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice can work on a lot of choice can work much choice can work much choice can work a lot of choice a lot of choice can work a lot of choice can work a lot of choice.
And I think the world of the world looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right to make the right choice makes you a very lot to make the right of choice --
You don't want to be distribute with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect. And also we distribute the lost of us and choose eventually less text less texty than the result of the result of the result of the result of us as we had bed.
There's a multiple reasons for that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, the ressings can stay that the choice can't perfect perfectly perfectly didn't perfect perfectly on the choice,
You are in such a case for that another choice would be better better.
This was dreamed alternative alternative is that you get speeas.
And does explosed on the folded of the choice that you have made you've made a good choice was a good choice was a good choice.
The more options of the more options of easier to have a fair of unctions of unction.
Second reason of doing with substitution.
Dan Gilbert from morning, because of the true of things we depended the value of things that we depended up the value.
If you can inand you can inand you can see many alternatives all also fast the attractive of all the alternatives of all alternatives you dead.
That makes you have less text less text that you've chose to be crazy.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example of example.
This is on vacation in the Hamptons.
They have a wound.
They are on a wonderful strand. Straling again.
Don't be writ? "Fordik," thinking, "It's aughty," thinking, "It's aughtype.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in my neighborhood in my neighb
I could put my car for the door, for the door."
And he is to simply two weeks to simply day that he was every day again, a great parking failed to be a great place.
Substitution cost of the fold of the folded of our choice that we have from our choice, even if we make a great choice of our choice.
The more possibilities are more possible alternative.
And those presentation of us as substitution.
Another example.
This picture, this pictures to some points.
Life in the here and now you have to do things that you don't have to continue to be down.
Another point is you know, you know, you can except other choices except.
And all that other has so attractive cans, which the gecost option that the gecoss.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came to this, I came to my search for a new brow.
I always always speak to always speeed.
And they were only only one kind of speaking it was only one kind of right and you do it. It was not incredibly unbelievable, but if you didn't have the broad enough and often the broek of the right and often enough the right and often enough the running OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a good broek, this is my makes me mak."
And the mall said, "Wilt you fit easy fit, easy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether a rits? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-wed?
Do you know a break with slupenty?
Wilt you have something expended pips a bit of pips." And so he went down."
I was going to talk about it. And after a while I said, "I want to said, "I want to say the only broek that was."
He had no idea which was that and he had no idea and so I have a long broeks all possible broeks on the possible breaks.
And I think of course, I left the winel endly enduring pass a bunch of pass pass pass of a break pass of pass a bit of pass fright, I left the winel of a bit of pass of honestly is a fairly pas
I had a better done it better that I could do it better do.
But I don't felt better.
Why? Because this to me, I wrote this book.
The reason I didn't feel better fellow with all this choice, was that I started to expect from a good speedition of a good speeds.
I started without any expecting, because I just just one kind of speaking a break of it.
And then turned out that there were different and one of them would be a perfectly perfectly perfectly --
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think I was my broken with my brow with my expectations, and that still me tol.
The more possibilities people have to have more possibilities about the deservation of those possibilities.
And that means people are less texts, with results, even if it are good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case I don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really going to be about it.
All was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was bad was bad of bad.
Because when everything was bad people were going to have experienced experiences.
