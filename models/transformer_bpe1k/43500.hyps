But this underestimate, the most of this particular problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The ice cap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide of what happens is a version of what happened in the last 25 years has happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice ice is dividual,
As you see it, it looks like, it looks like.
That's the year, that's the early winter the winter of winter the winter
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like flower, that from the body here.
In 25 years of this to this this.
And that's a problem because the frozen found the North Icell Icell warms and there is a very big warms and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon that when it was deeply in methane.
Commanding with the total amount of engineering in the atmosphere, that could double double the amount of the small of the critical point to the slagaps that would double the amount of the atmosphere, that would double the amount of atmosphere, that could double the amount of engineering how much as we write it as a lot of the atmosp

This pattern is completely intential intential to be completely intential.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 every 24 hours,
25 mios of every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, west-every side of the subcontinent, there is a drastic drastic drastic drastic dristic drastic drastic dristic driving in the ocean.
The only great causes of the Earth, is the warming of the Earth, which is basically deforestation, which is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and the coal is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the greatest extings with China.
And there was a present of building more of more stepport carbons.
But we see a course.
These are the spending carbon that the building was annumber of the last carbon in the last few years, and where green alternatives were presented to the last carbon
There is a political battle on the country.

Last year I gave an introduced about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works machine works on how that works machine works machine works.
So here I am here. For those of that didn't have the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment ever experiment ever understanding around 27 miles in the miles of the size of the scientific experimental experimental experimental experiment in the most scientific experiment exper
It has to be the conditions that were near less than a billion less than a billion of billion times a billion times a second of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitiously.
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work with the ATLATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in contactular so you can see the scale.
On 10 September last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture taken by ATLATLAS.
That made a party of the party of the croom.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the way around the LHC went around the LHC went around on the LHC with a piece of the LHC, through particles in the detector of the LHC, through particles in the detector of the LHC to be flated in the detector, and with a piece of the first particles that was going to be flying around the LHC to be flying around the way around the way around the way of the LHC, and with a photograph of the LHC, and with a photograph of the H, and I was going to be bonside of HC to be downales of the HCC, and with a ph of the HCC, and with a photograph of the dete, and was going to be doing around the detext of the detecline in
In other words, when we had this photograph at 10 September we knew that the machine worked on the machine works a huge overwin.
I don't know if this was the biggest of the most most right or this, or then, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet page there is so looked like this.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden down with these golden having with these golden drive.
And those wears are 13 thousand amper reading the machine on full power on full power on full power on full power on full power and the machine on full power to full the machine on full power on full power on full power to full the machine on full power full power on full power and full force to full the full power on full power and full power and they were full force to follower on followed 13 thorganired to worket force on fiewer and ckes fieckes and ftords.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small wear."
They can do that because they are superceive on all slow temperature on whole low temperature
So at multimes, colder than the space between the stars, the space that can go and go and then that can go and go and then the through the space that power power to the stars,
In one of the connections between the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructific.
And that was something warmer, there was something warmer, and there was something that was there was a thousand amper that was 13 thousand amper reflector.
This was the result.
This is another impressive when you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons of the weight, and they were about 30 centimeters moved in the same of thing.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have regardless of it.
Now they are back to way.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will go again and expect it again, and expect in June or Junli, so that we can figure out what the building the building straight?
Now, of course, of course, that have been rewards the debate of scientific research. It's easy research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so difficult, the fact that we go beyond the LHC.
I leave the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the define of his learning experiments of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of the mind of the human mind to take the advances of the human mind to take the front of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the human mind, and that there are no new being completely that our definitione."
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to go back to your children's enduring to your childhood when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to grain and then they picked up and consciously and consciously solved by learning and depended by the engineering of space relationships.
Rumultiply insight is strong because the world to understand of the world around us.
If an information -- inspired by physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my adviser Jeee of Kalanithi -- I started to ask me -- what if we were used -- what if we were used -- what if we would use a computer to use that one mouse to be able to move into a kind of digital finger-moving moving moving again, which is information to a plated, which we could flash with both information with a place of flating information that we could flately,
and can orders as we want?
This question of us so came to search a response we decided to search a answer to the build of Siftables.
Sified is a Sifty interactive computer in the size of a cookookie.
They can be moving with the hand they can be moving into the hand they can be able to detect and they contact a screen and wireless contact.
The corrip is the physical trade, as blocks can be moving by making it by grain by understand by gray to grain by understand
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulating digital information.
Because these tools have a more physical different of the movement and of the way we have a movement and even of the way we move them from each other and even of the way we move them different new and funning new and fun.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is increated to show a video that played by cancing office plays, and others and otherwise played and other.
These interactive portraits are awarenessarily consciousness.
And inside each other one of place, they will be interesting.
If they get surrounded to be surrounded this, and can be able to nerve.
And they feel movement and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of all of this interesting gears, as it was a color was a fluid of a color was a fluid of a color was a fluid of a color was a fluid of the interesting of everyday.
In this example three Siftables emmers to remarks, and I can use them to use color in a frame, where they get mixed to be color in a framework,
If we have driven to threw some back.
There are some cappe possibilities for education, mainly plays, mainly mathematics and logics that we want to give people to try to try to try to see things quickling fast.
Here I was a set of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci of a simple.
Here we show a game that a game between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a will, and then you get in every Siftable, and sensed words in a dictionary words in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is being a 30 seconds of being a new series of series of letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in it to try to make it out and make it out to make a video of making it out a video of it.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this applation is that people need to have almost no instructions need to have instructions of this application is almost interesting indication is that people need to have instructions.
Everything you have to say, "Make word." And they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the test of the test.
That's our youngest basically right.
It looks like he just stack the Siftables of wise step.
For him was just blocky.
Here is an interactive painting shown interactive painting
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix.
It can bring characters in the scene of the scene, by just the Siftable with that character of the table.
He sun, he reflect to the sun.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good go! Yeah! Yeah!
By the shape of Siftables and the next to each other places that he can respond to each other -- Video: Waly.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decisions how it walks on the right thing.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example that I will show show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent to a sound product that every Siftables as the lead, basss and drum.
One of four different variations, where you can use what you can use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in emptables are injected so that you can determine the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atternities of a leg Sift-fill effects are live controllaborious as reverble available, and filter.
They are become a sound and adapted by side.
And then, through the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a leaad in two Siftables, to a lot of a first pattern, lead.
Now I put the based right now
Video: Now I feed to do some slagwork.
Video: There I now the filter to the filter to the drums, so that I can influence the effect live live influence of the drums, so that I can influence the effect of the drums, so that I can influence the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: DM: I can get it by the canopy accelerating the obvious block.
Video: Now I couple the filter to the filter of the basas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rearms the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to planning everything to plann, but I can improvise, the getting very longer and shorter like I want.
And finally the did of the dims of the volume of the volume Sift to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new human being interfaces that are better interfaces that have been taken out in the way our brains that are better in the way our brains and working on the brains and working
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of the developing of capabilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the touch, this is just a new generation of resource to the interact with digital media that information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to go to to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Booking writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am not writing to change and I don't think that will change it.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, and career, which I had to see my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote a book that I wrote a memoire, "Eten, Biddle that was very opposed to my earlier world and a very single world and a very international concernational excitier.
The result is that people now everywhere, and always I have to be put down all the time.
World what -- really, true --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you will never be success to evenars?
Don't you keep your whole life will keep write you'll keep publish a book that people will be walk to the heat that people will be walk to you?
Don't you get there?"
Every single trial, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be remember that I was rararaw 20 years ago, when a teenager, when I told was a teenager, when I was write to be writing.
People said, "Don't you have never success?
Don't you know, you will not be afraid to go through it.
Don't you see that you live to this work without of this work without of this work out of the broken and that you're going to die on your broken dreams of bitters of fail?"
Something in that strip.
In the short coming to the short of that questions on this questions on down, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid all these things that are called the things that are called
Always that.
But I'm also many other things that you all don't know that all of this, you don't know that all of it.
For sea line ewith, and other one things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to the work for the work of work for the work of their opinion on on on Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we worry to make the effects of it on the mind of the minds, something that is not happened to be able to do something that happens to be able to do the other.
Take my father. He was chicky engineer, and I can't remember that there was a few 40 years that he was working ever in the 40 years that he didn't have a afraid he didn't afraid he was not afraid to it.
And so of the John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, so didn't work about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been engineers by the centuries are not the reputation of the reputation of manical depression of being a piece of being every frequire of being education.
Scheed, that have such a reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputation mental incredibly instable.
Look at the grim down, the most magnificent creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often do by own own own own to it.
And even those who are not suicide of the suicide of the farms of their gave under to be own.
In the last interview of his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit to say about your life work.
But of these kind of excited we don't look any more.
We all heard it before it earlier and have been accepted with small of accepted before.
The heart of thought is that creativity to be connected to be connected to suffering is going to be an artist, and that will lead to may lead to ellere.
So why do I want everybody here today, can you have this idea can you with that idea of life?
Finds you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I don't think about it, I don't think about the pretty thought.
I think it is the representation.
And also another dangerous.
I won't like to see this century is going to be so go.
We can creative mind creative mind to live a lot better to live.
I know it would be for me, in my situation, particularly dangerous particularly dangerous life.
Seach the fase where my career is now inside my career now is now in my career now
Go only after that, I'm young, amper safty a year.
I can work out of four decade through decades.
Heyast, probably everything that I'll be seen published by the outside of the outside of the outside of the extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends of friends up here, so I can slow you know, higher my biggest success of behind me.
Jemice, what a sense of an idea !
If you go think, if you think about it, you're going to be the morning to the thrank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work that I love.
The question is: "Hoom?"
After long after a long time I can go to the conclusion that I can only go through a psychological protection in the process of increase in the process of in.
I have to go down a safe distance a safe distance between myself and my over, and my over, very understand my over, and my consistantly fear publications.
I've been looking for ways been looking for ways to ways to ways do that.
I have been doing in history and have flated in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to see creative people to see creative people to help creative people to deal with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest of my quest has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Leaking up, because it's a long and complicated.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romin's believed people didn't believe that creativity was coming from itself.
And people believed that creativity was a dival mind was a goddressed of a privile, unknotable of reasons.
The Greeks called these guys, these are called "demonen."
And also he believed that he had a demon to be a demoon who had influence.
The Roman had a same idea.
In fact, the called creative mind creative mind a "genius."
The funny is that Romeins with a genius is not a particularly piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently piently pient.
In their polite was a genius a kind of magical entity that are opening up in the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work was working purpose of the genius was the genius of the genius.
He was working form shape to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was in his work.
The artists was so in protection to the artist, for example,
If you were working on a brilliant there.
Everybody knew that a knew that you had hold.
Word you work down your work, then not only that not only you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genius.
Long time is that the West, the way in the West, creativity was considered
Then came up Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, from the godly world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came to the individual
And for the first time in history was about artists of artists were said that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have a big fault.
To one person, one person, one individual individual that he or she or she or she or she fight or she or she fight before it famili, of everything that didn't dive, creative and the familiar is that something to a lot of responsibility for a fragility for a fragile human psyche.
Anybody to sun, the sun,
Egos are blowing up to giant proportions and there are unimaginable high-expectations of prestations.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists are capot.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What right now, what now?"
Can we do this different through this different?
Can we understand back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the crowd of the relationship between the relationship between age?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably people who have been in the audience people who have reading tools have been talking about the idea that elphysics of the idea that elphysics of the feet, the work of artists to inspiring high--inspiring heights.
It doesn't seem to be getting all of you in there.
And I wonder.
Why not?
Why shouldn't we have this thought to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next to next that thought to next that thought would we have this thought to next that thought to next that thought to next the thought of the thought of
It came as much as much as all the other explanations of the total uncomputation that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, all the presence here -- it knows that the creative process here -- it doesn't always rational process is not always rational process of it.
That sometimes it feels like almost paranormally put it almost paranormally
I've been able to meet recently meet of American closer Ruth Stone meet.
She is in the nine-text. Her lives all of life they closed.
She told me about her jeuth, and she was Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field, she was a poem about the country.
It was, as if there was a big wave air of air wave air came air came air came air.
So a poem golf than the country to it.
She felt that the flands started shaking her feet and knew that it was only to do that moment only one thing that moment to do is standing for her life.
She was ran home, back to home, and she had to see so fast as fast as possible, and then you can see paper and put piece.
When the poem through her hits was that her only her only to write it was her only to write it on the writing.
Sometimes she wasn't fast enough.
Then ran and ran and ran and run, but it doesn't reach the house
Someters school close by her hole, it disappeared, search -- in fact, in fact, in her words -- to another power.
And there were also there were a -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that she close the poem -- that she almost immediately.
And then she was in search for paper and paper and piece, and the poem through its its it.
Juist that moment she had a pencil of pencil
And with her other hand, so told me she picked the poem of the air.
She picked up to his tail, and it pulled back into her body, as she wrote the room.
In that cases came up with the close of the close of paper and all of paper and all the order.
When I heard that I thought -- what happens to be able to be my creative process of creative process of course,
So this is what my creative process is not a medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mile, who are every day on the same time, and sweat the same time, and sweating with blood, and sweat and sweating through it and trans through it is a good time on the same time.
But even in that day swer day I had such an experience of experience.
You will also know it will know that there are creative ideas in your board that there are creative ideas in your board from a source that you can identify you can identify include.
What is that resource?
How can we use it without we have been crazy?
On a way that we well?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the thought about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life has been realized of the showing of the shows that tries out of all power to get to the unlight on the untable creative impulses that increative impulses that including in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of a little rief of a little rstated.
One day he reflected in Los Angeles about the speeaway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he got there to be so took there he heard a classet of a meloddy.
It decided to him, like inspiration that is doing fired to do ingrate.
It was a nice nice melody and he wanted to hold it.
But that went didn't have thing.
He didn't had a piece of paper -- no piece, no tapial ecort.
The amazing exciting exciting exciting excited to him, "I close the melody is making the melodd of the back and then it turns out to me,
I'm not good enough, I can't do it.
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry you can't see that I behind the went to the sky?"
"Do you really think I can write a song of the song of the song of the song of you can write a song of the song of you can real a song of the song of you can real that I can write a song of the song of you
If you really want to get that this song is going to be later, you have to classes when I have time for you.
Now, you know, somebody else did somebody else fall.
Ga neighborhoods at Leonard Cohenty." And from that moment of the process of very different.
The work is the same, with the same dark of the familiar dark to.
But the heavy of the creative process that creative process in him distance, when he distance, he distance,
The genius was to close to the skin and liversion and only understand only understand only it up.
And then it was not realized that there was no reason to go through it.
It could be a wonderful thing, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner that didn't quite as a didn't quite as a bit was not quite as a wonderful.
That story has changed my way of work has changed.
I've been taking any of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle.
And at a certain point of moment I in despair.
You know, you know, you don't want to be a good work and you think it's a terrible disastance, it gets a terrible disast.
Not just a bad bad, really horrible bad.
I wanted to get the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that I wise, and I decided to be a possible possible to a possible possible to be a possible power.
I wished me from my manuscrips and directly to a full corner of the room.
And I said "Listen then, we all know this, we know everybody is not just this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop in what I have.
More I can't give it.
If you find that it better can, you have to get your thing.
Do you do not remember that, understanding right than.
I just write down, because that's the one of my work.
Oh, and in the notular is that disagreemental is a difference."
Tja--- it's coming up here on the right -- it comes up here.
Euth ago and came up in the North African desertions together to dance the music to move with Marlier of thanimal music
Urs and hours and hours to the morning glor.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes very single thing happened in a particular thing.
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you also have seen this thing that you can do something that with a perform of performer.
It was like the time was still stood and the dance, and the dance,
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights and all of everything.
It was a suddenly not seemed to be only a human being.
In him, under him, under him, above him.
A did fire, through three of him.
If something that happened to be a little bit of the time, people were starting to clap, and clapping into call, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nicular historical fact, when the Moren Spange Span, they broad this well.
The question's real real is changed by the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Oly, other."
That least you know, the day at the day at died, and flamengodance.
If a poorest in Spain something impossible or magically does, "Allah, Oh, other, one, "Allah, Allah, broa."
Right? Sometime, sick a glimp of God.
People what we need.
And later is the thank is the next morning at the morning at the discovered that he discovered on dincluding 11 a.'" in the morning of the morning is more it.
At that moment is he again, a little older man with debager with debt that might never to such a set of eye.
Maybe never going to have anybody God to have dancition of during his dance.
What do he now have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show for a creative mind.
But so painful don't have to be the need.
Imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person coming from yourself.
Imagine you believe them a while of a while of the which, I didn't have a little bit of a which.
When you finished ready with somebody else, they get to somebody else.
That's what everything is considered everything.
I hang inside that thought that though.
The last months I've been working on a book that will get into a book that will be appear. The book that many of reach reach is outside to be expensive to be expensive out of the last months,
The upon that illustrateger progressions.
If my thought to go on the hold me to go and I went on the same thing, I don't know. See not too far.
Do just your work.
If you just do this, what it is.
If you task is to dance, you know, dance.
If the goddle genius ded is to be able to decision to your work at enymoment of the wonderful source by leaving the wonderful source, "Ole.
And then, the thing happens, then, thance then, but it down.
And than: "Ole.
I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe harted.
"Ole. Anybody else, because we live and own, and owning wisdom by continue to stay by remaining the human love and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I've already had about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean, and then discovered new sets of genes.
We start from a new point of point: we were the biology to the digitize, and now we were trying to go from that digital code to a new phase to a new phase of life in the biology, with the designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And what I think of biologists have tried to understand on different levels on different levels in different levels.
We have tried different approaches of the different approach, the back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of the digitalize of digitization.
When we have sequenced, when we have sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask -- we can we live rain to regenerate new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory,
And we have tried to see if we can get to a non-genome can get genome.
We can go in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or soil,
But if we look at the metabolical map, that is relatively simple, simply simply to the one.
Beloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can shut piece of piece of piece of the genes of the cell of life would be able to living to live.
We decided that the only route condition to synthetic this chromosome of synthetic so we could be able to synthetic so that we could make the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions, "Can we start a chromosome synthetic synthetims?"
Something that is the chemistry to make this very great molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, a chromosome called ""Is"
One chemical is only a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of digitizing the digitize of life is acceed,
Our capacity to write the genetic code, but including it rather sheed.
And our last point would put it at the point would place at an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of stage, to start with a bio-ethical top, for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of mistakes are more mistakes of thouts.
So we had to put a new method of these little method of these little pieces and the corrigating of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus virus that dead.
We designed the pieces, did the mistake,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting of chemical stops, and the bacteria of chemical code, and the bacteria closing genetic code, and viral particles were making viral particles to make it.
The viral particles were disconcted from the cells, they came back and dead, they came back and dead, the E. coli.
I was a recently conversation with the oil industry, and I said them that model just too good unny foot --
They laughts more than you.
So we think this is a situation in which is a situation in the software own hardware own in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic co.
So we decided to build them in cassettles, so that we could virus, so that we could variate the cassettles, so we could varies, so that we could varieve ...
to go to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that needs to be digital information of it to be very accurable.
When we first first three this genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard precision is a per 10,000 basevices.
And finally, we found the resequencing 30 mistakes of the original sequence was not able to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start and start to start to start to start to start to start the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that have to be 50 letters that need to consider 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they can design so that they can go to design so that they can go to design so that they can go together.
We designing here unique unique of this.
Maybe you read water that we stop water in stop.
There is this: We have a four-genetic code: A, C, Greened, T.
Trios of those letters coders for spent coders for spent 20 aminosources -- that there is a long realization.
So we can use the genetic code, and we thought.
And in the cigatored of counter.
Some of them were teleurges that there were no poems were not poems
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repairs and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of it, and start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long and you have piece of 24,000 letters, and then you have piece from 24,000 letter, to 72,000 letters, to 72,00000.
In each stadium being a confluence of these pieces so we could sequence them to sequence a process that we could create a process that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be sequence.
We try to reach the point of automatic.
So this looks like a basketball of a ball crow.
Once we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basevices -- then they don't grow up in E. cost, they don't grow in E.
That really, it governmental tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologe recombination, that gets used by the biology to repairs to repairs that pieces together can add a piece of the DNA can feet.
Here is an example of it.
There is an organism named Deinococcus radio durans that three million rad radiation to can.
You see that in the top panel, she clear chromosome of the chromosome of the critical cle.
12 hours later, he put it into each other, it was the weather there was a precisely as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely have been dried up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can find in space that can find it into a new aquatic environment.
NASA has showed by the way, there's a lot of this, there.
Here's a real microphone of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually yesterday, with just yesterday, with only yesterday, with the right design of the pieces that we were in it.
Good makes a concerny automatically conceive.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a non-microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we expect inside of the publication that we have recently been inside.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule went is over 300 million.
If we should be printing with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages of pages only to present the genetic code.
Well, how do we start a chromosome, how do we act it? How do we activate?
With a virus is clearly clearly easy.
With a bacterium is a lot of complicated.
It's also simple, simple, if you take under the cell of eukaryots, as you just the cell cell number of cell and that's what you know if it clothing.
In the bacteria of the bacteria of integrated in the cell in the cell and we have showed a full transplantation of a chromosome of the cell transplantation of a chromosome of the cell to another, and it can activate.
We have a chromosome of the souivered of a microbs.
These are about so far of each other as people and mice.
We add some extra genes that we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the extra genes of the extra genes of the chromosome extra genes that we could select to be a chromosome extra genes of extra chromosome extra genes of extra chromosome extra genes to select the chromosome extra genes to select the chromosom.
We have the enterms of enzyms to make all the protein and make all the protein and
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you'll be the very advanced graphic images here, and the very advanced -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to be wonder, but we were trying to develop the process of what farther further from develop.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of course, we have all realized a second chromosome, or a third of thousands of properties in one times of thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who have evolution evolution to change ever any of a lot of biology have been crazy.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that actually realized DNA real.
The chromosome that was not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever evies.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop in it -- well.
It was expressed, and it recognized the other chromosome of the other chromosome of the strange of the cell of the cell of the cell with the new chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell with the cell of the cel
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the species of the characteristics of the new species, and changed on the new kind of based on the new software that we had stopped in the cell that we had stopped in the cell of the characteristics of the cell of the characteristics of the characteristics of the characteristics of all the characteristics of the characterribal characteristics of the cell in a very short of the ch
All the protein changes, the membrans -- when we change the genetic code, it was changed.
This is a may be critical alchemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change things fundamentally change things fundamentally change.
All of the Camble that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have paid evolution, and I have paid that we might have been taking a new version of the Camble explosion of the Camble of distance, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to go from six-and-half to billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context plate-born in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet;
for each of us who lived in 1946, in 40 years will be that there will be four four.
We have a difficult with food, with critical water, medics, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuell a half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine to do that for nine e.
We use five billion tons of college, more than 30 billion five billion of five billion of collecture.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
When we have biological processes in eyellow or any process than any process to replace that; then that a huge challenge challenge.
Then of course, there is all these carbon dioxide of the sense that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is that coming into the atmosphere is that coming into the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming into the atmosphere is coming carbon in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosp
And through all of our global discoveries have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozens of components, and look at the diversity that comes out of the diversity that is coming out of that.
We are mainly limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have this techniques of thanks quickly synthesemethods to do so-called combination genomics."
We have the capacity to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the processing of 20 million different genes, or trying to optimize octan, to optimize octan, new vaccines, new vaccines, new vaccines, we can change a little team of team biology than we do a little team of the science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design is that we work on the computer that we work on the way that we work on the common and a new kind of the way to design a new kind of the way to design a new kind of the computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of it.
We focus on the fourth generation fuel.
One of you have seen ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have two-third generation fuels will come from the third generation will come from the inside of sugar, as more higher fuels like octan, or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence the food price without of food price higher and the available to reduce the food prices that we start with CO2 as his food supply that we have been concerned to design the first of fourth generation that we can fix fuel fuels within about 18 months of fix.
Slight and CO2 is method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half mile, about 2.5 miles, with cooking, it called temperature in the deep sea half miles.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the point we can take CO2 -- which is easy easy through picks to be transmitted to factories, where that CO2 is back to the fuel of fuel that that will be realized to the fuel thing.
So in a short time we think that we are able to break out of the basic question is: "What is life?"
We realized the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, what?
One important energy source to be a major
But we also have to use these tools to use these tools to concerns series of vaccines to be vaccines
This year was flu -- we always walking something behind the facts when it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by combined vaccinated vaccines.
So here you see how the future can see how the future of evolution that the evolution tree is going to change with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually eventually evolukaryota.
We are far away from the improvement of the improvement.
Our goal is to assure, to sure that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that may be doing that may be making a chance to do that may be made a chance to survive that we make a chance of survive. Thank you very much.
What I first want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to a consider to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedraw.
And it's a environment in which you can work on immense with immense amounts of visual data can work of visual data can work of visual data can work of visual data can work of visual data can work of visual data can work or on the distand,
We look at this here many gigabytes to digital images and can be able to keep in the several images and may be the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of our wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look around how large these collections or images or pictures or pictures or pictures or pictures or picture.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel of the Library or Congress.
It all doesn't matter of anything because the only thing would influence influence of the screen system, the amount of pixels on the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen that would be in the screen of the screen of the screen that would be influence.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, an example of non-image data.
This is a graude of Dickens. Every single colum is a chapter.
So to prove that it's really text text, and no picture, and we can't do something like that, to show you something that this is really text picture.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read an e-book.
I wouldn't refire.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a picture of the bottom of a part.
This is the fun, and the experience of a real paper magazine, magazine, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also have done with the corner of this excited of the Guardian.
We have made a nine advertised of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertised. And we have extra information information information in the right.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of across the screen through the screen of the screen through the screen of the screen through the screen that we can really do this.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other flaure, not will be able -- not needed more now -- not needed more now -- not need.
Of course, a country to application for a technology as this, I won't spending a technology of this, I won't spending this field, except that we can contributed this field.
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And placed on the top of an image of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which is two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and it's other is a very nice of computer vision of Washington, profound the University of Washington, proventure the University of Washington, led by Steve Steve on U.Washington,
and Rick Smyseliski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images of the images of the images here.
The computer vision of algorithms have been broads, so that they get the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- the Grassi -- where they genome area of diasshows or panorama and panora ama and panora panorama and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is a time there is, other environments.
There are more space there are more space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data setting -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth -- to the communicate that we work in my head is actually real power of this technique, in the real power of this techniques of the environments of the environments on our websites on our websituatibsites on our websites on our website.
We had to go and calculation with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Noe Day with images from Flickr. You just just just Setry in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and campus and so the campus and so the campus and so campus and so such the campus and so much as like that.
And every one of these orange keygoles a picture that would be part of this model of this model of this model of model.
And so all of Flickr images, which are all built in this way of each that are spaced.
And we can navigate at simple point.
You know, I had never thought I would have thought I would ever work at Microsoft in Microsoft
It's overwhelming here.
I believe that these are typicky, many type of cameras everything from gleft to mirroflexcameras, a big number of it.
I'll try to find some strange picture.
There are so many covered by faces, and so so so much of the face and such
Somewhere between is even a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Noe Delebrity is also good for the program.
If we dive through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we really want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the object looks at the point, the Earth looks of it looks at each other.
All these pictures are encounter, and shapes a little bit larger than the substance,
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the Earth.
Sephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use, and also the benefits grows for the people who use it.
Their photographs are being metaphorrificious data that somebody else
If somebody would want to attack all of these sacks, and their names, and then my photograph of the Notre Dell Day, and I can use all of all of that data, and I can use as a access to that space, using anybody verse, used of everybody else to be a kind of crowdal, and creating this kind of crow-modal, and social experience.
And of course, is the by-product put of this immense virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who didn't only photographs, satellites and other applications is disred of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all images that are shared by everybody on the world can get together?
BAAA: Yes. What this really doing is discovered.
The create, to your wish wish between images.
And it doesn't do that in the picture.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you go to the web and search for images, you get a search of a search of information and the text on the webpage of information about what the image of the image of the picture of the image resources of the image represents of information about the image of images, you get a pick up the pictures, you get a pictures, and the text of the picture, and the text of the pictures, and the texty of the web, and the basina lot of ina lot of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of ina lot of ina lot of ina lot of ina ft of ina lot of ina lot of information of the pic
What if now that picture, is to all of your imagination?
And then the number of the understanding semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from the number of wealthy that comes from the classical networks.
CA: Blaise, that's real unbelievable.
One of the intense far research research is the possibility to live between they're not forgotten between they're not enough to forget their past forgotten their past in the wind, and they were still their police in reflection, the profitters of the police of resources.
The science that Jaguar-still that Jaguard still War the myths of In, or that the myths of In, or that the myths of In, or that the Himalaya bood's still of the bood's bood's still remember on the breath, remember of the anthropology of the anthropology of the anthropology of the anthropolic: but it's a model of the world of the world is not a model of the worse of the working of the working of the world, but one,
the consequence of a fairly adaptation choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same adaptting the same reak: Worls born in children in the world.
We all make increase thrites.
Because the infline of distinctions three of the dead.
So it can't be surprise that we sing; dancing and arts and art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is about the Penan in the forest of Borneo, or the Voo--bollight acollight in the Kaisut-World in North Kaisut-Warch in North Kenya, the Carai in the Carai in the heart of the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- this is the man with the deseri, a month of Qeaker -- or now a momenta moment,

They all learn us to be able to think different, differently, differently, otherwise can originate orient.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a little bit of hope.
Shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life is as important as the biosphere.
This cultural life-web you can imagine as a eat.
The eath nohere you can defining the eating of all the thoughtal thoughts, mything, mythes, ideas intuitions that are intuitions that are put by the human imagination that are put by the beginning of our consciousness.
The eath nosphere is the big nalatence.
She is the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be a surprise that we can be amazing curious species.
like the biosphere is slide of sham is the eating of the foot that is -- and in many bigger mate.
No biologist would be during to extinction that extinction extinction of extinction that simply is not true.
And right now, the most apocalyptical scenario is not even in the most optimic scenario for cultural optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is losing on the lands.
And then everybody here was born born was born there six, there were six-thousand languages on Earth.
A language is more than a tal words, or her grammatic regular.
A language is a cflick of the human soul.
It's the vehicle, that the soul of every unique culture the material world is reached the material world to reach the material world to reach unique of every unique culture of every unique culture the material world that reaches the material world that reaches the material world that reaches the material world that
Every language is an eternal mind a separation, a separation, a thought, a ecosystem of an ecosystem spiritual possibility.
From that six-thousand languages today is not fluences in children flustend.
They are not learned babies farned babies of it.
Effective means that means a change optreed, that they already death,

People that is somebody's benard up every two weeks of the every two weeks in somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks die, an old and with him the last letter-field.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't be better if we were all the same language if we should all be speak?" I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba -- Or Kantone."
Or Kogi." you will realize you realize how it would not be able to speak to your own language
So what I want to do today is taking you on a short journey to sketch, which has to be lost a picture of what in fact, in fact,
Many of us forgotten that when I talk about a different way of being a different way of being very other ways.
For example, this Barasana child in the North west-Amazon, the people, the pack of the anaconda, that believes the melky critics on the east, in the pile, in the policy of the east, in the political snaky.
This is a people, cognitive the colors blue and not green and green because it wonderful, because it of the heavy of the skin the melectric of the equal mistake.
They have a square of called language of marriage regular exogamy is called somebody who is called somebody who is a different language that speak a different language.
This has his roots in the mythological past but the particular full in their house, where six or seven languages are spoken by these crows of whether or seven languages -- but never to anybody a language of thing.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinated tribes that I lived the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a amazing people, a naily contact was contact to the phabitat.
In 1957 missionaries, five missionaries, but they made a critical pholt.
And then they were through photographs of photographs of themselves with friendly friendly getting a two-dimensional image -- that this had never seen a two-dimensional picture.
They were pictures and tried to find the form behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the photographs and the form behind the photographs and then the form behind the photographs and tries.
When they didn't found anything that they were the duniversed with thumb, and then the missionaries, and then the missionaries, and then the missionary were through the missionaries.
But the Waorani not only discuss not only outside of the outside of the obvious.

Foodoo is simply the destillased of this deplock religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora in the tragic diaspora at the tragic diaspora at the slavery,
What foodoo interesting is the living between the living and kills and death.
The living bars of bars the mind.
The mind of the mind-correctly of the Great Water, answered on the dance, which is the soul of the living time, so that during the soul of living time, so that during one that during the god.
And so why fooms say thank you say, "You go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you're so only through the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a blue-following tone: Foo-fools in trance that squarters global coal.
This is a tonation of the mind to influence the mind to influence the body of the mind when this is extask.
And of all the people that I have ever lived with the Kogi the most extraordinary -- a people of Colombia.

Now they are speaking in the lapse of the great mother.
These time are the society of the society that are reported to the cosmize that all the cosmic of the cosmic of the cosmic of ecological early or ecological early in the moment.
This increased with the day that they have learned to the day and for the first time they were to go out and be a sunswer in their life, if they are 18 sunsoped. At that clear point of the first light, if the Sun of the first light landscape with her light, oneyed in full glories, anything that they have learned to be abstract in full glory. The priesters say:
"See? It's like I said, "It's like I have said you.
And it's the real. It's real. It's about to you this is to call this stuff." They call himself the older brothers.
And we have the younger brothers, that are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And on this point is intuits intuition is very important.
If we think about indigenous people, and we get Rousseau and often the old fability to Rously wanted to be an idea that racistic is an idea that racistic in his simple.
Or we take it to take Thoreau and say these closer to the Earth than we die.
Innice people, nor are nor farming, nor by nostalgigic.
For both is very few space in the malaria moerass of the Asmat or in the icro-winds of Tibet. Desalennificantly through time and ritual mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mything, but on a lot of subtle, but on a much subtypically the idea that the Earth itself, because of the idea can imagine that the concept of the consciously giving the giving the ft of the Earth,
What does it mean? It means that a little child from the Andes, which is grown up with the mountain Apu-blic bits that will lead, a fundamental different of the moment will be a different relationship to that groundary of Montana, opposed to be a little kid of Montana, opposed to the idea that the mountain case of the course, ready to mine.
Or it the lives of a mind or a lot of of it is irrelevant.
Interestingly, the metaphor that defines the individual defines the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capital that these forests were capital.
That made me a different human than my friends of the Kwagiuth, who believe that those forests were believing the forests of Kuxewing place of the Hemel and the Kroms of the Hemel and the cannibal minminds that are in the north of the world's healthrough the north of the world.
These mind their minutes are important in their Hamatsa-inducation.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary discoveries. Now, take this plant. Let's take this plant.
It's a picture that I jump in the North west-Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuman making makes not only the fascinating is not only the farmacological potential of it. It's built up of two sources.
Enersion is there a wood, there is a woods, harmine and harmaline in itself, hearmine and light hallucinating works.
If you just take the plant of the plant of that a blue refus, it looks like this, and you consciousness through your drive.
The plant is mixed with leaders of a coffee becomes of a coffee being viridis.
The plant powers powerful tryptamines, naudicating to brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryltryptamine.
Do you ever seen Yanomami as they have seen that snuts, which substance substance of different species that have to do also yltryltryptamine --
That least your nose is a pooder of a become shots, as a scoped with barokay, to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not a distortion of the reality; it creates a disconcept of reality; it ships of reality;
I tried to my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince a man who discovered the psychedelic era discovered by his paddots in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean, these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect his in, because when the effect his involved to experience, there is no one more to experience the hallucination. Tryptamines of their effect being effect of enzym in the human dark in the human darmouth in the human darrooxida.
They can be only enoral to be enoral with something that the monoamine of the samine of the samine.
The fascinating is that the betable carbolines in the bottom of the gang, monoamine-suppression of the tryptamine activators are the question of the flora of 80,000 plants: How can this in a flora of 80,000 plantombs, which are two morfical variety of the parts of the parts that is bigger than the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the part?
We say euphical and say trial ror, which is becoming as meaningless.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, what does that mean? That mean? That means that mean? Cofomen's 17 variants of ayhuge distance of ayhuge distance of ayhuge distance of ayath.
If you ask their question of how they map, they say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
You know, you know, all the way doesn't have any it? I said "no."
And it turns out to all the 17 of all the 17 of the types in different full in different shows in different shows in different shows in different shows in different of the fults.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of booms of countly counter.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even the sympathy of indigenous people, and they have color, and curious and color, but reduced to a feetile of the history as the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, down.
The truth is that 20th century about 300 years is not remember to be remembered to the war or technological innovations, but earlier as the era in which we were still still in the mass of biological diversary and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem is not change.
All cultures have always been part of a dance with new life possibilities.
Techtechnology is not the problem.
The Siously indians not Sioux, when they gave their pile, when they gave their pile, as the Americans Americans Americans when Americans were stops to be Americans when they gave their purpose their purpose and wear.
It's not change or technology that technology that the integrity of the eatory of the eator.
The crue of government.
Where you look in the world, you will notice that it's not the lock of these cultures, to disappear.
These are dynamic living people, whose existence, becomes from identified powers that are being fore their adaptation powers that are reach of their adaptation.
Or this is the enormous deforestation in the home land of the Penan, a nomadical South Asian eyast-generation in the forest of the generation in the forest of the forest and now reduced to the service of the reverss, where you can see that the rivers, where you can see that the rivers of Bornever seeing half of the Bornee to the South Come for Chinese South Teap to Chinese squarter where Japanisian.
to fill their ships of fill in the forest.
In the Yanomami are the disease of the Yanomami are making his inside as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government of political government.
Genocide, the physical exciting of a population is convicted universal conviction, but eventor of the living of a people, not only not only convicted not only divided as a part of development of a development of development farea.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain Tibet is not to the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I have a young collega 9,000 miles about country of Chengdu in West China to Lhasa.
And I was when I got in Lhasa was called the face behind the statistics where you hear about it.
Sixty monuments destroy 1.2 million people in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was been known to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis of that he was directly killed when the Chinvasion started.
His ome understanding the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which people to Nepal broad.
His mother was prisonered prisoned because she was rich rich
He was the prisoner's prisoned when he was two and he was hidden under her roke, because she didn't without and without and they didn't without and he couldn't without and he was a bit of the prisone.
The sister that was so heroic fields in a food, in a food camp.
One day stack a day of Mao. For this poorband of them was showing it for seven years of she was seven years of showed seven years of source.
The pain of Tibet can be unwheard, but the free of the people, is something to critical mind is something to clamp.
And finally, it comes up doing a choice.
Do we have we in a gray world of simply life or want to be a colorrice world of diversity about diversity of diversity --
The great anthropologe Mead said she was a few that she feed fear that she feed peace, the worldview of the worldview move.
We wouldn't only see the human imagination are being model, modal framework, and we would wake a lot of framework, and forget that there are other options of options that there are other options of the options that there are other options that there are other optimes.
We can feel us feel in the idea that our species of the idea that our species of the idea that our species.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our far, where we gave us far, when we gave us the cult of the seed, when the point of the shaman was replaced by the prozors and we shared a thousand years ago, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface of this surface history doesn't give me the idea that we have all answers to all the answers of the questions, that will have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked the meaning of human beings are asked with 10,000 different voices.
And it is that song that we will discover again, we will discover to be what we are, a folbeing what we are, a folbeing everything in the work of all the garbages and all the garbages. There are great. There are great.
This picture I have been on the northern point of Baffin Island when I went to the Interm was on narrate.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inter, they were to fattack our souldn't have been placed to figure our soccasions.
The opa of Olayuk reflect.
The family of his life for his life, and he took him already weapons, all his tools --
Now you have to understand that the Infrom not frightening for the coll; they made it use.
The gline of their key became order to originally made of fish in charibooms of fish in charibooms.
Olayuks opa wasn't open for the polar or the storm that wrain,
He went out out of the skin his bag skin and put it out of skin his hand. Ten the poop, and then he started it as a lead.
He brought a low-eggle on the side of the side of the mess.
When it solid was slaught a dog.
He did flated the dog and improvised a harnas.
From the ribs of the rible basically, he made a slead.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice foops.
Over so, nothing around with nothing around this, in many way, a lot of symbol for the weather of the indistance of the indication in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government of the entire before the Interview of a country larger than California and Texas Texas we have new through the home.
It's independence. They were all the resources of the resources.
It's a native example of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of the nation of how a nation of the nation of the nation of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation state example of how a nation of how a nation state example of how a nation state enough people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly clearly -- at least for who's hits of the world, that they actually didn't get away away from the world is not very much more than that.
They are somebody else land.
They are standing of the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us, as the dreams of these children, as that are of the unctic geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is except the idea that politicians never reach something that politicians never to do something that politicians never to do something that politicians never to do something that politicians never to do something that politicians never to do something that politicians never to do something that eventually never reach to the end.
We think that polemic, we think that a millions of telling that stories can change the world, but we believe that stories can change the world, which we probably the best stories that are the best stories in the world, Our website is 35 million times a month of countries a millions of countries on TV and our magazy a millions of public.
We make a fell fielvated to the eat, with our audience, to the audience, to be realize cultural places, where the real realized by what he sees hopefully what he sees hopefully every one of the main opening opently opentilization of the anthropology will go into a way to live a way to live a multural plure in a multural pluralistic world, and we can find a way to live in a multural pluralistic world, and
where all the wisdom of all the people, can contribute to us be.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question of which I have dedicated a book of questions.
Maybe you see parallels to other sources of other sources.
I also try to explain some sense of the way that you may have mistic.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be precisely -- the official dogma of all western westersis, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows the same of our citizens on the highest level, we have to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a essential part of the human existence.
And then, by accumultiply us to accumbing to own insight, to reach a higher prosperating a higher prosperately without of this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom that people have more freedom
And more freedom means more freedom more prosperatically prosperate.
This is so deep in our society in our society would take a drive of the society.
Except in our lives is a dogma say basically.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle big.
So to do about thressing.
Now, the 175 can-hand-ressings are in my supermarket that have been doing in my supermarket virgin extra-virgin oil and different balso.
And that you can make the number of dressings own dressings that case 175 types that you don't have anything about 175 types of you have nothing about it.
So that's the forbunch of my supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics you can imagine stroneoset of your stereoset -- luidpower, cassetttespuler, cassetttespecier.
In fact, if you can pick on the electronics you can pick out of this tune language.
You can be six-half million different systems, with parts of the parts of parts of the shop.
Give to -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could have all kinds of phone, you could all kinds of phone, but only at Ma Bell.
You won't be able to walk it out. You don't bought it.
That had the front of it was advantage that it was never going to be piece of it.
That time is pretty.
Today, there are a lot of different state.
Everything in cell phones is the diversity.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with middle mid-rop, right noses per and crer crer and crer crer and crsick up with a breakful.
Wellight you have this model in the store, but you can sure that that that happened, but you can sure that that that happened.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the question of that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a cell that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attack of stuff, is this explosive increase of choices is a fact.
Gealth care, and it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not that you go to the doctor, and that you tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do that, we can do that, or we can do it.
And there's some of this fore;
And the piece of this forever and downt?"
And you say, "Doh, what does do you fin?"
And the doctor says, "Any has this fore-body and the way has this fore-and then downside.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you know, I don't am anyway."
And we call that we call called "own inbring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means that the swer task of decision of decision of the correcipath of things -- the doctor, to a certain shift -- to a certain sick of certainly disease, and not the best condition to take a lot of resources are measuring a lot of recipe that is becoming made, a lot of resources are being made,
Good scale, that is that nershows up, because the purpo, you can't buy it.
Why they can't buy again, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we go to the next morning our doctor to ask to ask that other brand ask to other brand medicine.
Our identity, yet a common aspect of us existence, is now confront of choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is to real result of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want to be able to do it.
Every morning at the opposition to be thinking what for person you want to be to be thinking for person.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that failed everybody else that you can possible out of that way, and then you can possible kids as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as farms as possible,
The only real choice, not when you did was not when you did and what you were doing did.
Now is a freeting everything for the opports.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, which I developed 20 percent less house work less house.
They are not dom, if you were in the mber time.
No, they have a pressure with choices.
"Well, I marry or now? Well, I marrief now?
Or I will I wait? Now, I will wait? Now, first children, or a career or a career?"
These are all being so.
They go through to them, also if this means they don't get answer to get them homework on their homework and there'd not get a good number of number of their eyes.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave to work. Carl gave that technology is able to work every minute every day, where the world -- except in the world, except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is a farming place, which WiFi the does.
I don't reality, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice of work like that we go and whether we go and whether we go and work on times on time, whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a football went from our son, with our cell phone, with our cell phone, and our Blacberry on the other hand, and we may be our laptop of school.
And even if they all get out of standing every minute of that competition with all kinds of questions, "Well, I have I remember this phone callon?
Well, if you go on this emailt respons? Well, I write this letter --
And even if the answer is "Nee," we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
Where we look at it, the big, the group of materialistic bags, life is a question of lifestyles.
And so the world early looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad.
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about what is bad about it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on human being.
One very opposed is that the paralyzed before than completely than companied.
With so many choices are finding the choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigation in volunteer of investments in volunteer plans.
A colleague of me got access to investment data of of Vanguard, a big police of policy society of employees of spread work about 2,000 vestments.
And she found that for every 10 political funds that work the work of the political two percent defence of the partly two percent of the primary two percent decided that for every 10 percent descrips that work the particular two percent deficians that are the participed two percent deficians that are able to do deficious
In fifty funds of fundred 10 percent less than five fundress. Why?
Because it in fifty funds funds of funds of fived, that people just touched the choice day, and that opened up there, and so on.
And of extince comes out of outside
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionating a dreg bread, because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money, but also that the choice was so difficult that they worked was working for the working for them shoot to shoot the work of shoot that did leave to shoot the work of eating that they have been working on a dream of eating eatory
And they walked to a 5,000 dollars a year on their nose before to go on their nose on their nose for this.
The workname, was namely to double their own contribute their own contribute
So Too many choice can work too much choice.
And I think the world of that looks like this.
If it goes the century goes, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be skeps with the wrong fund fund the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is also if we were the paralyshaking and eventually less tevily, less teval, and finally less text less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had less the paral.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, that can remaintain the back doesn't perfect.
You put you in such a case that would have been better would have been better to be better.
This was dream alternative working for it to be a spired of your choice.
And then breakfired to the fold of the choice that you have made -- even if it was a good choice.
The more options of the picture, it is to have easier to have a spired of understanding of the picture.
Second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
Then Gilbert gave from morning about how often we have the value of things that we get them to the value of the things that we compared with the value of the things that we compare.
If you can think of all alternatives and you can think of all of the alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you discus.
That makes you have less tevalence, with the alternative that you have chosice.
One example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excus.
This is such a little bit of the example.
This is a bit on vacation in the Hamptons.
They have a flashing.
They are beautiful beautiful beautiful again. No human beings in itself.
Don't be able to it? "Fordik" thinks that guy that guy that gusty.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city.
I could park my car for the door,
And he is there to simmy, with the idea that he was every day, with the idea that he is mislearned every day parking place.
Substitutic costs are going to be costs of our choice that we have from our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities, the more attractive alternatives are there.
And those presentation to us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This pictured of a number of points.
Life in here, and now that you don't have to be over, and you don't have to be over.
Another thing is that you have every choices of other choices.
And all of that other has been so been so many obvious option to less attractive to attractive less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this in my search for a new broek.
I always get a speech.
Well, it was only one kind of the broek, and it bough, and it bought you know, it was incredibly unbelievable, but if you were broke the broek of the broek and often the broek of the wast, felt it was every enough and often enough the room OK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That's my makes a speed broek, this is my make.
And the store said, "Well you fit easy fit easy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether a ritis? Do you know stand a weed?
Do you know a broken with shed substit?
Will you have something extinctimes, or flink to pick." And so he went down." And so he was only through it.
I was spokay, I was speaking a which, I said, "I want to be the only thing that was early early early who was ear."
He had no idea that was not a idea that was each of all of the possible broeks on all possible broken all the possible broke.
And I think of the store, I left the store ended up with a bit of a bit of passing passing broek.
I had better did better all of those possibilities, I could do it.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To explain this to myself out of this, I wrote a book one.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of this choice, was that I started more of the sance of the sness of the sness of a good speed.
I started without there was a single expectation, because I just know a kind of mush.
And then turned out there were different and one of them would be a bit of that would be perfectly be perfectly to be a bit of that,
What I bought was bough, but not perfect.
And so I ended up my broak with my broad, and that send me that picked me to the same teleur.
The more opportunities of people have more opportunities to be more than they expectations about the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people less tevalue with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketingpeople don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now --
In really the way it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was bad of couldn't surprising experiences.
In our modern society of we can expect as a citizens perfection, but the best thing we can reach that is something so good as we have been expected as we had ever expected as we had been expected as we had ever expected as a various of society as
We never become surprised to be surprised to be our expectation, my expectation, torent.
The secret of happiness -- you all have come to -- the secret of happiness is not too much of happiness is not too much fortunate.
I want to imagine -- I want to be a carry biographic elemental -- that I am with a woman who really is great.
I don't have a lot of text with less text.
But with less enough his good side.
And finally, whenever you have a bad bad bad of being bad as a bad books as one kind of a forehand, you can ask the questions why you unteve.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsible of this. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy a bit turns out to falling to fall?
The answer to that, just simple. That's you.
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different breaks you don't have an excuse to fail.
So if people decision, even if the results of those decisions of that decision, they are calling about their choice.
And they take themselves qualy.
In the western society of clinical depression under the younger generations high-generations of high-generations of high-generations of the western society of the western society of the western society,
One factor -- not the enious, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression of depression and self-myself, is that people have so often television of their high experience.
And if they try to exploration for themselves try to explore themselves the descip.
So the ntoresulate is that we spoken on the objective on the forward, but our bad of this, but our bad of this.
Another a conferency of the moment.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is taken by everybody to be taken to the so.
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't seem choose to choose better than not can choose better, but not entirely automatically choice that is better is more choice.
There is a magical foundary choice.
But I know that we already for long the point is that choice for a long time.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing that we can keep us the best of the best thing that we can keep us the best of the best of the best thing that we can do to be the best of the best thing to do to be the best thing to be best the best thing to be best best the best thing to be the best
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overfluns from material overfluning from material overfluns of material confluns of industrialized countries from material overflunessarily in the freedom of freedom in frontifically industrialized countries
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier to the problem isn't so much choice that there is too much choice is too much choice is too few of choice is that there is a lot of choice of the world, and there's a lot of places that there is a lot of places on the world, where the problem is not very mu
So the paradox I here talk about this, so with the frame, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,
That's frustrated, and I said to this, Steve Levitt you're yesterday, and did to install of installing children's not help, and sune of your money.
I say the same about this pthree, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help any y damage, they did damage.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of the society of these choices were being able to countries to where people have feel feel very few options of those people have gone on it.
Also, our lives would go on and go on and go on and go on and through it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-better.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- and that is not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choice that we have with our community.
