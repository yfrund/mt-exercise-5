Last year, I show this two dias to show that the police cap, which the past three million years that the last three million years of the size of the U.S. and the U.S. and in the U.S.
But this is actually the requires of this specific problem because it doesn't showed the disector.
The ice capacity is on the North Pole, in a certain sense,
It looks in the winter and crack in the summer.
The next slide, I leave is a version of what happened is 25 years of what happened 25 years of what happened 25 years of what happened the next 25 years of what happened is a fasted version of what happened is a fasted version of what happened is happened.
The permanen-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-inded in red.
As you see it from the dark to dark blue.
That's the year, it's the year, of the winter.
And it is crack in the summer.
The called ice, five years or five years or old in is almost like blood, that is almost like flowing the body is increating here.
In 25 years is the from this to this is going to this in 25 years of this is going to be going to be in 25 years of this is going to go to this in 25 years of this is going to be in 25 years of this is going to be in 25 years of this is going to be gone of this go.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozes around the Northern IJszee warms and there is a very great amount of fred carbon fred carbon or design, when it is designed by microbes in methan.
Well, the total hundred amount of reason in the atmosphere, that could close the amount of the atmosphere, if we can doubled the crite of the course.
In some increating indible indible in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Around the University went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska who's University of the University of understand undeep it out there.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is echer or we will be going to be
A reason that is that this enormous warmbron" Greenland from the northous warms.
This is a smeltwaterriver.
The water than ever is the full of the follower than ever ever ever ever the water than ever ever evolume is bigger than ever evolume is bigger than ever evolume is greater than ever evolume is the ful.
This is the Kangerls in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea piece of the sea because it is country because it is the place where it is comes in the sea place that it is the place in the sea lot of the sea lot of the sea lot of how the sea of the sea picture where it is the sea lot of the sea picture, it's the place where it is the sea prives in the sea.
These stroms are taking craft to be able to put them to the eedge.
On the other side of the planet, on the South pool, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And Afroundary crapported scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balans it is a negative ics.
More specific is the ice of the South police of the South Pole, with a feel very quickly underwaters with a few policy of the South poolands.
The whole continent is six meters of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice mass, there are new now, there are new now, there were new now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drags of that smell times.
In the Andes, is this glass the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more strows more stroms.
But when they disappears, it also does it also drops it drops the drinkwater.
In California was a field of 40 percent in the snow pack of the Sierra.
It's in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions of it.
This worldwide set of the global dramatical stycup.
And the number of natural around the world is cities with an incredible and never seen accidents.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at it from a historic context from a historic context what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 envirtually every 24 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic dragin, there is a drasted in the oceans.
The only major causes of the Earth, navily, which is designed for 20 percent money, is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stem is the greatest problem is the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extincluded with China.
And there was a presented to build a lot of more cool.
But we see a community.
These are the steps of the building was the building was annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives were presented to the last years.
There is a political striple of the gang in our country.
The steone of the stem of oil industry gave in 250 million dollars to promotly 250 million dollars to promots, which is a textily cleance.
And that picture to something like this.
And Rond the charest was home in Tennessee, about four billion liters of cools of cools cools of the course modder.
You probably have seen the news face.
This is the one-largest directly in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertise of the coolling left in the Kerstrial.
Video: "Frosty the cup, called Frosty is a bly, called a bit of this.
He's been flow in America, and he was flowing in America, and he grows on the economy.
Frosty the cities with the day cup, with the day sharter.
He's paid and cups and cups are holds to their bances their bances their bances and he is true their busines."
Here is a big comes a big part of the cool in West Virginia fiel.
The biggest mine of the country is the great bas of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship Blankship -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So has the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "Be COALergy, we see climate change as a serious as a serious threatened for our things.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantic to reclassociated to the light and the reason the light of the truth of truth and the truth of the truth of truth is about the truth of the truth of truth is about the truth and the reason the lig
Feits is not sal.
We think it's soon -- it's clean, it's still -- and it's clean.
So, you don't make a care about climate change.
Let me go on our govern.
Video: Acteur: Sup, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cities of cities clean cup.
Fantastic! The machines machines a lot of the machines a lot of the machines are best to the machines best fun.
But that's the sound of soundation cools of sounds.
And the despite of cities that burning is the most important causes of the earth is changing the earth is changing the remarkable creating is the remarkable creating in fact, the remarkable of the earth is changing to this.
Look around good around, this is the school technology of today.
Al Gore: Einqually, put the positive alternative alternative with our economic challenges and that on the area of national security of national security of national security and the area of national security and that on the area of national security of native alternative alternative
Video: America front in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The red wire of all these things is our dependence is our dependence of fossil fuels, like polluted oil, as fiile and inported oil.
But now there is a conversation of this, new solution to this.
America of 100 percent clean electricity, in 10 years.
A plan America to get America work again, a plan that we have been taking us to make the Earth counter, and the warming of the Earth counter.
Einally, a solution that is required to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ont-decise.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It's about it comes America is to give again.
One of the fastest ways to our equating and making them on our dependence of old fuel of old fiels that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good paid to create a jobs of creating jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old Africans says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go far, good."
We need to go far and speed.
Thank you.
Last year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hope about how it works.
So here I have the ones that there were not one who weren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment in the grandoms, 27 kilometers.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion a billiance of billiance to 600 million times a billion times a seconds.
Enorm ambitions, though ambit!
This is the machine underGeneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Bangs inside detectors of the minial that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in continuous photograin
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That care that a feestystinction in the controllect amered.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that all the LHC and with operated the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is that called LHC, which is in detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September knew that the machine worked on the machine works, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest biggest of the biggest of this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internetpage.
That means we have a both of a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden well.
That drags 13 thousand amper red ago, the machine on fully the power on ful.
The engineers are going to say, "No true. It's too little tiny tiny tiny small of you will say, "No small the small of you will say, "No true.
They can do that because they can do superty because they are superature on whole low temperaturs.
So on min 271 grades between the space between the space between the gars, that can read it become flowing between the glows that before the strengineering between the gars, colder between the gars,
In one of the constructions between the necs in the LHC, and it was a constructive.
And that was the wirelectrically something was there and it was increating electrically against that 13 thousand amps of amper resource.
This was the result.
This is another inpressive when you realized that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets more than 20 centimeters they were inches 30 centimeters were place.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of them, what we did we did.
We all have been reached to have them all tool.
Now they're going back away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will continue again, and we expect measures in Junli, so that we can go to the build of the universe.
Now, natural have started to have increate the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be hard to be hard to go into the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was dedefined to the valuable experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous to take the progress of human spirit of the human mind to take our images of the human being in natural that are completely in natural our being science in nature, and they are comple, and we are compleavel that we have been design, and that are that they are to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the reagainsized that is not have been definitimay
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your kids to your kids played with block with block of block with block to your kids played to get to your kids to go back to your kids to your kids played with you.
When you discovered how to figure out to understand and and consciously away, you actually solve to learn by the resides with the depended by the real relations of space and hand-fritics
Ruimphramms insight is strong because with the world to understand the world to understand us.
If a information information -- inspired by the native of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advisore of course, Jeeeee of Kalanithi -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer to use a kind of common a set of digital vingeral vingerable to set up a plate with a soccubred with a soccubred with a plate with a plate with a soceatory so.
and can we be able to be orders as we want to lea?
This question of us so decided to search that we decided to search a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort sages is a Sifable is a Sifable a interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be able to get up with the hand they can feel each other, they can feel each other, and they can contact a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be able to be able to understand through it can be able to understand it.
Bovendis are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
That's the resource of these resources are a more physical difference, and even of their movement and even of the way we have to move them movement, and even of the way we leave them different new and figure interactions of the interactions of the way we are profound new and fun.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sifable is instimages to show a video core to change a video certain and otherness and otherness and otherness to be a video game back and others of other.
These interactive portraits are conscious portraits of each other.
Indis next together, they will interesting each other.
If they get up, they can be remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be certain countern.
And they feel again, they feel and helling.
We realized algaum that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of all of this interesting of the interesting of a color was a color was a color was a slideistry and a so.
In this example three Siftables of Siftables and I can use them to use color in a leg, where they are invitious to go colored and I can use them to go collect colored
If we have threspons, we good what we do is going to be back.
There are some of critics for education, presented education, pretty play with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things to try fast, and the result of the education, and it result.
Here I ton -- this is the development of a Fibonacci frequires by a simple crown.
Here we tonens a play that is a crows between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter letter to every Siftable, and freed in a words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is about 30 seconds it is very results and different a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I love it to try it out out to make it out out of it.
They were really really, very road from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these pieces of this passing is that people needed to be instructions of the most interesting things needed to have instructions of this piece.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know exact what they need to do is to do it.
Here are some other people to the other people on the test.
That's our young benefits of the right benefits of the right benefits of the right born.
And it looks like it to just the Sift of the Sift of stack.
For him was just blocks.
Here is an interactive paintingly picture.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can crazy new characters in the scene, by just the Sift with that character of the table.
Here he is coming the sun coming up the sun right here.
Video: The Sun's coming up.
David Merrill: No has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done through go! Yeah!
And by shape of Siftables and the next to each other, he can leave the characters with each other, he can response -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story of them.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a story of opend.
and he decision how it decision of the decision and he decisions.
Video: The catair.
DM: The last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed every Siftables a sound product a sound product and drum.
Eenious variations that you can choose ears where you can use to choose you want to use it.
These happened in leads can be injected in Siftables so you can detern to pattern to pattern them.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a legal Sifable effects that are live controllabably available of the reasonable effects and filter.
They are involved to a sound and shiped by can.
Anore the general effects like tempo and volume that are passed on the whole pattern
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftables, to a very first pattern by a extra lead.
Now I place the based based in the based
Video: Now I feed some slaggwork on a little bit work.
Video: And now I call the filter on the filter on the drums, so I can influence.
Video: I can accelerating the obvious can't certain the block of the block you.
Video: Now I call the movie to the filter on the basically is for a little expression.
Video: I can re-hold it played as it played played as it plays.
I don't have to have to figure out everything to plann, but I can improvisers, it really being a lower and shorters like I want.
And with the end, the dembly dims of the volume to set up the left Siftly to set up the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of making new people, and then we can get to make new people, which are better interfaces that are better interfaces our brains work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of course to show you a few possibilities that we developed in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that I want to talk about is that this is the attack is to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hear.
I look at it to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you to you all and talk to you and talk to you
I'm writers.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm going to be able to change and I don't think that ever will change that will change that ever change.
And yet there is unless there is underneath in my life, and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work again.
And it started a book that I did understanding on a book I wrote a memoire, "Ets, Biinnen," that is very in the entire work on to my honestly work on the whole work about the world and a international exister was the whole work on the world and a international design.
The consequences that people are all all over time, and always have to be damness.
World to what -- -- you know, gott!
People come to me and ask me and asked me and asked to me, "Ben you don't you to be able to equalive, you never ever equality to be equal?
Don't you know, you don't have to be your whole your life write write is going to be a book more of course, where people will be walk to warm and become from?
You don't you get there?"
Ery read, you know, you know.
Nature, that would be very much that would be able to be a teenam 20 years ago, I was when I was a teenager -- if I was writing I write that I wanted to be write that I wrote to be write 20 years ago.
People said, "Ben you don't have to be that you're never going to get success?
Don't you know, you don't have to go on through to reach through it do?
You don't you afrather afrather you're going to be able to go without of this work without that it is something from your broken and you will strong on your broken on the puin your broken with your broken bitters of fail?"
Something in that streaking.
In the short comes to the questions of this questions that question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that becoming things becoming to be called things that becoming things becoming in.
Eval.
But I'm also a lot of other things that is all about this, you don't know that all of it.
For sea bit of sea bit and other entire things.
But what it is write write to myself the last time that feel comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be able to be able to work for the work for the work for their work for earth of earth on Earth are they put to their hit?
What is so basically increative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the minds, something that is not happened to happen to be a kind of work all of the way that is not happened to be able to do the effects of creative processes that we can make us to make the effects of creative processes of the
Take my father. He was shift to engineer, and I can't remember that there was a in the 40 years that he has been asked in the 40 years that he didn't have any to be able to remember there was a bang for it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so was not about it.
And to be fair to be fairly engineers have been through the centuries, not the reputation of pieced piece of manicicians are depressive alcolists.
Scharriters wonder, that have reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have reputation to be instable.
Look at the grimble dodential under the most magnifical creative mind the 20th century.
Many of stiped young, often by own own own through own own through own own through own own through own time.
And even those who don't have a self-moord placeas, under their gave eyet to be concerned to be considered to be considered to be considered to be a self-moord fields, even under their gave behind theselves that don't have a self-moord business moders not to be a self-moor
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meach of my books is a piece of miself."
That's a pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of except spoke to look at it.
We all have heard all before and have heard it all before all accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is involutioned is underconnected to line and that an artist-best, and that will lead to eventually include.
And so I want to ask everybody here today, you can question: you can live with that idea that idea life?
Do you know, OK?
I think now about it now I think about it all all the way I don't think about it all all the way to be right though.
I think it referening it again.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century is so well.
We can creative mind a lot of better in.
I know it would be able to me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be dangerous to live to that dark in the area of thought life.
Sean, the fase where my career in which my career now is now in.
Go only after, I'm still young, amper every year.
I may be a four decades of four decades --
Home probably will be everything I'll seen the outside world as the world as the world as the work that outside on that outside outside of the extraordinary book.
We're friends with friends each other, so I can claps: higher probably lights my biggest successary behind me.
Jig, what a idea!
If you think about that, you're thinking about the morning to need against hours to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to go to that.
I love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work of wood.
The question is: "Hu?"
And after long after long after the conclusion that I can only go through with write when I went to a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a safe distance safe and creating between me, and my overwhole is very understand my overwhole for the reactions of the reactions on my future publics.
I have been set up in the last year, to do that.
I have been doing in history and have represents me deep in other societies to see if others have found to see a better way to help creative people to try creative people to go to try creative process.
My search has been brained to me, at the old Greeks and Romines.
Let op, because it's a long and complicated story.
In time of the old Greeks and Romins and Rominen believed people don't believe that creativity was going to be able to hundred out of itself.
And so people believed that creativity was a good particularly far, unknowledge to human being to human being and unknow.
The Greeks called these basically spirit of creativity "demonen."
And also Socrates believed that he had a demoon who had been influistered in the words influistered in the fluister.
The Romeins had a kind of right idea.
And in fact, such called a called creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their policy was a genius a kind of magical entities that are opped in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists work was working for the genius.
And he gave it works on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise I had the first time I had the first about the psychological protection of your work.
Everybody knew that in his work is going to be work in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection called the artists for example,
If you work brilliant that you came out there you came out of the equate.
Everybody knew that you had a unseem that a unseem that you had hold on it.
Word you work on the work on you, it doesn't just on you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather unused genius.
Long time is that in the Westen creativity was how in the Westen creativity was considered to be creative.
Then came the Renaissance, and everything changed it changed.
There is a very new idea of new idea of the individual human is the resource of the universe and mysterious point and mysterious and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures from the godnore of the godnamed world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity came out of the individual filled came out of the individual came out of the individual fun.
And for the first time, in history was about artists artists said that they had said that they had a genius.
I need to say that I have to be a big failed.
On one person, one person, one person, one individual individual huge individual human being the equire, the essentially mystery, of everything is to a lot of the equive, creative and it is something that is to a lot of responsibility for a fragial psyche.
And, as if you ask somebody ask in clicks.
Egos are representions to gigantic proportions and there are increated increated to prestations of prestations of prestations that experience.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists of artists made a lot of artists made a lot of artists made a lot of artists in the last 500 years of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists that this pressure is the last 500 years of artists of artists that this pressure has made
And if it is, and I think, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older understanding of the relationship between the human being and creative mysterious?
Maybe not maybe not
Wellight we can 500 years of rational humanism not make increated in a 18 minutes of through in a 18 minutes of through in a 18 minutes of the real humanism of the right of the real humanism not speech.
Probably they're in the audience of the audience of scientific desible developed the idea that evil foods, with some feed-set of artists with some artists to inspiring artists of artists of artists and the work of artists
It doesn't seem to me, I will get you in that in you.
And yet I won't ask me it up.
Why no?
Why would we have thought that thought that though?
The soon is just so much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totality that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, in fact, you know, -- you know, the creative process of the creative process is not always wonderful rational process.
And it sometimes it can feel like almost paranoral.
I've been understand the great American dial American close Ruth Stone of the great American core of closes the great American director.
She is close in the next of the negentic writers they directly close.
She told me about her jeuggged on the platattel of Virginia.
Somes, if she was work on the work was working on the work she was close, she feel like the close.
It was, so said, so, if there was a big golf air, and it was like this,
Sun close gold about the country to her her the country to her it.
She feel that the ground, under her foot started to shape and knew that her on that point her to do its only one thing that is to state her life.
And she went home, back by the entered and she had to go and see them to possible and picks.
When it was close by her her her waves that her only came to writer the only of her observe.
Sometimes she wasn't need.
Then showing and rin, but it doesn't reach the house.
And in such moments it close to her her set by her her -- in her words on the fields, in her words -- in her another director.
And also we have a lot of the story -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they have the close to almost mist.
And then she was in house on looking for home and pick it by her and poem it by her it.
Juist on that point had she had a pencide a pencil on that point.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me she was close to the air.
She packed it into his straight at his staria, and it back in her body in her body written the she wrote the written and wrote it again.
In those cases came up with that cases close close of pieced pieced followed in punder, but then in the follow.
When I was heard that heard -- what happened to be able to be my creative process.
That's what my creative process is not works at all! I'm not medium!
I'm a musion that every day on the same time, which is the same time, and swer with flowing and trans with flowing and trans it becomes a become.
But even in that day equired I had a little experience of experience.
You're also farming it is also felt that there are creative ideas in your broidentify out of a source that you can can impossible.
What is that bread?
How can we use it without that without we are being it?
One a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a perfect of year.
We had the desire to this.
And in fact, a big part of his life is a big part of his life is cloaded of the amazing artists that protect to get increative impults that proves in the uncontrols that increative impults that including him.
With the 1990s was Tom what was clear amazing questier.
And on a day he read in Los Angeles about the speeaway, and changed the process of radical radical rese.
And as he was so required to heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that fake, ungranted, ungratitured to the crable of him,
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to be furting.
But it wasn't that it.
He had no paper too, not a tany put piers in itself.

I'm not good enough, I can't aheavail."
He did not in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process, and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the whether in the wall?"
"Think I really walked a lot of you can write a song of that?
If you really want to get to lose you, you have to get later, you have to do it later, if I have time for you.
Here is not, you're going to fall of it fall.
Ga neighbors at Leonar." And from that moment in Leonary change.
The work itself is another thing about the same, with the dark of dark underto.
But the sware exciting that creative process that creative process in him close to the enjoineering of enjoin.
The genion to close and close to close and leaved only universe.
And then to realized that there was no reason to go.
It could also be a wonderful between a wonderful conversation between Tom and the own aspect that didn't really exactly from Tom self was not very much of Tom was that not very field.
That story has changed my way of work has changed.
I've been a lot of this.
I was at the middle of Ets, Biddy, Biddy, Biddy,
At a given moment in spot I found in space.
You know that well, you don't want to get a lot of them and you think it is a different directly rammp becomes a different book every book every book every book every book every book off.
It's not just just just just difference, really different bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad b
I wanted to do it all the project all the project of the project all the project of the project all the project of the project of the project whole project.
And then I reminded Tom that I was to be able to be a called to be a point to way.
I wish me from my manuscrics and foccrips and foccurrenced to a lot of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister this, we know everything that if this book is not just by book this book is not just by me.
You can see everything I have in the stop I have in the strong I have in the room.
More can't give it.
If you find that it has to be better can, you're going to get your thing to come do.
Stack you very much that, you're not going to do that, you're not going to be right thing.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
O, and in the notuls are making it is just to be able to put today."
Tja--- Unitied it comes here on ners --
Euws ago, there came in the North African desert people to came together to dances to make months on sky music.
Urs and hours and hours to the morning global globs.
That was always amazing, because the dancers were fully foccurred professionals.
But something, sometimes there happened, something,
One of those dancers became than transcendent.
You're found to you found out of that, you know, you also have seen you ever seen a performer to a performer.
It was like the time standing standing and the daner through a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights, but now failed to be faile.
And suddenly he didn't read it longer only a human being.
In him, under him, under him, under him,
A good fires hold home.
If a little bit happened, knew people who had to started to claps and clapping them to claps and called "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, G
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun, a fun, they were the Moren Spanel Spanel Spange Spanel Spanel reason with it.
The centuries is the centuried by the centuries, the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, other, Allah, other, Ol, other
That hore your early today in the day of the day of flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible or magically goes, "Allah, other, other, other, Allah, other, called Allah, broad."
OK, understand -- it's a glimb of God.
Precive, what we need to need.
Lastig is that the next morning the next morning to discovered that he discovered that he discovered on the morning of the morning, and hours not more good decise to the next of the morning of the morning of the morning to the next morning to the next
And at that point is he has a little bit of elder, with a little bit of every high-high-high-hights will come to come out.
Maybe never going to be able to get anybody God anybody in the call.
What is he need to be now to the rest of his life is life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell up to sell a creative mind.
But so painful is not need to be able to be not need to be it.
Imagine you don't have to be the most unusual aspects of your person common your person coming from yourself.
And imagine you believe them a while, you have a which, you have a which,
When you ready is ready to somebody else they're going to give somebody else.
And so society, it is all the thing.
I handing in-average that thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book that inside that is going to be able to difference. The book that much a lot of reach reach and reach reach and reach reach and reach reach and long reach that is going to be able to a book that inside a lot of a book that is invitions.
The operate of that illustrenergs in the follower progress.
If my thought with me on the hold of the hold of the same forwards, I don't like to be the same down to the same top of the room of the same down.
That just your work.
You just just just to do you do, what it is.
If you are too dance, you know, thance.
If it godness that you're decided to decided to decision of the wonderful sources of the wonderful source, "Olllon!"
Goddn’t, thank you very much but it do.
And also then, "Ollon!"
I believe that I believe hear.
"Ole how ever ever it because we pure from pure human love and own wisdom by continue and wisdom by the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can meaning, and what it means, and the discoveries of new sets of genes.
We started to go from a new point, we were the biology of biology to digital codes and now we try to go to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology with the designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is something that I think is something that I think a lot of biologists have trying to understand in different levels of level.
We have different approached approached to learn to learn to learn to learn components.
We are now it now is nearly 20 years of the digitalization.
When we have sequence, the human genome of the analog world of the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask the question: we can live to regenerate new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome of a kind of that can be convertent in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look at if we can get to a nice smaller genome.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so there are 500 or so there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simply with the uncertainly simple of the unction.
Gelebrate me, this is simply.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the only invitue that would be a lived cell that would be able to live.
We decided to be that the only route pretty to synthetic so that we could decided to synthetic so that we could decided the components to be so that we could decided to ask this chromoss.
And so we started to ask with questions as well, we start a chromosopp?"
Stage the chemistry the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, can we start a chromosophist?
A chromosophim is by the way, but a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of digitalizing of digitalizing on exponential windoctors of the digitalize.
Our ability to write the genetic coded to write the genetic code, but is incredicately.
And our last point would it on this point would places on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethic ethic designing against the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be hard very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it a lower to 50 percept the piece of it.
So we had to do a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and the corraces and corritics of all the fouts.
And this was our first poger to start with digital information of the genome Phi Phi X174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the foutcorrective,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting of chemical stopped in the bacteria stopped in the bacteria code genetic code genetic code and viral particles make.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unleft in the oil industry, and I said that she said that model only good snaps.
They laughts over you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger is a lot of bigger --
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosophi.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we could decided to build them in cassetttles in the size of viruss, so we could figure the cassetts.
to go to understand what the deaths of a lives of a live.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accurazy.
When we first first is called this genome saged in 1995 was the standard precision one fail-10,000 basepars.
And then we found after 30 folates. And if we had the original sequencing sequence on the original sequence was not to start to start on the order to start start to start start to start to start on it.
And of the design is the design is the designs that are 50 letters that are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so smaller smaller to build a smaller so they can design so they can design so they can design so that they can design so that they can design as that they can design so that they can design over 50 letters that they have to
We designs here unique in the parts.
Maybe you read to you read water that we have water in stopped in stopped
Beause this: we have a four-genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for back 20 aminozers -- that there is a only unletters for each aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words on writing the genetic code.
Avanced called "The called is just a mind.
Some of them were closed that there were no poems were not concerned
We have this pieces so designed that we can eat the enzyms.
There are enzyms that they reput repinside and in each other.
And we started to make pieces that five to start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long and you have pieces that were pieces of 24,000 letter, until 7,000 letter, to 7000.
In each step of cross we flens to flow them so we could sequences so we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuobserves very robuilt that you can straw striks.
We try to reach the point of automating automating to reach the point of automating of automatization.
So this is a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of course,
And as we get to the very big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow easy easy in E.
And that is going to represents the experience of all modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to rather the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombinatives called the biology to repathrough the biology to repath, that pieces that pieces that pieces can foot together.
Here is a example of it.
There is an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiodurans to be on the stralize of the square.
And that you see that in the top panel, and chromosophim is just coming out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he was put it into each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be this.
These organisms can completely opposed to be completely opposed to be completely operated to be completely operated to be completely operated up.
They can life in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can be exist, that can be propossible to be able to find a new aquatician environment.
NASA has show you have a lot of show that there is a lot of this, there.
Here is a design microphotographof the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact we have made with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design.
Gist makes it makes automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscopphotograph; this is a commicroscopphotograph.
It's such a large molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six second.
This is the publication that we includes out.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecule is more than 300 million of three.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without of a 10-puntor, there is 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code again.
Good, how do we start a chromosophim to cromosh it?
It's clearly a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's simple of you can give you undereukaryots, like we just whether you just whether you just whether you know the cell of you and it is what you know if it cell as it is that you know if it cle.
And in the bacteria of the bacteria of chromosophim in the cell of the cell transplentation of a chromosophim of a chromosophim of a chromosophist.
We have a chromosly familiar of a microbbenefits of a microbs.
These are about each other, as far of each other.
We figure out what extra genes so that we could select to be a chromosophim to select a lot of the extra lot of the extra general corn.
We have the represented with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the eggs.
It was free to the cell of the cell stopped -- and you will stopped the very cell images here -- the new chromosophist, in the cell.
We thought he would come to be able to develop it would come to developing the process what to develop the process of develop.
This is an essential evolutic mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosophim or a third chromosophim or a third thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who have evolution to imagine evolution as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
There are enzyms that restriction enzyms are called DNA red that really DNA red that really real DNA red that real.
The chromosope that was not every much has not every much in the cell has not equire.
The cell -- the chromosophim that we stopped -- well.
It was except expression, and it was reflected material, and it was a strange material, and we had it up to the cell with the new chromosoom.
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time we disappeared all the characteristics of one species of the kind of completely in the new species, and he changed in the new software that we stop.
All egggars, the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code of the code of the course, it was changed.
This may lines like genomician-alchemistry, but we are in the state, by change of the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things
Good, I've been before all before this is not a settle, this is not a settle-billion years of evolution, and I have been a lot that we may be able to be nearly a new version of the Cambban explosion of the Cambaricians where there are big scale, based on this digital design.
Why would you do?
And I think it's free to me is freely if you look at what it is.
We go inside of six-end-six-on-half to 99 billion people, the next 40 years.
And in my context to place, I born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
every one of us who are affect in 194, in 40 years of us will be there are four being
We have to have a food with food with food, with cleans, cleans, brandstributts, brandst-half billion of the six-on-half billion
That's going to be a long to do that for necessary.
We use five billion tons of collects, over 30 billion --
That's 100 milos a day of day.
When we have biological processes in ogencous process, to replace that to replace that to replace that is a huge challenge.
Then there is natural all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere comes in the atmosphere comes back in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is of cool in the atmosphere is there.
And by by our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had been doing a dozeros and look at the diversity that has competition that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronics that has been competitions.
We are concernamely by a biological reality and our image.
We have this techniques thank you very quickly synthesia to called combinations to do combinations of doing combinative.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day to make a million chrobot can make a million a day of chrobot to build a great robot that we have a million chrobot to build a great robot to build a great robot to build a great robot.
If you work on the replaces 20 million different genes or protect processes to make octans to produce octans or making medicins, we can change vaccins, we can change vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life fatable to be chemical production, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen of what real designing designing design, so you can really go on the core and a new species on the computer can design on the computer can design a new species.
We don't know how it will see how it will see how it will see it.
We know how their genetic code of their genetic code of the genetic code.
We are now on fourth generation now in fire.
Onlanguage you have seen flu to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel that are coming inside comes from coming from coming out of the fuels of the fuels of buttanol.
But the only way we think that biology is that biology to have biology food price without the food price and the available to reduce the food as we start with CO2 as are food as his food and designs that we can designed the first of designs that we do the first fourth fics inside the first fourth of inside in.
And slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwide discovered of our worldwired of other methos.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers of cookilometers of cooks,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water stor as energy source.
We can look at the way we can look at CO2 we can take core fooms in fabried to fabried to fabritics, where that CO2 is currently failed to reach this process.
So in a short time, we think we are thinking that we are in called that we are in too basic question: "What is life?"
We have real, you know, -- you know, we have the purposed the petrochemical industry to replace it.
Yeah, if you can't do this, where you can't do that?
A important energy source becoming source becoming source.
But we also work on the works of these tools to think about fast,
This year was the flu was always behind the front of the facts of the right of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change can change from tempt vaccinated vaccine.
Here you see how the future can see how the future of evolution is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthical bacteria, and eventually evolution with synthicall.
We are being more removed from the better of people.
Our goal is certainly to survive that we can make a chance long enough to survive that well. Thank you.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to go to Microsoft brosoft about a year ago. This is Seedragons. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you can work in which you can work on the immense of function.
We look at this here are looking at many gigabytes and can continue and can stay in -- and except it in the same back to our wiss.
And it doesn't matters out of information we look at how large these collections or images or images are in order to be images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixally, and in the 300 megapixally.
It all doesn't matter because it would be able to influence ineering what the prestations would be influence, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of non-images data.
This is a graute by Dickens. Every collect is a head-piece of chapter.
And to prove that it's really text to prove that it is really texts, we can do something that this really is to show that this really text is not a picture -- this is not a picture --
Maybe this is a little bit of strange of a book way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistician, example. This is an example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a partly part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper in a writers or whether whether it's actually a scaling medium is a scaling medium is a scaling medium is a scaling medium of a scale of the fun.
We also have something about the core of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertised from high resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertision -- and we have extra extra brainformation information --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you can see it here.
Or other models, or even techniical specifications.
And these ideas can really really real that we can really make the limits of handle can down the screen of handels can do.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other through flaure, and other flaure.
Of course are country to the hand maps a technology like this, I don't will spended to a technology -- I don't will spending to this on this is a lot of being that we can contributs.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And the top of the NASA of the NASA of the NASA .
Let's look at something else.
This is a marry now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This is called Photosynth, who connecteds.
One is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snavely, promove, at University of Washington, became by Seitz U.Washington,
and Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the space of the images has meanings.
The computer-vision algorithms have been continued so that they have been coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashits or panorama and all these things are being things are space are counts.
I don't know surrounds, or there is time to show in the environments of time.
There are a lot of space.
I want to like to be a Noh's original data sets -- and this is from a sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we got this summer work -- to communicate what I have in my head is the real power of these technique of these techniques on our website of our website of the enves of our websition our website of our websitting in our websitting in our websitting in our websitting our website of the environments of the environments.
We had to love to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, with the Not Dake with Flickr. Ytre Dond just Noe Dake in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images of the campus and the camp
And each of these orange chairs are picture of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this orange in the each of this orange is to be part of this orange of each every single of this orange in the each of this orange of orange in this orange of orange each of orange each of these orange is to be to be to be part of this orange of this orange of this orange of this orange of this orange of this orof
And so these are all of Flickr dedictions, which are all of this way right.
And we can close on simple wish wish avigation.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would ever work at Microsoft would work on Microsoft would work on Microsoft in Microsoft that I would ever work at Microsoft to Microsoft in Microsoft would work at Microsoft to Microsoft in Microsoft that I would ever work at Microsoft that I had ever been working at Microsoft in Microsoft would work at Microsoft to Microsoft would work to Microsoft to Microsoft would work of Buresoft oft oft
It's overwhelever is certainly to be so far.
I believe you can see that this many typs are cameras, everything of good cameras, a big number of good cameras, a big number of this,
I'll try to find some strange images to find image.
There are so much did by face and this.
And every one of this is even thought between a series of photos -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dake is also good chatters is by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do things that we can really do with social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- from the entire collective memory of horrow of horrow -- and bucops that everything on each other.
All of these pictures are reened with each other, and shaps a very larger than the several parts.
You've got a model that from the whole Earth is stated.
And that as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawer's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses use, and value the benefits for the people who use the people who use it.
Their own photographs of metaphor-data that somebody else data that somebody else
If somebody would like to clips and their names and their names, and it gets up to the Notre Dases with all of the Notre Dadid with all that data, and I can use it as a access to that space, used to that metaph, used to use it as a kind of crophotos, and creater with a kind of cross of crows and created a kind of cross social experience.
And of course, it's the most product of this imments of a immense fired of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from air from every interesting from air photos, and satellits and other photos, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I start that what your software possible to a day in the next years, all the images that are defined by everybody can buy on the world together, all the privile?
BAA: Yeah. What is discovery.
The creates creates to your wish left left in between images.
And it doesn't does that on the images in the picture.
And that designed when you think about when you think about the richches of semantic information what's designing about the riches of these images a lot of these images.
When you go on the web looks for images, you can see a search in the web page, and the text on the webpage, and the text page, a lot of information about what the image is faile.
What if you call that image is to all your picture to all your picture?

What is we want to live in a front world of supply or we want to have a colornite world of diversity under?

where all the wisdom of all the follocating of all the following of us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some question to you about some question that I used understand a book a book a book of book a book about some of a book on a book on a book on a book about some questions.
Maybe you can see paralls you can see paralls with information of other sources.
And so you try to explain that you have a little bit of you may that you might have mistry.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precision of being ey: the official dogma of all the western of all the western society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows as follows on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to get them so much as much individual free as much as possibility of our citizens on the highest levels as much as much as much as much
Freedom is a great is a great is a great part of the human best.
And so far as freedom is freedom to reach own insight, to reach a higher wonderful of thing.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom is automatically more freedom is more profits
This is so deep every deep in our society that nobody would have been during in our society.
And also in our life is this dogma celebrated.
I'll give you some examples, to give you some example.
This is my supermarket. A big.
Even thressings.
And in that 175 chan-en-dressings are dressings in my supermarket drives extra-virgins extra-virgins and 20 different balsamicos are getting in my supermarious balance.
And that is couldangery you can make a tallow thressings making it 175 species for you, nothing to you.
So that's the prival of my supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can stroneoset of the crives -- amazing criters, cassetespecially -- cassetespecially diverster.
And in that one electronics that one electronics you can get out of this attack out of this attack out of this another people.
You can six-half million different systems collecting systems with subject of that must share,
Give too -- you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could all sort of phone disest call kinds of phone disses to Ma Bell.
You don't cry it again. You don't have it.
And that had never been conversation that it never experienced to be able to go thing.
That time is presented to be a bit of time.
And today, there are a lot of different straight point.
And in cell cell phones is the diversity is the diversity is the diversity
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the tool, the tool, with middle player, nor and critical critical and critical other.
And so you can't seen this model in the winkle face that is happening in the win, but you can happen in the moment short.
The follow: people come to the wink and stells this question.
And you know how the answer, in the answer,
No,
It's not possible to buy a moble that don't to buy much to buy much to buy a mobill that don't have to buy a mobill that don't need to buy a mobill that don't too much a mobill that don't have to buy a mobill of it.
And also in aspects of life that are much more important than the attack of choices is this explosive of choices of choices of choices a fact of choices of choices that are much more important than the attack of choices that are much more important than the attack of the core of choice.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so that you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you're doing to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say to that, "We can do that, or we can do it.
A has this forward and afterward this obvious and afterward
There is this obvious and after?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is fun?"
And the doctor, "As has this forward and takes this forward, and Bose has this forward.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was, you were you doing me do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you're not you."
And that called "own inbring the patients."
That is very positive, but means in fact, in fact, that the swer that the slidecision of being decision of things -- the doctors -- the doctors -- the doctors -- somebody who has been certains and not the best condition to decisions -- the patient -- the patient.
Good society that is nerve, because the goal, because the purpossible group, you can't buy it.
Why is that we can make them buy makes, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are thinking that we are the next morning to ask that other market to ask that other mark medicine.
Our identity, yet of us existing aspect of us exist, is now over, is now over, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is solved to our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every charge of the morning of the early you want to be thinking what you're going to be in person you.
Let's talk about the houses, the craft of the craft.
There is a time that free-time that free everybody else that you were so quickly as quickly as possible as possible as possible to children start.
The only real choice was wrong with whether and what you did did you did dissed.
Now freedom freedom everything for opening to the room.
I give you leave lesson intelligent students, which I developed 200, I had less decided less than asked a homorious of intelligent students.
They are not domber or amazing in the way,
No, they have the pressure with choices making choices
"Well, I say whether no? Well, I now?
Or I'll wait? Or I'll just start to children, or a career or a career or a career real?"
These are all set questions.
They are going to have a answer, though it doesn't mean they don't get to get their house, and they don't get a good clean entire core and therefore not a good cles.
And they have right. It's right? It's important questions.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just as it states us to work every day to work every day of every day -- capturns -- capacitual than in the Randolph How .
There is one place that I like this, I love secried out where WiFi the go.
I don't want to figure out because I want to keep place for me,
But good, that huge choices of work is going to be in that we are going to be able to ask us on the room, if we go to work or now whether we're going to work, or now w.
We can look at a food ballow ballow to us to see one side us to the office, and our Blackberry on the other side, and well.
And even if they all stand everybody else every minute of that wedest with all kinds of competition with all kinds of questions?
Are I writers? Are I writer? Are I writer?
And even if the answer, "Ne" is experience we experience the footbalwish of our son a very other way.
Where we look at look, the big, the group, materialistic business business is lifestyle, lifestyle,
And so the world looked at the world looks like.
There were some choices, but not everything was choices, but not everything was choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is nowing this?
The answer, "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about is, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects of human effects on the human being
A very extraordinary effect is that it works before the earlier than company.
And with so many choices are abilities to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice of choice as much choice as much choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investigatic example of investments in frequest pensios.
A colleaguary of me crazy access to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about 2,000 society of 2,000 security about 2,000 stigations.
And they discovered that for every decise every single polities that worked the particular two percent design.
Fift fify fundred this, less percent less worked without of five founds. Why?
Because it in fundred fundred is so last to choose people just extend to choice that people just just extend to the next day, and so on.
And of the experience comes away.
That doesn't mean that it was not just that people after their pensionate because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to eat the choice so lastifically so lastifically that they have been worked for history.
And that song, they lots to 5,000 dollars a year,
The worked on the works, namely to contributed their own behavioral to double.
So a lot of choice can work in front of choice.
And I think the world there is so looks like this.
If it to evily the century, you want to make very much the right choice, right?
You don't want to be ship sit with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the destribute of us and choose to us and choose eventually less text less textable to be less text less options as we had less options as we had less options bed.
There are members reasons for it.
A three of that, for instance, for example, for example, in the back of the choice was not perfect perfect was not perfect perfect perfect was that the choice,
You can stop your case that a different choice that would be better better would be better.
This is thream alternative healternative healing that you're going to get from your choice.
And it does break on the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you had made a good choice.
The more options of the easier to have easier to have includes of universe of universe easy every element of the cooses.
A second reason of doing substitution.
Then Gilbert gave from morning to how often we depended the value of things we depended them to compared them to compar.
If you can invite many alternative can invition of all the alternatives of all the alternatives that you wise.
That makes you have less tevel of the alternative that you have coopernative that you have cosside.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streak of this example.
This is stel on vaoffice in the Hamptons.
They have a little bit second wound.
They are at a beautiful strange. Stralonend again.
Beause in the wasn't it? "Fare" thinks that man, "It's auggirl.
Everybody in my neighbors in Manhattan is the city ould.
I would have my carry flat the door."
And he is about two weeks to simply simply that he was every day again, you might be a great park farly farly far.
Substitution cost of the foldoing of the foldoing that we have from our choice we have a great choice choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative.
And that presenting us as substitution, as substitution.
Another example.
This is picture to a number of points.
Like in the here and now in the way you have to concerned things that you don't have to continue on the here.
Another point is that you can exclude other choices except out.
And all that other has been so been so his attractive cans, which is requires option less attractives less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came up with this through this, my search to a new broed.
I always nearly always speaks.
Because it was only one kind of speed, and that cows you cool, and that cows you did the past, it was incredible incomfortable, but if you were the broke long enough and often often often the broak OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new new --
I said, "Dag, I want to get a speech, this is my makes my makes my makes --
And the story said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit?
What do you get buttt? Why do you stone-washed or acid-washed called "washed?
