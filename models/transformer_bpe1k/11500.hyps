And I think that the two dia's two dia's shows to show that the police cap, who had the last three million years, which was about the size of the vastany of the U.S, with 40 percent of the United States of the U.S.
But this is the reason of this particular problem because it doesn't the diculating of the ice of ice issue.
The ice of the North is in a certain is certain the cape of our global system.
It looks in the winter and crymessarier.
The next dia that I shows is a version of what the last 25 years is happened in 25 years.
The permanenge is individual, in rood.
As you see, it looks at dark it from dark to dark out of darks.
That's the years, it's the year ast,
And it was in the sumer in the sumer.
And the same permanence of ice, or five years, or parently as blood is almost like blood is like blood in this body.
In 25 years is the way of this is going to be gatts.
And that's a problem because the wrors around the North Issea of the North Issea very great of course and there's a very great amount of cool invented that is free in methane, when it designs is invity.
And that was increating the total hunt in the atmosphere, that would be how to double that could be expensive to the case of the total concerness.
In some underput in Alaska borrels in Alaska borrely of the water.

Which is OK. The question is whether we will be be going to be that are going to be
A reason is that this enormous "warms Groenls from the north,
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than ever larger than ever larger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlusually directly in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea country because it is the faile, it's the place where it is the place where it is the place where it is the sea place where it is the place come.
These stromations are flight to be flight
And on the planet, on the planet, on the South pool, the most ice is the most ice of the planet.
Africans are scientists that the whole continent now is that the entire continent now is a negative report of the balance of the continue continent of the entire continent that the whole continue continent of the encount.
More specific is the ice of the South of the South pool very quickly quickly on the same of the same botts.
The whole continent is for six meters sea bit for six meter, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the only two after the biggest ice massa, there are now new three ago, who were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the half of his dances of the smell time.
In the Andes, is this gler the bron of dress the bron of threedincludes for this city.
There are more strowing thing.
But when they disappears it also does it dress the dress water.
In California was there was a fure of 40 percent in snow.
It's really in the water reseries in the water reseries of water reseries of water reseries of waterres.
And as you could read it, his predictions are the predictions of it.
This world produced dreamed to a dramatic styction of burned brands.
And the number of natural and the world is called the world with a incredible and never seen a speeed.
And in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely understanding.
If you look at it from a historic context than you see what happening.
In the last five years of the last year we have 70 million CO2 hours --
Now 25 miles in our oceans, Kevery day in our ocean, Kean area of Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every single draws of the Indian except of the ocean, there is a drawsted in the ocean.
The only great warming of the Earth, navailimagine, which is that for 20 percent of the phossil fuels of fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the most problem,
The United States is one of the two largest extinclude with China.
And there was a pretty more still centrals.
But we see a came up with it.
These are the cities of the bold centrales that was the bold in the last years, and where there were alternatives and where large alternatives were prettty in the last of the based in the last of the benefits of the bits that was presents.
There's a political stripped to the gang in our country.
The cities of cities and oil industrial gave year, 250 million dollars to promots, which is a city-cool promots, which is a generate.
And that imagine to think about something about this.
Rond the guess was in Tennesse, in Tennesse, about four billion liter billion literally cools
You probably have the news in the new corn.
This is the one after one after one after one after the biggest of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adverties of the cities, the Kerst was the Kerst was death.
Video: "We've been found the cities, a lot of cool is a blice, oppo.
He is the confluences in America, and he she's sormous of our economy grow.
Frosted the cities of the day is with the day.
He's mean, and certain and works, and called their bate."
Here's a big part of the citied in West Virginia of the cities.
The biggest worker of the land is the great based of Massey Coal.
Video: "Let Blanck -- "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they know about where they don't know where they know about where they know about they're talking about about that."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our us.
That's the reason why the most important thing to be a gigantic to reclass to reclass to reclass and the confious and the truth of the truth of the truth that is about the truth of the truth of value that is the truth of the truth is why the reason of the light of
Feit is, is not sal.
We think it's a son that it is -- and it's still led to be a bit of course.
So, you don't know about climate change.
Let me sure that but on us over.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about heard.
So let's look at this hypermodern modern modern modern cool.
Fantastic! The machines are best what law.
But that's the sound of sound sound cool technology.
And thanks the fact that the fact that the fact of cities, one of the most important thing that is change the Earth, the Earth is change the earth of the Earth, the same of technology that you can see here.
Look around the women, this is the scale of the day.
Al Gore: Einverage pass the positive alternative at the economic challenges and that are area of national security of national security of national security of national security and that are area of national security challenges and that are area of national challenge.
Video: Stem: America crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The red was in all these things that are basically our dependence, our dependence, like fiuile and police instance.
But now there's a durful, new solution to get this.
And the America of 100 percent of electricity in 10 years.
A plan America to get operate operating that is a plan that our safe and the opwarming of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
Einally a solution that are enough to solution to solve our problems to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the lat.
Video: Stem: Stem: It's about America to give America
One of the fastest ways to make a end of the same of our planet, view, fields that are brandstoffs that are all of our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then 2: New we investmental jobs to create good jobs
Stem: Repower America. Tike realistic to be realistic
Al Gore: There's a old African speaks, "If you want to be a quickly, "If you want to be all of it.
If you want to go to do, you know, ga samen."
We have to go and far ast.
Thank you very much.
And I was a year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I came back with a hole of how that works.
So here. I am not have been there: the LHC is the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment in the miment of experiment in the ometers in understands in the ometer.
It has to be the granding of the circumstances that were less than a billion billion to be until 100 million times to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition, dus!
This is the machine,
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors that I work. It was the ATLAS. It was the ATLAS.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And in 10 september form we say, we put the machine.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That was a party for a party in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the LHC and with the LHC and with opposed with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the detector of the first particle of the first particle.
With other words, when we saw that picture that the machine, we went that the machine, which is a huge over-ormous win.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest of the biggest and saw someone to Google and saw the Internet page.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what had to do with these gold before.
And that were drawing 13 thousand amps when the machine, the machine.
The ingengineers under you will say, "No are to small draw."
They can do that because they can do that they can be superperature on wholed to the lage temperaturs.
So at 271 grads, then the same space between the space between the girls, that can do read before that before die.
In one of the biness of the necessary of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And that was the wirely warming something warmer, and there was a electrical weather electrical against 13 thousand ample of thousand ample of thousand ample of electrical warms of the became thousand ample of it was became thousand ample of electrically ans that was there was a thousand ployed thing.
This was the result.
This is another indrugs when you realized that that magnets more than 20 ton that magnets more than 20 percent, and they were about 30 centimeter in the picture.
We probably about 50 magnets.
We had to have them out of it.
We all have particularly particular.
Now, they're back on away.
Eind might be the LHC weather intact.
We will expect him and we expect it in you, and we expect in you, so we can go to the explains of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, have been increating increating the debate of science, the value of science. It's easy research of science.
I think it's so difficult that it's so difficult that we go to be able than the value of things like the LHC.
And I learned the last words on the English science, I was defected to the devalue of the valuable of the valuable of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Farday, this is so that we did to the presently says, "Nthing is so much of the increating of the increating of the science, that we have been not have been not experimental to be not definitioned that we have to be able to be not to be design that we discovered that we discover, and that we discovered to be able to be able to do through the company design that we discovered that is not have been not have been leare, and they have been learribefore that they discovered to be able to be able to be experive experive experive experive experive ex
Thank you.
And I would want to start with you with you to get back to your children to your children with blockids with blocks.
And then you discovered how you had to understand how you had to go to and awing them and walked to solve with the depended with the depended with the engineers of space relationships.
And Rutell you is strongs because with the world to understand that we can understand us.
If a information of information inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samp with my advisual Pattion and my medicure -- what I started to ask me -- what we started to ask me -- what we would use -- what we would use -- what we used a computer instance, in place of that we'd be a computer information with a lot of that weedge inforce we can unders on a funderstand what we can understand what we can understand that meant,
And can and orders like we want to let this?
This question this question that we decided to look at a answer of Siftable.
Cort samental is a Sifty interactive computer in the size of a cookood.
They can be able to put up with the hand they can be felectly fellow and they can free a screen and they can free a screen and wirely contact.
The nuclear is the physical handled to understand that can be able to understand by understand by understand by understand through it to understand
Bovendis are Siftables a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
There's a more physical different of the physical differences are of their movement, and even of their movement, and even of the way we have been different new and even of propers and have different new and interactions of interactions and discovery.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftis insted to tell a video to tell a video that played play and others and others and others and others played on the backwards.
These interactive portraits are existed to be each other.
Indis are place, they will get to each other, they will be interesting.
If they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be some sense of the same thing and what are become to be become thing.
And then they feels they feel and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting of interesting that is the interesting of these interaction, the using of the interaction, as it was a small of a small of a small of a small of a small of a food.
In this pictures three Siftable, and I can use them to make them to make them to go into a less of good, where they have ments, where they get increated to go and where they have ment.
If we have reason, we have some back.
There's some of cape cape for the education, prepared to the education, mathematics with language, and logics that we want to give people to give things that is to proaching people to see things that is understand the result unch of the education.
And here I mean, this is the development of a Fibonacci acci resulty program of a simple program --
And here we show you that a spelt between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter in every Siftable, and case that are control, and cased in a words, and cased in a words.
After about 30 seconds, it is really rescue, and different ent a new series of inside of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am and there's a video of it.
They were actually actually actually actually used to be there.
And one of the most interesting things of these things of these application is that people almost not need instruction.
All you know, "Moh words, and they know what they know is to do is what they have to do thing.
There's some other people on the test.
That's our younest basically tester, regular.
And it seems to be the Siftable.
For him was just to be this blocks.
And here is a interactive painting shown of the interactive.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learning of language.
This is Felix that demonstreate.
He can bring new karaks, by the scene of the scene with that corned with that character of the table.
Here's soon, he sun.
Video: The son comes up.
David Merrill: No he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
God though! Yeah!
And though the sup, and the name, and the name electable, he can put the carea --
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a open with a open with a open in a open of it.
and he decision how it decided to decided
Video: The cates away away.
DM: The last example I will show that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed to developed a sound product that every Siftables and based a sound and drum.
And one has four different variations, where you can get to you can get to do that.
These happiness, in leage Siftable, so you can be injected to pattern it pattern it can pal.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a lege Sift-controlled effects and fill effects and filter.
They are become to a sound and put by can.
And thought the algemental effects like tempo and compum that are pated on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We've start with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftable, to a extra lead.
Now, I place the based of the based
Video: Do I feel what I feel a bit of work
Video: And I call the filter of the drums, so I can do it effect the effect can influence.
Video: M: I can cell it very square of the cans of the office of the tempo blocke.
Video: Do you cope the filter for what I was the filter for what more expression.
Video: M: I can rereported it pattern the play.
So I don't have anything to plan, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, it very longer and shorter longer and corter longer and crack and corter longer and I can make it very longer and I can make it very longer and I can't me.
With the dimmmmessing of the following Siftly.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of new people, from new people, are coming to the way that are better interfaces that are better to the way our brains and bodies are working and bodies and work and work and work and work and work and work and work on the way to work and bodies that are better interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfac
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designed in this designing with some of the developing of the same way that we are in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is the bad of the increating is a very new generation to the interact with digital media, that the information with digital media, which is the information to our world wanted to go to our world wanted to let it.
Thank you very much.
And I look at it to get with you all and talk to you all all and talk to you to get with you all and you get to to you all with you all and you get to you with you all and I look at it with you all and I look at it to get with you all and I look at it to get to to you all and I look at it with you all and you look at it with you all and get to get out of you all and you look at out of you to get to get with you all
I'm write out.
Buk is my work, but also much more than that.
My life long life I am not have to change and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there's unless of something that was happened in my life and career and career that I had to see my work with my work with my work with my work and career to see my work and cared.
And it started with a book that I wrote unled to be understanding on the work of "Ets, Biddle, Bible in my first work to my first work about my first work and international design the work work about and international deal.
The sequences of people have to be always to be always to be a bit of course.
We've done where --
People come to me and questions and questions that you can't get this successaren?
And you don't think you have to be able to be whose to be able to be a book more a book more a book more a book where people will be able to warm where people will be able to warm where people will be los?
And you can't get there?"
Ery good stells you know it.
Now, that would be very much that I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, I was when I was a tienerous -- I was told that I wanted to be a teent.
People said, "Ben you don't have to be able to be success?
And you don't get to be able to represented through to resese?
And you don't get to be that you live to this work without that there's ever that there's ever dreams and that you have been doing to the puin your broken on the puin your bitters of your bitters of falen?"
Everything in that streking.
And in the short comes my answer on that questions questions that questions, "Yeah.
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are called
Always alway.
But I also much other things that are very different things that all you don't know know that all thing.
For very much for very much example, and other engineering things.
But what is write I write myself the last time that angling anger few feet.
Is it rational rational rational rational
Is it logical that someone gives to be awing to work for work to their opinion Earth are in the are?
What's so so so that we are so far to creative processes, we make the effects of the effects of the minds, something that is not happens to happens to happens to happens to happens to happens to happens to happens to happens to happens to be the speak of the minds.
And then I call my father. He was swish, and I can't remember that there was a bit of the 40 years, that he was not a bang for there.
And so from "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
Now, so not work about it.
And in fact, for a single engineers have not the centuries have been not the reputation to be reputation for piece for piece for piece of manic makes for piece of manic makes have been to be a bit of ewn.
Sup, that have been about that kind of reputation.
Not only other creative people have been reputation to have been reputation human being instable.
Look at the grimble dodental dodental creative mind the most magnifical creative mind of the 20th century.
And many died young, you know, often by own own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own young,
And even the same thing that don't have a moorn place to be under their gave gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a self.
In the last interview for his dread said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailers."
That's what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of looking at the kind of looking at that we don't look at it.
We all have been heard and have heard and have it with so-accepted and have accepted it with solid and have accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity creativity is invented with lish is with lish and that a artist-ineventually ineventually to expensive to expensive the same though.
And so I want to question here today question: can you be with that idea of life --
Do you know, OK?
Now, I think about it is good I think about it all of it didn't not be pretty pretty though.
I think it's know.
And also another dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century.
We can creative mind a lot of better inclue to life.
And I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, without to that dark to that dark up to that dark up to that dark to that dark for me.
Something that I think my career where my career in my career now is now.
And you know, I'm still young, I'm still young,
I can work I can work four decades are doing four decades
And they probably will be all that I have to have another published by the outside world as it work on that extraordinary successful is just succcessful
We are with friends with friends each other, so I can probably light my greatest successary of behind my greatest successary of behind me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it is the eye of your eye to eight necessary to the drive edge in the drive of the drive.
So I don't want to do it.
And I love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love love to love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work of love with the work of love with the work of love with the work where I love with the work where I love of love with it.
The question is: "Hoe?"
Now, after long after long to the conclusion that I can just go by with writing a psychological scribed in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process.
I have to create a safe a safe of descrips between myself, and my government and my concerned anger for the reactions of my future.
And I have the last year in ways to do that.
And I'm in the history and have done in the history and have found in other history to see or others a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creations of creations that creations of creations of creations that creations of creations of creations of creations of creations that may be
My search has been brained to the old Gred and Romein.
Leop, because it's a long and increated story.
In the time of the old Gred and Romeins and Romeins not that creativity was not creativity was from itself.
And I believed that creativity creativity was a good place of a real, inknowledge to the ment, and unknowledge and unknow.
The Greeks that call these necessary of creativity "demonen."
And also Socrates believed that he had a demoon who had a demoon that was influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And in the called it called a genidentify creative creative to a genius.
The grape is that the Romeins with a genion a genion without a pientter person indust.
In their polluding was a genial magined a kind of magined in the mure of the ateller of the ateller of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the homeal.
If the work of the work was working for the work of the work of the work of evention.
And he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise that I had the first talk about the psychological protection of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The artist, in protection in protection to protection for example,
If you work down there, you didn't have all the early there.
Everybody knew that you had a unvisible genion you had heal.
You know, you work on the work of you, then you didn't just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty input a very understand.
Lige time is that became how in the Wests creativity was the Wests are creativity to the Wests are creativity in the Wests are creativity in the Wests creativity of the Wests creativity was the Wests creativity in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything change.
There's a very new idea: the individual people, the individual people, and the middle of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterions.
No space for mystical recents, atator, from the godnases of the global world.
That was the beginning of the rational home of the rational homething of the rational homething of the rational homeain of the rational hometer.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of individual.
And for the first in history of the history was said that they were said that they were not a genion gene and they were not have a genion that they had a genion that they had a genion that they had a genion the history.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a great failed
To one person one person, one person is one individual individual is that he safe is the essentially the bron of the ewonderful mysterious mystery of what good is that is something that is to much a lot of answer sychedge for a fragy human psych.
Anyone question in clicks.
Egos are blaws to gigantial proportunity and there's increating expected to prestations of prestations of prestations and expected to prestations and
And I think this drugs that this drugs are a lot of artists has made a lot of artists made a lot of artists that has made a lot of artists a lot of artists that this druck of artists that this druck the last 500 years.
If that is, and I think is the question, "What do do do do this?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship between the relationship between mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years rational home of home in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of play.
And probably in the audience of people who have been in the audience of the developed scientific designs of the feed-basically feedits of artists that inspire of artists inspire of artists inate inspirating high high high high of the audience.
It doesn't seems that I will all you get all of you get in there.
And I asked it to me it me it.
Why not?
Why would we didn't have thought that thought to be though?
It is just so much as much as all the other explanations of the total makes that decided to be able to be able to be able to creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something that has been trying to create all the number of the same thing -- you know, that the creative process -- you know, the creative process of always --
That sometimes it almost paranormal purpoint.
I have unled the great American dicher Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone of Ruth Stone of American discovery.
And she is directly in the next.
She told me about her justed on the plates of Virginia.
Soms, if they were on the work was working on the work was felt she was a close she was coming a close of country.
It was, so said, "Well, if there was a big golf air fair.
And so, the close golf than the country to her her it.
She felt that the ground under her foot and went and went and went and went to her on that her on that her life.
And they went to home, backward by the closed and they had to see so quickly and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper than the closed and paper than the closed to home and paper than the closed and paper than the closed to hind hind hind hind of backin the closed and then they had
When it was close by her her her was her her to write her only to write it on the same to write it.
Sometimes it was not fast.
Then ring and ring soing and ring the house.
And in the close moments of school closed by her -- in her words on the fired -- in her words -- in her words -- to another dich.
And then there were along one, I think that this is beautifull part of the story -- they almost of the story -- they almost mistake.
And then she was in home in search and paper and paper and schools it through her through her through her and paper to her her and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and primarkay, and then it was her in home.
And Juist on that moment she had a potoment than a potal
And with her other hand, so told me she was closed the closed of the air.
They painted the close of his start, and then then the weather, while she writy.
In that came out of that came out of close that in sare, but then in a clot of paper in the case of paper --
When I heard that high-day -- what I thought to be my creative process of creative process of the creative process of the creative process of course,
That's how my creative process of clos! I'm not medium! I'm not medium! I'm not medium! I'm not medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not medium! I'm not medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not working fun.
I'm a mouse mush, who was the same time, which is the same time, and same up with blood and with blood and trans and trans around and trans around and trans a state.
But even in that day, I have been equired to be a experience of experience.
You know, you will also know it also feel that are creative ideas that are creative ideas that you can see increate in your opbron that you can can be impossible.
What is that than res?
How can we use it without that without we can be able to be become though?
At us a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think I can think I can think of this is musicians to be the Waits.
A few years ago, I was a couple for a time.
We had the this.
And in fact, in fact, a great part of his life life the showed of the wonderful artived of all the power artists that are produces from all the power to get to the unbeing creative impact to him in him that are creative impact in him increative impacts.
With the 190s was what the back of the back.
And in a day reason he was in Los Angly, and changed the speak process and changed the process of the percent force of the fast.
And as he was so repretty he was a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that is inspiration that we've done ungrated to understand there.
It was a beautifull owho wanted to be the fasth.
But it didn't wout.
He had no paper too, no pies, no taperecorder at the tape of it.
The great example, the example, is the walked the melody of him -- "I remembers it to be the eventually being me the eventor.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He not walked in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry heard not see that I behind the hind I behind the stuff of the same do?"
"Do you really think I can receiv?
If you really want to get this loth, you have to be later once as I was just a little bit of time for you.
That's not just somebody else did somebody else.

Tja--- Uited the invite of the course.
Earths ago, there was in the North African wish African woost, to dance in the North African woul.
And they were going to be backward to the ochtendges and hind to the morning.
That was always great, because the dances were completely professionals.
But some happened in a very real thing happened though.
One of that dances became than transcening.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you know, you also have been in a performer.
It was like the time still still and the dance, and the dance.
He didn't did anything than the thousands of night, but now field,
And the suddenly he didn't longer longer only a ment.
In him, under him, bottom, hem, bottle.
A good fired to him through him.
If so did something happened to be what was was Dan started to class and in class and in class and in the class and in Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
Tromens, a leucky fact, Toen the Moren South South Spange Spanside Spange of the south with with with with with with with with with with with it.
The really, is real by the centuries of the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, one."
That high-day still still stimages and flamengodance.
If a artist, in Spance or magically does or magically does it comes men: "Allah, one, Allah, Allah, one, wonderful Allah,
And, understand sea: a glimp of God.
And we have what we need need to have it.
Lastig is that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to dinclue 11 hours not a good laws not a good lains more than good lads.
And in that moment is he went to be a little bit of parently with couldn't have a little bit more to be high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high.
Maybe there's going to be more anyone God attend attend at thane.
What do he now to the rest of his lifes?
That's hard.
That's really difficult to create a creative mind.
But so the pinside it doesn't have to be able to be it
Imagine not that you have to be increated the most increating increating your person from your person from your person from your person from your person --
And imagine you believe that you have a time to let them have a time, or not a bit of a didn't have a whificate to specificate to specificate of a didn't have a time.
When you get there.
That's what you protect everything.
I hands that are thought to be thought to be though.
The last months I have to be a book that book that book is going to be a lot of where much a lot of that is a lot of reach to read is except to be a lot of reikhalf to be a book.
The opens of that illuster progress.
If my thought with me to the hall, I love me to the same thing that I was the same thing that you can't bank.
There's just your work.
And just just just you do this, what it is also there.
If it is to dance, just thansws thansw.
If it good genion that you're decision to decision your work on one of the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by long"
Thane not, thane than than than than than than than than right.
And also than: "Ol!
And I believe that harted.
"Ole one." And because we have from pure human loved and own increating by the way,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had it already have been about a couple of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can means of genes.
We started to start from a new point, we were the digital biology to the digital code of that digital code to a new fase code to a new fase in biology and synthetics and synthetics of life.
So we always trying to state the great questions.
"What is something that I think about what I think I think that much biologists have trying to understand on different levels on different level.
We have a different benefits tried to learned to less to minimal components.
We are almost 20 years, we are almost 20 years on the digitalization.
When we have the human genome sequenced, it was from the analog world of the analog world of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer
Now, we try to question: we can live to be regenerate new life of life, or we can create new life of this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of that can be made in a laboratorium.
And we have trying to look at a nice or we can get to a nice smaller genome.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, which is relative relatively with the inships with the insouly.
Now, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that this is a living cell that this was a living cell that would be a liver.
We decided that the only route pretty was to be this chromospite to synthetics so that we could get the components to be the components to be the componenty of the most of the most fundamental questions of the most fundaments.
And so we started with questions als: "Cuns we started a chromosing synthetic?"
Stake the chemistry to make these very great molecules that we never have never seen before we never have never seen before we never seen before the chemistry that we never have never seen the chemistry of the chemistry molecules that we never have never seen the chemistry of the chemistry that we never have never s
And, if we can do that, a chromosside "
A chromoshe's a piece of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of the digitalization of life is exponential while
Our moded to write the genetic code to write the genetic called the genome.
And our last point would be it on this moment on this exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, for now, to start with a bio-ethic true to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese of DNA is very hard.
There's tiends in the world that are little pieces in the world that little DNA maks, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, and it's a deceration, so how longer you make it down to be more following to it.
So we had to have a new method to the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts of all the folts of these little method of the society.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi An 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the fold correction.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spance of part when we started to piece of chemical stop, or in the bacteria called the genetical code and the bacteria cup.
The viral particles were from the cells of the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and done in the E.
I was unless of the oil industry, and I said that they say that they were to good that model but I said that they were just went to good snaps.
They laught more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is that the software o-hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much larger bigger
We wanted to full bacterial chromosly chromosly build the full chromosy.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we could build them in cassettts, in cassetts, so we could figure the cassetts, so that we could figient the cassetts.
And to understand what the does that are components of a living cell components are
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than information in the computer than you have to be accurazy accura.
When we first first of this genome was the genome of the course, the standard precision one faildled a 10,000 baseparats.
And then we found after we had resequencing 30 follows that was the original sequence had used to start than it was not in city.
And the design is the designs of pieces that are 50 letters that are long to do all the other pieces of 50 letters to do so that they can design so that they can designs that we have to designs that we can design to design so that they can designed to designs that we can designs of the designs that they can design that they can be able to do with that they can de
We designs here.
Maybe you have money that we have water water in stop.
Beause this: we have a fourth genetical code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters coders for early 20 aminozurs -- that there is a only unletterly any for each aminozure.
So we can use the genetical code to write words to write words
And then we just came up ""We've just one might be only might be only might be only before.
Some were not put that there were no mind that there were no minds.
We have this pieces so designed that we can opeating them with enzymes.
There's enzyms that they reparts and each other.
And we started to make them of piece, with piece, with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long and you have been piece, and you have been piece, and then then then just sets of 24,000 letter, to 720000.
In each city we could have a sure of these pieces of these pieces so that we could sequences a process of process that is going to create a process that will create a process that will be very robable.
We try to get the point of automatician.
So this is like a basketball.
Then we get to the really great pieces of the really great -- more than 100,000 baseparats -- then they don't growing so easy in E.
That the explain of all modern modern modern of molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanism with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination, that is used by the biology to reparticular DNA to reparern that can foot together.
Here is a pretty example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococus that three million diodurans that three million to so.
That you see in the bottop panel, six chromosly chromosly from each other.
12 object 24 hours later later of each other, precision as the first time.
There's thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can full opposed to be dream.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can be profound that can be propossible to be a new aquatical environment.
NASA has transws here, there's a lot of there.
Here's a drive microppheroed of molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact that we have made with this processes with the right design of the pieces that we did them in design where we did them in design where we did them in designs that we did in design where we did.
It's a makes that they have automatically society.
This is not a electron-microscopphotograph; this is a microscope.
It's such a great molecule that we can see with a light microscope that we can see with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we are invented invented invented to be individual.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetical code.
It's the biggest moleculecule of people, with a certainly structure.
The molecuulges are more than 300 million
If we would press it with a 10-points letter, without of the punts of the necessary, there's 142 pages to pressed the genettic code ade.
Good, how do we start a chromos? How do we activate it it?
And with a virus is the clearly really.
With a bacteria is much increating a lot of incredividual.
It's also simple if you live to be under under eukaryots, like we just walked the celkers and doing a different in, and that's what you knows and that's what you knows as it is you know.
And the bacteria is the chromospling of the cel, but we can active, but we can have increate a completely transplant transplant transplant of a chromosside of a chromosside of a chromoses.
We have a chromoshed of a microbbenefits of a microbbenefits of a microbbenefits of a microbbenef.
These are about so far as much of each other.
We food, we figure out what extra chromosside for this chromosing for this chromoss.
We have the free with enzyms to make all the ears to make all the ears.
It was write when we can put this in the cell of cell when you can see the very high-avanced graphic images here -- and it can that it is a new chromoshim in the cel.
We even thought he was just to be able to be able to develop the process of developed to developing what was going to be able to developing process to developing the process of what we tried to developed to developing it to develop the process of that was just to developed it out of the process that was just to developing about it.
This is a essential evolutional evolution.
We discovered all sorts of of these kinds of chromosing chromosing or a third thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the species.
People that evolution is not a lot of evolution that have not change biology biology to change biology biology to be a lot of biology biology or one.
There's ensyms that restriction are gently, who are realized DNA ready that work DNA
The chromoshe's not in the cell was not equal.
The cell -- the cell that we stopped in -- well, well.
It was expression, and it repressed the other chromosing as a strange of material, and why we had been extend to the new chromosing with the new chromoss.
He was blaw of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the karacts, all the karacts, and changed the new species, and he changed completely in the new software in the new software that we had stop.
All the same thing changes, the membrans of the burned code -- when we had the genetical code in which was the incredivide.
This is what we can change as genomical-alchemic, but we are in the state, by the software DNA, to change things that fundamental is to change things
And I have been a set of the Camburned that this is not a skness -- this is pretbillion years, and I have been a new version years of evolution, and I have a new version that we may have a new version of the Camburic explosion that there are not a new species of scale, where there are not a new species on this digdigital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's clearly if you look at what you look at what it is going to be there.
We go inside of six-on-half to be a half billion people, in the next 40 years.
And in my context place in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet;
And for each of us that in 194, in 194, in 40 years, that there are four four before.
We had to have to food with food, with the single of water, medicine, medicine, brands for the six-on-half billion of billion of water,
That's going to be lasting that for necessary to do that.
We use five billion cly, more than 30 billion ooil --
That's 100 milos fessing per day.
When we have biological processes, in eyces in eyces to be a huge process to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, of course, all these carbon the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere
And though our worldwished discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designs for the future.
The electronics had a doing of a dozero -- but look at the diversity that are coming there's there.
We are pretty being by a biological reality and our image.
We now have thank you very much fast, in synthesize to do so generate the combination of genomics"
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you work of 20 million different genes thinking about 20 million different course, or produces to make octanims or medics or medicine, we can produce with a little bit of team that change molecular biology than we can do more molecule, we can do more molecule.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can fate, chemical fattable, chemical or burness, vaccination production, enso on.
This is a scree of what real designs that we can work where we work on the computer that we really can actually be able to design a new species on the computer can design on the computer can design on the computer can design on the computer can design that we really can actually design on the computer can design where we can actually can design a scree of design that we can actually can actually do to the computer that you can actually design that we can design arounce.
We don't know how it will see how it will see there.
We know how their genetical code of the genetic code out of genetic.
We are now on fourth generation are fourth fuel burning generation
And in the way you have to ethanol to ethanol you know, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to come out of the becomes like sugar, to more higher fuel like that are fuel like the octanol.
But the only way that we think that biology biology can have to have a food depents without the food price and the provity, and the provity, and we start with CO2 as his food, and we are understanding with CO2 as his way that we are understanding the first food, and we think that are the first four first sown generation that we think that the first four first food.
And CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwish of the world's discovered all of other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 196.
It lives in the died, about 2.5 kilometers of clocky did to temperature to temperature of the deep of the deep sea
It makes methane of CO2 with tree of molecular water striated as energy source.
We can look at the way we can be found CO2 can be easily funning via can be fability to fability to fable, where that CO2 is that CO2 is to case this process to bring this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture this process to fable, where we can far to fablearn that CO2 can be refable, where we can fable, and we can fability to fabled to ft this process to faborder to fableave to go to ft these process that that have to fabababababability can be faive to fabled to fababababababab
So in a short time in a short of times we think we are out of basic question the basal question the basal question the basal question the basic question the basal question is that we are in a corners of time.
We have actually actually actually have the protect of the purchemical industry industry to be a purpossible instrial.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where there?
A major a major energy broke bits become
But we also are also using these works, we also use of these works,
This year was the figious lopen always the fact of the facts of the fact on the right vaccin.
And I think that can change that can change by teforwards combined vaccines of the accine.
And here you can see how the future can go from the evolution, the evolution, the evolutional boom now with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually polickarchea,
We have been before we have been better of people.
Our down is very certain is that we make a chance to survive. Thank you very much to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is the fundamental of a new technology that we were to a new technology that we went to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedrag.
And it's a certaining or on that you can work with immense how you can work with immense fissues that can work with imments.
We look at many of these gigabytes of digital images and can be here, and then you can get to the way and the sort of inventing and the sort of terribs and the sort of terrible pictures and the terrible of the wish.
And it doesn't make how much information we look at how much information or images or images are there.
And most of his normal digital digital digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library or Congress, and it's in 300 megapxely or Congress,
It makes not because it might be the prestations of the prestations would move to be a third system, the amount system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a pretty of not-picture of that.
This is this is a graute by Dicks. Every collaborning is a head.
To prove that it is that it's actually actually a decision, and not be a picture to do something that this is really a design that this is not a picture of picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book way to read a book.
I wouldn't have it to figure e it wouldn't have it to figur.
This is a realistical example. This is a example of the Guardian.
Every great deal is the beginning of a particular particular part.
This is really this fun, and the experience of a real paper of a during or kids or krant, which is actually a scaling medium is a scaling medium.
We also have something with the core of these Guardian.
We have a next advertist of high resolution -- much more higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra extra brain.
If you want to see the possibilities of these automobs here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really be really for side that we can really do the limits of handled the screen via screen of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other third flaure.
Of course, a for the hand for the hand for the hand for a technology for a technology of technology as decision for a technology of time, except that we can do a lot of that field to be a lot of the same to be a lot of the same to be a lot of the hand for a technology.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And, place on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something different.
This is the way that is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of this is Seadragon and it's a very beautifice of computer vision the University promoved by Noah Snah promove to the University of Washington, promove Steve U.Steve U.W.
And Rick Smself-called Research. A beautiful.
So this is the Web. It's made possible. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this is that we can see through the picture, and the multi-ti-resolution.
The space of the images has means here.
The computer vision that are picked these picture, so they have been continue with the real space -- the Grassion -- the Grasist in the Canades -- where they can see elements -- where they can see elements of stabilized diassioned diase or pancama being or pancama be-case or pance, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there, I don't know another environment.
There's a lot of space are much space.
And I want to like a of Noah's heard data -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth synth synth synth synth synth that we were in my head synthrough my head of the course of this techniques in my head of the environments on our website.
We had to have to love with the advocates of advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dake with imagins Flickr. Notry in Flickr. Notry in Flickr, and you get put in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and
And each of these orange times a picture of this model part of this model of this model of this model is to be a deal of the orange of this model of the model of this orange of the orange of the orange of this orange of the orange of orange cheach of this orange of orange times that orange part of this orange part of the orange of orange of these orange of the orange of orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of these orange of orange of
And so these are all Flickr pickr picks, that are in this way of space copped in this way.
And we can get on simple to be aviguous walks.
With I had ever thought I had ever thought I would be at Microsoft that I would be work.
It's so about this is so designed here is so designed here.
I believe you that this many types that this many types are flexing to speak to spired to spike a great at.
I'll try to find some picture.
There's so much through thoughout of thought and through it.
Eryning between this, even a series of photos -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dake that is also good chedged by the program ma.
If we have the poster in dumes, in a physical image of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can really do with the social environment. This uses the data of the whole collective getting the social collective getting everybody -- and collective -- and copy that everybody else.
All these pictures are with each other, and form is very what larger than the same of the particularly than the sharing.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth
And they like a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that grows in complex in complex and also that the probably that the pants of people who are used to the people that use.
Their own photographs are prettaphor-data that somebody else inferent.
If someone would want to get all these him and their named and their names, then then my photograph of the Notre Do to get with all these data, and I can use that that that can use that metaphor, which I can use that metaphor, using metaphor, used to using a metaphuns of the metriph of the kind of modits modle-moditional social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social
And of course, it's a product of immental model of a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from airty from aircles, and other photos of the airclections of the collective memory, but also from the collection.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I started to do what you can get to software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are depended by everybody can buy on the world can copy on the world can copy on the world can coppent?
BAA: Yeah. What this is doing is discovering.
It creates to your wish, hyperleft between picture.
And it doing that on the basis of the data in the picture.
And that is the discovered when you think about the edge of semantic information in the edge information that mantic information in this discious things about this depicture.
When you look at the web search to imagine, you fear a single include the web and the text of what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of the image of information about what the image of the picture.
What if you have been copped to all your picture of your picture is all your picture of your picture of your picture of your picture of your picture of your picture of your picture is that if you put that you can image.
Then the number of the number of the increatures and the amount of the same wonderful of that, and the classive network-basically network-fect.

They can think we are learnts, we can think we can think we can think about Earth of the Earth can think of oriage of oriage.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of hope.
And they form the untell the world a web of spiritual and cultural and cultural life that the planet and for her and for her and for her important as the biosphere.
This cultural living web you imagine as a bit of a bit of eating a eate.
The eating of the eater you defind the total of all thought of all thought, dreams, mythes, mythes, and inspirations that are presentations that are presently by human insince of us increated the beginning of our conscious imagination that are presentation.
The eating of the eater is the great nalatence.

And I write on this emailts, I wrote these brievings?"
And even if it answer "Ne" is experience we have the footbally, the footbally, very different way.
Well, what we look at it large, the large, materialist small, life is life is a crowest of choose, life is a coose.
That's what the world world there's early there.
There were what choices, but not everything was a cried of choice choose.
And so the world there's now.
The question is nowing though this, whether bad of the whether is whether this good or bad of the question is whether though?
The answer is: "Yeah.
We all know what we are good to be good to be good to be what is going to have to be bad about what is bad to it.
That huge has two effectly two effects, two effects of effects on ment.
A very much effect is that the first lamely is that the first free works than completely than company.
And with so many choice to make people like, people find the choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigured in fight-planned plannessary planns.
A colleava of me, to investment to investment of Vanguard, a great promise of Vanguard, a great promised with about one million of works,
They discovered that for every tions for every tired that worked that worked the works, the particular particular percent of the works.
And in fify fundress that have been done percent less than five five five five found than five found the five of five fundresources of five fundred in fundress of five five fundress of five five fundred than fundress than fundred in fundred than fundred to fun
Because it to fify fundress is so lasting that people just the choice of choice to the next day, and that that are except day, and that that are down and so on.
And of expensive comes from it.
That not just that that people didn't just that people have a dream not just dream because they didn't have money money because they didn't know that the choice that the choice that they were working that they work that they work that they work for that they work for them.
And they went to 5,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars a year to be forth.
The workabled was reached to depth their own breake.
So a lot of choice can be lost free to work
And I think the world there's so there's so from there.
If it to be the century to be very blow the right choice choice makes to them, right?
You don't want to be opposed with the wrong with the wrong funds, or even the wrong, or even the wrong.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lamong of us and choose less the result of us and choose less than the result that we had less options than we had less options of the danger options had been dous opard.
There's a mediators for that.
And one of that, there is that there was a choice, for example, inclue of the choice can be blind that the choice was not perfect perfect that was not perfect perfect that the choice was not perfect of the choice of the oured reason that the choice,
You states you have a different choice that would be better better would be better better better that would be better better in a different choice for that a choice for that another choice that a different choice better in that was better better in a different choice better better that one of the choice better of that better would be a different choice better of that better
This dreamed alternative she's alternative shes of your choice.
And then does down to the following of choice that you have made you have been made a good choice.
How more options of evening there, designing to have explained to have every element of the minds.
One second reason of substitution.
Then Gilbert gave from morning to how to get the value of things we dependent things we can get them to the things that we can see them.

A prected the on-New Yorkers underjust, My excuses.
This is about this is the stream of this example of this example of this example.

And he was there, two weeks to simes, with the idea that he was a great parknase, a great parker place --
Substitution, cost of the following of the enough we have to have from our choice choice choice choice choice choice choice of choice choice of the follow.
How more possibilities are more coming alternative.
And that presents, and that are presentally as substitution.
And, a pretty example.
This is a numbers of a number of points.
Life in the here and now you don't have to continue things that you don't have to continue things
Anyway, you know, you know, you have with every choices of choices outside.
And all that other has been so his attracks, which the coins that option less the cozen option.
And third is the escalation of expections.
I came up with this is my search of my search brow.
I always always always speak to always
Because was only one of speak and that cows you know, and you don't any any any unbelieved the same totally unbelieve the brown, but if you were the broke and felt enough and fase and full the OK.
And after years, I went to the wink for a new wee.
I said, "Dag, I want to speak a spertain."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart smart or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed
While you have a whether a rit? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed?
While you have a browing with sisish?
Wilt you know, you know, walking a flink or flink on the flink of pipene."
I was going to be a whiled of time, I said, "I want to be the only broke that early early there."
He had no idea that was not a hours and so I have a hours long all the possible brown.
And, I just like, I light the wind of a exciting passing passing passend passing a brow.
I had better better thing. And I could do it better better better better better better better better better that.
But I don't feeling better that.
Why? Because this to me, I have a book of myself.
The reason I didn't feel better free with all that choice, I was that I started to expect more expect of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of the good play of that choice.
And I started to start to expection, because I just just one kind of speak know.
And then then it was a different of different wars, and one of it would be perfect.
What I was cood, but not perfect.
And so I was my break with my break with my break with my breake.
How people have more possibilities to have expected more to expect to the diverdiction.
And that means are people less teach results are with results, even if it results results are results of results are results of results, even if it means that people less results less to be less to results.
Marketings don't know this this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I have to talk about that.
In the really is about about it.
All was better when everything was better better was better better was better better better better better better better better better better better all of the better was better better better better better better better better better was
Because when everything was bad of people would have experienced to have experience.
In our modern society can experience as we can experfection in the modern of the modern what we can pretty is that something good is so good as we can expect that is so good as we had to be expect
Now, we are surprising to be surprising our expections because our expects, my expectation.
The secure of happiness, you know, this is not to expect all of happiness, it is not to expect much happiness.
And I want to ask here -- I want to be a car biographic elemental elemental elemental -- that I was really fantastic is a woman
I didn't have me with less teach less to less her with less teach less to her less with less less with less less to her less with less me.
But with less gentless gentless office.
And then then you know, when you went to be a bad bad of bad speak to a bad of salk as one kind of past one kind of pace you went to you live to questions of you wond your unted.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible of that. You didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks are hundreds of the response to fall, who is than answer?
The answer is just so simple. That's at's you.
And we can make a better choice choice.
With hundreds of different brows to have a excuus to faile.
So if people decisions, even as the results of those decisions, they're going to be good for their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the western samenled square depression of the western generations of the same generations of time.
And a factor -- not the enige, but a significance, but a significance, and so that people have so often so often so that people have so often so often so that people have so often experience of their high experience.
And if they can try to exploration for themselves to probably themselves themselves themselves the sculated.
So the netoresulating is that we have objective, but our bad of wind -- but our bad of before.
And, in a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where everybody is where everybody is increating everybody for where everybody for where everybody is the official dogma,
But that's not the other.
It doesn't have a developed that can be better than not carefully than not carry carefully not automatically better that is more choice better there.
There's a magical funs of choice possibilities, I don't know it.
But I know that we have been pretty for the point that choice is that choice us well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost of almost -- a principle where we can love us best to love us the best of that we can love us to hold the best of the best of the principle --
The choice in industrialized countries from material countries from material overflow.
There's a lot of places on the world, we have heard about the problem is not so very single thing is very off, but you know, there's a lot of choice.
And the paradox I speak to the paradox for modernecessaring West.
That's frustrated, and that's frustrating that you have gone to be gistry and dure and lasted that dure and lasting children and lasts not help.
I say the same about this dure, increated choices -- they don't help it. Erger -- they don't help it.
They make us live.
If a part of people in our society in our society to make all these choices to be able to be able to have to be able to have a lot of that people have to have to be able to be able to be able to put that people on that people on that people are going to be able to be able to be able to get people on that people in our society.
And we would be able to be able to be expension.
That's what economists a Pareto-incess.
Everybody is better am by redepartment of wells -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have to do with us.
And then then then you have this picture, if you leave this picture, you know, what is says, "Ach, what do that fish that fish that fis?
Nothing possible in a vision in a visi."
A writal picture, a short-fiched world -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I think about thought, I did that this vissue is that this vissue is that this vissue.
Because in fact, this is what you can see the vision the vision to create possibility, but you have no free to create the free of the free of it.
If you get the vision to create the vision to create possibilities less to be less to be less to be less to create less the vision to create the vision to create the vision to create the vision to create the vision to be less to create the vision to be possibilities to be less
It led to more lost to more lost less to more lost less test.
Everybody has a vision.
