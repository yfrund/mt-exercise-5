In 2@@ 5 years is the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ?
And that's a proble@@ m because the be@@ qu@@ e of the N@@ or@@ n I@@ J@@ s@@ he was the N@@ or@@ d@@ ou@@ s and h@@ er h@@ er and there was a very very very very g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing and there are a very very very very g@@ ro@@ ss the de@@ sig@@ n@@ .

W@@ h@@ ! O@@ K@@ . It's r@@ igh@@ t@@ ? It's going to be w@@ he@@ ther that we will be able to be w@@ he@@ ther that we will be going to be going to be w@@ he@@ .
A re@@ as@@ on for this is that this en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s were te@@ br@@ on@@ on the n@@ or@@ m@@ s of the ne@@ or@@ d@@ s, and from the no@@ or@@ d@@ s.
This is a s@@ m@@ el@@ y of at@@ er@@ ri@@ v@@ e.

This is the K@@ an@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ s in S@@ u@@ e G@@ ro@@ en@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ d.
I@@ f you know how to know how the es@@ p@@ ic@@ e is the sp@@ on@@ e, because it's the l@@ and@@ ing is the pl@@ ac@@ e in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .

They can be with the h@@ and they are f@@ a@@ il@@ y and they can be able to f@@ ir@@ d their h@@ igh@@ t, their con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ , their f@@ at@@ s and they f@@ at@@ es a sc@@ re@@ e and s@@ ha@@ p@@ s and they d@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s is the f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ al h@@ and@@ el@@ s of the b@@ lo@@ c@@ k of the b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ es of the b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ es of the b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ er@@ s.
B@@ o@@ t@@ ab@@ les are S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les a new ec@@ o@@ sy@@ ste@@ m for the way of the way for the way of the way of in@@ form@@ ation mat@@ ic@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of in@@ form@@ ation mat@@ y.
And then this he@@ ar@@ d that this he@@ ar@@ d was a more f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ al differ@@ ent en@@ c@@ e, and even be@@ ing the the way of their o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of their o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s and even the way we are of the way we we we know them and the way we are the way we know the@@ y@@ 're going to de@@ sig@@ n them and new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ y new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ ies of the way and new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ s.
I will st@@ ar@@ ts with en@@ v@@ ed ex@@ am@@ ple@@ s.
This S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , is in@@ st@@ ic@@ ally in@@ st@@ ic@@ ally by the o@@ b@@ er and pro@@ v@@ ed by the o@@ ther@@ , which is the c@@ it@@ er@@ ate and chan@@ ge@@ , and the s@@ ame bac@@ k and chan@@ ge@@ d to the c@@ it@@ y.
The@@ se inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve p@@ or@@ it@@ s are of c@@ u@@ re@@ s.
In@@ di@@ en@@ ce and n@@ ame up in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , they will be for e@@ ac@@ h inter@@ est@@ ing of inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing of inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing of inter@@ est@@ ing.
I@@ f they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be what they can be able to be able to be and what they can be be@@ come to be be@@ come to be@@ come and what they can be be@@ come to be be@@ come to be@@ come and what they can be be@@ come to be@@ come and what they can be be@@ come to be@@ come to be be@@ come and what they can be to be to be@@ come and al@@ so and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the s@@ on@@ e.
And then they were f@@ el@@ s and they w@@ ent out and they w@@ ent out and h@@ om@@ e.
We re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed al@@ wa@@ y, al@@ ga@@ u@@ al that one of inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing this inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, as the in@@ si@@ de of all the inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, as the b@@ ar@@ y, as the t@@ oo@@ l@@ .
In this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of this ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ em@@ s for them and I can use them to use them them them in a little b@@ ad of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the g@@ ie@@ s, where they are g@@ one in a li@@ g@@ h@@ er of the wor@@ d@@ s.
I@@ f we have d@@ re@@ s, we have what we have bac@@ k to what we we we do what we do what we do what we do what we do@@ .
Th@@ ere are some of the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ s of the e@@ duc@@ ation@@ , for the e@@ duc@@ ation@@ , which is the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ s of the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ s of the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ s and the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ s of people want to tr@@ y to tr@@ ie@@ d to do things we want to tr@@ y to see the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar and the re@@ s@@ ul@@ l@@ y.
And here I think this is -- this is the un@@ de@@ vel@@ op@@ ment of a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ c@@ i was by a si@@ mp@@ le of a f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er of re@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
And here we have a sp@@ e@@ a@@ ge that a c@@ ru@@ is@@ i@@ on and B@@ og@@ g@@ le@@ .
The p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e is that you have in e@@ i@@ p@@ e in e@@ very e@@ very S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ or@@ , and then the wor@@ ds of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , and the wor@@ ds of the wor@@ ds of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , and the wor@@ ds of the wor@@ ds of the wor@@ ds of the wor@@ d@@ s.
Af@@ ter 3@@ 0 se@@ con@@ ds about 3@@ 0 se@@ con@@ ds is really really really re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e, and differ@@ ent to the new s@@ er@@ y of the b@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ s with h@@ or@@ ing mo@@ v@@ ed mo@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ y.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
The@@ se are some k@@ id@@ s on ex@@ c@@ ur@@ si@@ on to the M@@ e@@ di@@ a and I a@@ ge in the M@@ e@@ di@@ a and I'm going to tr@@ y and a vi@@ de@@ o of ma@@ k@@ es and a vi@@ de@@ o of ma@@ g@@ in@@ .
They were very we@@ 've been very we@@ d@@ ing.
And one of the most inter@@ est@@ ing things that most inter@@ est@@ ing things that people are not in@@ stru@@ c@@ t that people are not in@@ stru@@ c@@ t@@ y in@@ stru@@ c@@ t@@ s.
A@@ l@@ l you have to sa@@ y "@@ M@@ a@@ y wor@@ ds and they know what they ne@@ ed to do the@@ y@@ 're do@@ ing what they ne@@ ed to do the@@ m.
H@@ ere are some other people to the te@@ st@@ s.
Th@@ at's our b@@ a@@ ge@@ st b@@ ig@@ ge@@ st b@@ ig@@ ge@@ ,
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use he loo@@ ks like the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ w@@ er of the S@@ i@@ f@@ le@@ .
F@@ or he@@ m it were c@@ alle@@ d this s@@ le@@ d and it was c@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ s.
H@@ er@@ e's a inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve of pro@@ te@@ d.
We wan@@ ted to tal@@ k to the l@@ ast of the l@@ on@@ g of t@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ s.
This is F@@ el@@ i@@ x that de@@ m@@ b@@ er in the de@@ m@@ ou@@ s.
H@@ e can we ne@@ ed a new c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ s in the sc@@ er@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ s, by the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ .
H@@ ere he was the s@@ ou@@ s@@ on the s@@ ou@@ s.
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : The is com@@ es com@@ es out of the com@@ e.
D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ er@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ : N@@ o you have a tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or in the sc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : The or@@ an@@ g@@ .
G@@ o@@ d was th@@ ough@@ ! Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ !
And then the sch@@ u@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ly of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ s the c@@ ur@@ e of S@@ i@@ f@@ t of S@@ i@@ f@@ t the c@@ ar@@ a@@ g@@ s in with the c@@ ar@@ ac@@ h -- where he was re@@ ad -- where he was re@@ ad@@ y c@@ lo@@ c@@ k with with the c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ .
D@@ M@@ : M@@ : M@@ : The stor@@ y stor@@ y stor@@ y of do@@ w@@ n@@ .
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : H@@ all@@ o@@ !
D@@ M@@ : It's a stor@@ y with a stor@@ y and e@@ in@@ de@@ .
and he de@@ c@@ is@@ t the stor@@ y.
F@@ ide@@ : The c@@ ou@@ t. The f@@ l@@ .
D@@ M@@ : The l@@ ast ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , I will be able to tal@@ k to the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ an sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ al ch@@ il@@ it@@ er@@ s and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , where we have the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ a@@ d, and the b@@ as@@ s as the b@@ as@@ s as the b@@ as@@ s as the b@@ as@@ s as the b@@ as@@ s and and and and a b@@ as@@ s as a sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of the b@@ as@@ s and a sy@@ th@@ .
E@@ n@@ er@@ v@@ ar@@ i@@ ation@@ s, which you can use in your o@@ b@@ it@@ e and you want to use your o@@ b@@ .
This is the s@@ ame time@@ s can be in lif@@ e in S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ ge of the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed that you can be the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
You know, you get a lo@@ t of the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed by the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s of a li@@ ve S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , there are his con@@ t@@ ro@@ l@@ er@@ b@@ le as f@@ il@@ ter@@ .
They are going to be a lo@@ c@@ k and h@@ ol@@ d and h@@ igh@@ t, and they are p@@ as@@ t by chan@@ ge@@ s.
And then the al@@ th@@ ough al@@ th@@ ough the al@@ re@@ d of te@@ m@@ pl@@ y and p@@ at@@ ter@@ s and p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s and p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at it.
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ e@@ 're star@@ ted with a le@@ a@@ ge in two S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ s, a first p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ , le@@ a@@ ge of the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed by a p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed by a p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
No@@ w I think I le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed the b@@ as@@ l@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ ell, I fe@@ el what I fe@@ el I fe@@ el what I fe@@ el was wor@@ k in the s@@ la@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ .
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ ell, no@@ w I think I think I think I think I p@@ ut the f@@ il@@ ter of the d@@ ru@@ m@@ s, I think that the ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t of li@@ ve in the p@@ ast f@@ il@@ ter li@@ ve to the f@@ l@@ as@@ e li@@ ve of li@@ ve in the f@@ il@@ ter of li@@ ve li@@ ve to the f@@ il@@ ter of the d@@ ru@@ m@@ s,
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ ell, I can really really really really really really really really ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ s and the can@@ c@@ al and the can@@ c@@ al b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ e.
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ ell, I think I think about what you is the f@@ il@@ ter for more ex@@ pre@@ s@@ s@@ ed to the f@@ il@@ ter of the con@@ pre@@ s@@ s@@ si@@ on.
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : M@@ : M@@ : I can do it in the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
I don't he@@ ar a@@ ga@@ in@@ , but I don't have an@@ y@@ thing to plan@@ n@@ , but I can tr@@ y and it very l@@ on@@ g@@ er and c@@ or@@ , and it very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and I wan@@ ted to do as I wan@@ ted to do that@@ .
And the ex@@ t@@ in@@ ly of the di@@ m@@ s of the e@@ qu@@ e of the ne@@ u@@ m S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
And if you can see my p@@ as@@ si@@ on on the ma@@ king of new hu@@ man inter@@ fac@@ es that we are going to be able to be able to the way that the way that are be@@ t@@ ter and the way that are in the way that that is in the way of the way of the way of our b@@ ra@@ in the way to the way to the way our b@@ ra@@ in the way and wor@@ k@@ s.
And I as@@ ked to the time to the time I was al@@ so the time in this de@@ sig@@ n in this de@@ sig@@ n in this de@@ sig@@ n and s@@ ing@@ le with e@@ ac@@ h mo@@ v@@ ed and s@@ k@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ s and in the l@@ ab@@ le@@ .
The da@@ y I want to tal@@ k about this is that I want to tal@@ k about this is that this is this is this is a new gen@@ er@@ ation to a very new gen@@ er@@ ation of the In@@ ac@@ ter@@ s and with the In@@ ac@@ ter@@ s and with the In@@ ac@@ ter@@ s of the worl@@ d, that in@@ form@@ ation of the worl@@ d@@ 's in@@ form@@ ation of our wor@@ ld and we wan@@ ted to our wor@@ ld and we wan@@ ted to our wor@@ ld and we wan@@ ted to our b@@ re@@ ad@@ y the in@@ form@@ ation of the worl@@ d.
I th@@ an@@ k you he@@ ar@@ t.
I look at all of all of all the p@@ r@@ at@@ es.
I a@@ m w@@ r@@ it@@ e stor@@ y.
B@@ u@@ t, you know, it's al@@ so mu@@ ch more than that@@ .
M@@ y wh@@ ol@@ e lif@@ e I don't think that e@@ ver will be a l@@ on@@ g and I don't think that e@@ ver will not be able to chan@@ ge that e@@ ver will be able to chan@@ ge that e@@ ver will be able to chan@@ ge@@ .
And then there is something about the un@@ n@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be something in my o@@ wn and c@@ alle@@ d in my lif@@ e and I was in my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k and mo@@ v@@ e.
The be@@ g@@ an with a b@@ oo@@ k, I was un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s a me@@ mo@@ re@@ , "@@ E@@ t@@ s, B@@ id@@ d@@ s, B@@ id@@ d@@ s, B@@ an@@ g@@ s in te@@ x@@ t to my wor@@ k and the wor@@ k wor@@ k about the worl@@ d, and the wor@@ k wor@@ k about the worl@@ d.
The people have to tal@@ k about that people are al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to tal@@ k about that I have to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed or I me@@ .

You don't have you to be your wh@@ ol@@ e and not you have you li@@ ve to be able to be able to be more than a b@@ oo@@ k, but ne@@ ver ne@@ ver a b@@ ook of the b@@ oo@@ k, and a b@@ oo@@ k, and wh@@ at's going to be able to make people that people for the s@@ ul@@ l@@ ing for the people who are going to be able to be able to re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch for people in the c@@ u@@ re@@ .
And you don't get ther@@ e@@ ?"
E@@ ver@@ n@@ y st@@ at@@ e@@ d, you know, you know, you know, you know,
No@@ w, I re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er would be very re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er that I was re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er -- I was a little b@@ it -- I was a little b@@ it -- I was a lo@@ t of the r@@ igh@@ t.
P@@ e@@ op@@ le sa@@ id, "@@ B@@ en you don't ne@@ ver get your b@@ an@@ g and you ne@@ ver get to get your n@@ oo@@ d@@ ?
You don't have your b@@ an@@ g and not the b@@ an@@ g and b@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ing with e@@ duc@@ ation@@ ?
You don't have you le@@ ar@@ n that you le@@ ar@@ d to this wor@@ k and that there was a wor@@ k of the be@@ ing of the ma@@ g@@ in@@ s that there is something that you have been in the p@@ ou@@ s of your b@@ ro@@ d@@ s, and you b@@ it@@ ter@@ s in your b@@ it@@ ter@@ s of your b@@ it@@ al b@@ it@@ ter@@ s of f@@ al@@ en@@ t@@ ?"
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing in that st@@ re@@ .
In the c@@ or@@ t com@@ es on that my an@@ s@@ w@@ er on that f@@ ra@@ in@@ s hi@@ er@@ : "@@ Y@@ e@@ a@@ ."
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ , I'm going to be all all the things that that that are be@@ come to be be@@ come to be be@@ come with that@@ .
A@@ l@@ al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ y.
And I'm al@@ so mu@@ ch more things that you don't know that that ever@@ y@@ thing for all of all all of that that things for all all all of all all of that@@ .
F@@ or ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , for ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and other th@@ ing, and other thing@@ s, and other thing@@ s.
But what me@@ an@@ s to be able to get the l@@ ast time@@ , I w@@ ent to the l@@ ast time@@ , the l@@ ast time@@ , where that that an@@ g@@ st time@@ .
I@@ s it r@@ ation@@ al e@@ y@@ ?
I@@ s it was al@@ on@@ ce that some@@ bo@@ dy is be@@ come to the wor@@ k for the wor@@ k for the wor@@ k for the wor@@ k for the wor@@ k for their hu@@ man on the be@@ ing of the ma@@ k@@ es are sa@@ id to the ma@@ k@@ ?
Wh@@ at is so mu@@ ch more cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ un@@ ity to the ef@@ ec@@ ts of the ef@@ ec@@ ts of the o@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts of the en@@ ti@@ g@@ s of the en@@ ti@@ g@@ h@@ t of the en@@ ti@@ g@@ er@@ al worl@@ d.
No@@ w, I c@@ all my f@@ a@@ ther@@ . H@@ e was hi@@ stor@@ y and I don't re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er in 4@@ 0 years wor@@ ked in the 4@@ 0 years wor@@ k@@ y in the 4@@ 0 years who was not an@@ y in 4@@ 0 years who was not an@@ y in the 4@@ 0 or he@@ 's d@@ an@@ g or he@@ 's not an@@ g for hi@@ m.
And so this is "@@ Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ , how you is the ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ de@@ ?"
No@@ w, not so mu@@ ch more about it.
O@@ m f@@ a@@ i@@ r is the re@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ on of the e@@ u@@ re@@ s and not the re@@ pe@@ a@@ in the e@@ w@@ s and a re@@ pe@@ t@@ ation for stu@@ dy stu@@ den@@ ce and de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ de of stu@@ di@@ c@@ o@@ li@@ st@@ s and the re@@ ad of the e@@ ac@@ o@@ h@@ .
S@@ ch@@ re@@ s that have some of re@@ p@@ u@@ t@@ ation@@ .
No@@ t on@@ ly al@@ on@@ ly al@@ so other cre@@ ati@@ ve people have been re@@ pre@@ t@@ t@@ ation of the re@@ pe@@ t@@ ation is in@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ y in@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ it@@ y.
S@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at the g@@ ri@@ m@@ ate do@@ ing the most most of the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve and the 2@@ 0@@ th of the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y.
And the st@@ i@@ er@@ v@@ es and st@@ il@@ y by o@@ wn o@@ wn and do@@ .
And even even the s@@ ame thing that that don't have mo@@ or@@ d pl@@ e@@ g@@ s, and they are their ga@@ in@@ st their ga@@ in@@ .
In the l@@ ast inter@@ v@@ ie@@ w for his d@@ oo@@ d@@ 's he@@ a@@ d, M@@ il@@ er@@ : M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ ."
Th@@ at's no@@ g@@ al to sa@@ y to you about what you li@@ ve to wor@@ k.
But of this kind of ex@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion@@ .
We all have he@@ ar@@ d the time and have he@@ ar@@ d and have ac@@ c@@ ep@@ te@@ s and all ac@@ c@@ ep@@ te@@ d.
The he@@ ar@@ d is that re@@ al re@@ al re@@ al f@@ at@@ i@@ v@@ ity and that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is with the l@@ on@@ g and that ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic in@@ st@@ and that is a ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic in@@ st@@ ic@@ ally con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ .
And wh@@ y I want to do an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy here is that I think about this qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is that you can with ide@@ a that you can with ide@@ a that with ide@@ a of lif@@ e with ide@@ a of lif@@ ?
D@@ o you know that O@@ K@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use I think about n@@ a@@ ge@@ , I think about it.
I fin@@ d it we@@ k@@ e.
And al@@ so al@@ so on@@ ce an@@ y s@@ k@@ s.
I don't like this this e@@ w that this e@@ u@@ e e@@ u@@ e as w@@ ell@@ .
We can cre@@ ati@@ ve to be mu@@ ch more and to le@@ a@@ ve and to lif@@ e.
I know that it was a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , you would look at that to le@@ a@@ ge that would be d@@ on@@ e.
S@@ t@@ ar@@ y the f@@ as@@ e that in my c@@ ar@@ ri@@ bu@@ t@@ t@@ y in my c@@ ar@@ ri@@ bu@@ t@@ t@@ s.
G@@ er@@ e's n@@ a@@ : I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , you know,
I can be ma@@ y@@ be more we@@ 've been be@@ ing f@@ our de@@ cen@@ t@@ s.
H@@ oo@@ g@@ st@@ er@@ ally all I will all I will be all I will be able to be able to be able to be the b@@ oo@@ l@@ s of the b@@ oo@@ l@@ s that the b@@ oo@@ k.

So I don't want to do that@@ .
I lo@@ ve me lo@@ ve to the wor@@ k with the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of where I lo@@ ve in the wor@@ k of where I lo@@ ve in the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of where I lo@@ ve in the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is "@@ H@@ oo@@ ?"
Af@@ ter the l@@ on@@ g con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on and I think that all all of the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on can be able to be a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al be@@ au@@ ti@@ c in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ .

S@@ te@@ l you don't know that that that the most of the most un@@ as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of your e@@ as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of your b@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ s from your e@@ very si@@ de of your e@@ as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of your e@@ as@@ e of your e@@ y@@ es.

Th@@ at I bel@@ ie@@ ve that I bel@@ ie@@ ve in he@@ ar@@ t.
"@@ O@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ , what we do is wor@@ k with the p@@ ur@@ e hu@@ man s@@ on@@ g@@ er and the o@@ wn and the o@@ wn and the o@@ wn and pro@@ per@@ t@@ s.

Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ : O@@ l@@ !
You know, I just just just just just all the si@@ m@@ pl@@ y of these pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about the hu@@ man en@@ g@@ in@@ s, about the hu@@ man ne@@ e@@ ds and it ma@@ de and the de@@ sig@@ n of new se@@ ts of new se@@ ts of se@@ con@@ c@@ tion@@ .

"@@ Wh@@ at is something that I think about what I think is something that that man@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ist@@ s have tr@@ ie@@ d to un@@ der@@ st@@ and differ@@ ent to un@@ der@@ st@@ and differ@@ ent in@@ si@@ on@@ s.
We have differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ a@@ der@@ s in the un@@ der@@ st@@ and the ter@@ u@@ re@@ , the ter@@ u@@ re@@ s to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s.
We are the b@@ in@@ ce 2@@ 0 years of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ er@@ s.
And when we have se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce to the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e in the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y, to the g@@ it@@ al wor@@ ld of the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
No@@ w we tr@@ y to as@@ k and we tr@@ y to re@@ gen@@ er@@ ate re@@ gen@@ er@@ at@@ e, or new le@@ w of this di@@ g@@ it@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ ?
This is the ma@@ g@@ in@@ s of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ing or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ing c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation for a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation of that is a s@@ m@@ all of that in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ y in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation@@ .
And we have tr@@ ying to look at a n@@ ic@@ e of the in@@ cre@@ as@@ e we can get a little b@@ it of in@@ cre@@ as@@ e and make a little b@@ it of in@@ .
We can be in or@@ der the or@@ d@@ re@@ d of the 5@@ 00 or that there are going to be 5@@ 00 or or that there are like that@@ .
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ t, that's rel@@ ati@@ ve e@@ very si@@ mp@@ le of si@@ m@@ pl@@ y with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
G@@ oo@@ m is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e.
But when we look at all the c@@ alle@@ d we can look at all the c@@ ou@@ s that we can look at the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , it's a very un@@ ti@@ l of the c@@ el@@ y c@@ el@@ y of the c@@ el@@ y c@@ el@@ y would be a li@@ ving the c@@ el@@ y of the c@@ op@@ le@@ .
We de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that the on@@ ly r@@ ight no@@ thing that was to pro@@ duc@@ t this this is to sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ m@@ s and sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ m@@ s and that we could the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts and the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts and to the most of the most of the most of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ al to the most of the most of the most of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ s.
And we star@@ ted with this qu@@ est@@ i@@ ons of the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on to a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ m@@ ?
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ i@@ on that the ch@@ em@@ i@@ on to make a g@@ ro@@ te that we ne@@ ver ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver s@@ een to make that we ne@@ ver s@@ een to see an@@ y@@ ?
E@@ n@@ , if we can do that a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed to the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ s@@ oo@@ m "@@ op@@ st@@ er@@ s@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e is tr@@ an@@ s@@ op@@ er@@ ate mat@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ .
So, us of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ i@@ on of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ i@@ on is in@@ si@@ on of the ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al e@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
O@@ u@@ r to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ d to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ d of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the gen@@ om@@ s.
And our l@@ ast po@@ in@@ t to this m@@ om@@ ent pl@@ ac@@ e on a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
We are more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a c@@ it@@ e for di@@ a for di@@ a to star@@ ted with a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic@@ al s@@ k@@ in@@ s of the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A mo@@ ther@@ .
Th@@ ere are ti@@ en@@ ds of the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the worl@@ d, 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 li@@ fe@@ t@@ ter@@ s and it's a de@@ sig@@ n of the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , and it's more f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er and the more f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er and it's more f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er in the wor@@ ld is more than the more than the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld that is more f@@ ol@@ ic@@ e of the worl@@ d.
So we had to make a new me@@ th@@ th@@ o@@ d for the ma@@ k@@ es for the ma@@ king of these s@@ m@@ all these little p@@ ie@@ c@@ es of all the f@@ oo@@ t@@ s.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing with the di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ a is 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little vi@@ ru@@ s that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a is b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We de@@ sig@@ n the stu@@ d@@ ge@@ s of the p@@ ie@@ ce of c@@ or@@ re@@ , the f@@ ol@@ t@@ y --
and then had a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing de@@ sig@@ n and we star@@ ted a p@@ ie@@ ce of the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and f@@ ir@@ al c@@ o@@ se and f@@ ir@@ al c@@ le@@ s@@ s, and f@@ ir@@ al c@@ oun@@ ds of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ s.
The f@@ ir@@ al de@@ d of the worl@@ d, they were going to be the c@@ ell@@ s, they were c@@ ell@@ s, they were bac@@ k and then then then then then then they were bac@@ k and then then then the E@@ c@@ .
I was un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s in the ol@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ ie@@ , and I sa@@ id they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they had to do it was to g@@ ood s@@ l@@ y.
They are more than you@@ .
Th@@ at wh@@ y we think this sit@@ u@@ ation in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m and in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m and in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m and he@@ ar@@ d and he@@ ar@@ w@@ ing this sit@@ u@@ ation sy@@ ste@@ st@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to do something mu@@ ch of the g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
We wan@@ ted to be the ne@@ x@@ t b@@ as@@ ter@@ i@@ a and ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ing and bu@@ il@@ ding
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e c@@ o@@ de@@ .
And so we could bu@@ il@@ d them to bu@@ il@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s of f@@ a@@ se@@ t@@ s like to f@@ ir@@ us@@ s@@ es, so we un@@ der@@ st@@ and so we f@@ ar@@ i@@ an@@ s.
to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s are com@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ ies of a li@@ ving comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a li@@ ving comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a li@@ ving comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a lif@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n is c@@ ru@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ , and if you star@@ ted with the comp@@ u@@ ter in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter in@@ form@@ ation and ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in is very ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And when we star@@ ted to the first time@@ , this is the first time@@ s of the first time@@ s in 1@@ 9@@ 5 was 1@@ 9@@ 5 was 1@@ 9@@ 5 per@@ c@@ ent of the p@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 5 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ t@@ s.
And in the c@@ it@@ er@@ ally we di@@ d to re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion 3@@ 0 p@@ p@@ ec@@ ted the way we di@@ d wa@@ s@@ n't have the wa@@ s@@ n't have the in@@ si@@ de of the time@@ .
O@@ u@@ r par@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n that 5@@ 0 lif@@ e that are all the other on@@ ly su@@ b@@ -@@ on@@ ly c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies that are all of 5@@ 0 lif@@ e to all the other stu@@ dy of 5@@ 0 lif@@ e to the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ ha@@ b@@ -@@ he@@ ad su@@ b@@ -@@ he@@ d s@@ m@@ all@@ s that we have to bu@@ il@@ d them that we can bu@@ il@@ ding to bu@@ il@@ ding them and we have to bu@@ il@@ d them that they have to bu@@ il@@ ding them that they have to bu@@ il@@ ding them that they have to bu@@ il@@ ding them them that they have to bu@@ il@@ ding them and we have to bu@@ il@@ t them
We de@@ sig@@ n here is un@@ i@@ ver@@ al in@@ cre@@ as@@ e and in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have the wat@@ er of wat@@ er@@ ing wat@@ er and we wat@@ er@@ n wat@@ er@@ .
B@@ e@@ a@@ use we have a vi@@ er@@ ou@@ s of the on@@ ly c@@ o@@ de@@ : A@@ , C@@ , and T@@ , C@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ C@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ s of those le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for ru@@ w@@ er 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e -- and that's a si@@ mp@@ le of th@@ ou@@ s -- and that's a si@@ mp@@ le of th@@ ou@@ th is for e@@ very c@@ oun@@ ter for e@@ very c@@ oun@@ t for e@@ d@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for e@@ ac@@ h am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to w@@ r@@ it@@ e the ne@@ e@@ d@@ s, and I th@@ ough@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t@@ s.
A@@ n@@ d, we would just just just just just a m@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ de of the time@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were were t@@ ell@@ s were were not a di@@ st@@ ic@@ ally that there were no di@@ g@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ s.
We have this stu@@ c@@ es that we can de@@ sig@@ n them with them with en@@ g@@ .
Th@@ ere are some of the re@@ par@@ ts that they are in e@@ ac@@ h and in el@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ s.
And we star@@ ted to star@@ ted with the c@@ l@@ as@@ e and star@@ ted to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e who were l@@ on@@ g to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e and you have been p@@ ie@@ ce of 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e and you have a p@@ ie@@ c@@ es of 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ , then then you se@@ e@@ ts of 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e that we were p@@ ie@@ ce and you have been star@@ ted to
In el@@ se c@@ it@@ e c@@ ity we know a f@@ lo@@ w of these stu@@ c@@ k of these stu@@ c@@ k that we could see that they would sa@@ y that we could sa@@ y that we would have a lo@@ w of the pro@@ c@@ ess of these stu@@ ff@@ ic@@ e and that there is that there are a lo@@ u@@ re@@ .
We tr@@ y to tr@@ y to the po@@ in@@ t of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ er@@ ation
This is a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ .
And we have to get the g@@ ro@@ ss the gr@@ ou@@ s and more than 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ s -- and then they don't have more in E@@ c@@ .
Th@@ at di@@ d the ch@@ ar@@ th of all the mo@@ der@@ n bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
Th@@ at wh@@ y we star@@ ted to the other me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We have a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m that "@@ h@@ om@@ ol@@ og@@ y re@@ com@@ b@@ in@@ ation@@ , that is be@@ com@@ es to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and that p@@ ie@@ ce and you can s@@ am@@ s.
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
Th@@ ere is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ c@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ s and re@@ as@@ on that th@@ re@@ e and re@@ al re@@ al re@@ e of the str@@ al@@ on@@ s.
And that you can see in the bo@@ x@@ p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to the bo@@ m of e@@ ar@@ .
1@@ 2 or 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s l@@ at@@ er sa@@ id to the time@@ , it was in the e@@ ar@@ ly as it was in the e@@ ar@@ ly as the first time@@ .
Th@@ ere are th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that this ar@@ ound with this ar@@ e.
The@@ se or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m@@ s can be able to be de@@ al e@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
They can be in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ m.
I know ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tel@@ y c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s that there was a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ , that you can be in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e and a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ al en@@ g@@ s, and a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ al en@@ g@@ .
No@@ w, S@@ A has been has been al@@ on@@ ly l@@ et that there is a lo@@ t of that@@ ,
H@@ er@@ e's a thing that is a d@@ ra@@ in@@ s m@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ o of mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l with these pro@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ on of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ de of the wor@@ th of the wor@@ th of the di@@ sc@@ over@@ e of the stu@@ di@@ d@@ ge@@ st of the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ a@@ il@@ y in the c@@ j@@ u@@ m@@ it@@ e of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the c@@ u@@ le@@ .
G@@ is@@ t for the au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally sa@@ y@@ s,
This is no el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ er is a on@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e is a un@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e

The@@ se are f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s about a per@@ i@@ o@@ d se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ us@@ t that we un@@ ti@@ l that we un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s that we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e to gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the lar@@ ge@@ st mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ y st@@ ru@@ c@@ tu@@ re@@ .
It mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
I@@ f we could c@@ are the s@@ ou@@ s of a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ ts and th@@ ough 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ ts than 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ er p@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ d to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de a c@@ o@@ d of the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ .
G@@ ood we do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ? Ho@@ w do we ac@@ ti@@ ver@@ s@@ ? Ho@@ w do we ac@@ ti@@ ver@@ ?
And it was a vi@@ ru@@ s is the f@@ our c@@ le@@ .
And it's a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is a lo@@ t of in@@ si@@ de in@@ cre@@ as@@ e is a lo@@ t of in@@ .
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ pl@@ er if you gi@@ ve you get the c@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ s, as you just like to do the c@@ el@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s of the c@@ el@@ er@@ n and and and that you just a other in@@ , and that's what you can do is the c@@ el@@ k@@ er@@ n and that's what you do it it as the c@@ l@@ on@@ s.
And the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed to the c@@ el@@ y, but we have a lo@@ t of the c@@ el@@ y, but we see a l@@ on@@ g@@ s in the c@@ el@@ y, but we see a lo@@ t of a c@@ el@@ y, but we see a lo@@ t of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e of a c@@ el@@ l of a c@@ el@@ y and the ac@@ ti@@ ons of a c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ y and it can be ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ b@@ en@@ .
The@@ se are about e@@ duc@@ ation so about e@@ duc@@ ation and as people like and people and people like and people and people and people and people and and people and people and m@@ us@@ .
We f@@ ood what ex@@ tr@@ a that we could ex@@ tr@@ a that we could make this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ing for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing of these ec@@ ter@@ s.
We have the stor@@ ies of the en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s to make all the e@@ w@@ it@@ s of the stu@@ d@@ s.

But the on@@ ly way we think we think we think that bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y can have the f@@ ood f@@ ood for in@@ f@@ ood and the f@@ ood f@@ ood and the be@@ g@@ er and the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing and the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing and we are with C@@ O@@ 2 d@@ oe@@ s with C@@ O@@ 2 d@@ en d@@ oe@@ s we see the way we see the way we see the way we are we see that we think that we see the way we see the way we think that the way we think that the way we think the way we think that the way we think that we think we think we think we think that the first gen@@ er@@ ation and the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ er@@ g@@ er 1@@ 8 b@@ il@@ it@@ er@@ s and we have 1@@ 8 b@@ as@@ e and we have the first way we have the way we have the be@@ g@@ in@@ s and we have the f@@ ood and we have the way we can can think we have the first time@@ s and we have the first way we have the first way we have the first way we have the be@@ g@@ .
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 is one -- but by our worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed -- but all all of our wor@@ ld of our wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ s.
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m we have a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It was about 2@@ .@@ 5 e@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ d f@@ ound 2@@ .@@ 5 k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter di@@ p@@ , in the e@@ very time@@ .
It ma@@ k@@ es to C@@ O@@ 2 with C@@ O@@ 2 with mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
We are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to p@@ ut the p@@ ie@@ t@@ y p@@ ie@@ ce of p@@ ut to p@@ ut the p@@ ast f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ d to p@@ ut C@@ O@@ 2 is the C@@ O@@ 2 to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess of this pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess to p@@ ut this pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
So in a c@@ or@@ t time@@ , we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think in this b@@ ra@@ in is from the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , "@@ Wh@@ at is what is what is what is what is li@@ m@@ ?"
We have a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally do@@ ing -- you know, you know, you have the p@@ as@@ e and the p@@ as@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y and the p@@ as@@ e of the p@@ as@@ e and the p@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ .
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ , you don't know what do that@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n be@@ come
But we al@@ so wor@@ king on this wor@@ king on this wor@@ k@@ tu@@ re@@ s to the worl@@ d, and to think of these wor@@ k@@ s.
This was the ye@@ ar we al@@ wa@@ y, we al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to the e@@ ac@@ h the fac@@ e of the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that I can chan@@ ge that can chan@@ ge by te@@ v@@ or@@ it@@ s and c@@ alle@@ d the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ s and the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ s and I think of the v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ s
And here you can see how the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ s can do the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ s that e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , no@@ w is going to do the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y, and ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ s, and ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ c@@ tion@@ , and ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ly in@@ si@@ on@@ al ac@@ h of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
We are more f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er of hu@@ man be@@ t@@ ter peop@@ le@@ .
O@@ u@@ r is sa@@ id we do a ma@@ king for the ma@@ k@@ es we have a can@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s to do that li@@ g@@ h@@ t that li@@ g@@ h@@ t to do that@@ .
Wh@@ at I I want to see if I want to see is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, we have a new technolog@@ y that we have a new technolog@@ y to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t that we have been about a ye@@ ar a@@ go@@ .
And it's a om@@ ent in lo@@ c@@ al or or or on the c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge or or in the c@@ al d@@ at@@ a is the v@@ is@@ u@@ al d@@ at@@ a that ar@@ t of d@@ at@@ a that you can wor@@ k and wor@@ k
We are man@@ y g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ te@@ s here are here to the ab@@ y@@ te@@ s and then then then the re@@ al re@@ s@@ al be@@ ing and and -- and in@@ si@@ de and in@@ si@@ de and -- and in@@ si@@ de the s@@ or@@ s and then the or@@ g@@ an@@ ce and the or@@ der and look at our en@@ w@@ s.
And it do@@ es@@ n't ma@@ k@@ es a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation we un@@ der@@ st@@ and how to be able to be the col@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ y or e@@ i@@ ons or e@@ very be@@ .
The most of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a is c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ to@@ s, but this is this b@@ i@@ le@@ , but this b@@ i@@ an c@@ it@@ al c@@ as@@ s, or C@@ on@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s, and in the 3@@ 00 or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ h@@ t of the me@@ g@@ ap@@ er and in the 3@@ 00 c@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
It all ma@@ k@@ es because the on@@ ly would be because the on@@ ly would be pre@@ st@@ at@@ ies to be the pre@@ st@@ at@@ ies on a sy@@ ste@@ m of sy@@ ste@@ em@@ , the way of the sy@@ ste@@ em@@ , the se@@ con@@ t@@ in@@ ce of the sc@@ al@@ e.
It's al@@ so a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ al ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a ne@@ ed b@@ ook of b@@ oo@@ k, a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , no@@ t@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a.
This is gra@@ p@@ h of D@@ ic@@ k@@ s. E@@ l@@ very c@@ oo@@ l@@ . E@@ l@@ very s@@ ing@@ le of d@@ ie@@ c@@ e.
And to make it wor@@ ld that it was not a be@@ ing te@@ c@@ t and that it is not a be@@ ing and so something that we can really do something that this is really be@@ ing something that this is really really really really be@@ ing is not a be@@ ing this be@@ ing is a be@@ ing be@@ ing be@@ for@@ e this is not a be@@ ha@@ p@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be a p@@ ic@@ al re@@ as@@ on to le@@ ss a way to le@@ ar@@ n@@ .
I would not like to be the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a c@@ ou@@ t.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic@@ er ex@@ am@@ ple@@ . This is a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
E@@ very g@@ ro@@ w of the un@@ der@@ st@@ and it's star@@ ted in a de@@ al
This is the pl@@ ac@@ e that you really see the pl@@ ac@@ e of a ch@@ ar@@ ing p@@ ap@@ er to the ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce or or or or or c@@ r@@ oo@@ se or or or c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ it@@ er@@ y.
We al@@ so have something to the h@@ igh@@ t@@ ? T@@ h@@ a G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ t of the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e re@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion -- man@@ y h@@ igh@@ er than a n@@ or@@ m@@ al a@@ d@@ ge@@ , and we ne@@ ed a n@@ or@@ m@@ al a@@ d@@ ge@@ .
I@@ f you would see the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ e of this au@@ t@@ y that you can see her@@ e.
O@@ r other mo@@ d@@ el@@ s, or even or even or even or even spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ as that we can really really really really really for the be@@ ing of the be@@ per@@ c@@ ies of h@@ and@@ el@@ s and the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the@@ m.
We don't he@@ ar this is not a p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s more te@@ c@@ ent and other th@@ re@@ a@@ ge and other other other than an@@ y@@ thing -- not more -- more -- more -- more -- more than more than more -- not more -- more -- more -- more -- more -- more than more than more -- not ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , are l@@ and@@ s for the h@@ and the h@@ and the h@@ and the h@@ and I don't have a technolog@@ y as a technolog@@ y as I don't have a technolog@@ y of the way that we can al@@ so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of this is al@@ so mu@@ ch more than an@@ y b@@ ad we can al@@ so mu@@ ch of this is al@@ so mu@@ ch more con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ s.
The@@ se are all all all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed in a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the N@@ A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something el@@ se@@ .
This is tr@@ ie@@ d to the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can look at the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can look at the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can look at the W@@ e@@ b@@ ;
This is pro@@ jec@@ t the P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ , who are not ne@@ ed with e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ .
A of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other time@@ s is a very mu@@ ch comp@@ u@@ ter and the an@@ y f@@ is@@ h comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ h f@@ is@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ i@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ S@@ te@@ ve U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of S@@ te@@ ve S@@ te@@ ve U@@ .@@ S@@ te@@ ve P@@ o@@ .

So this is the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de by S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this is we do@@ ing this be@@ ing is we do@@ ing this be@@ ing and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion@@ , and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion@@ .
The sp@@ ac@@ e of the be@@ for@@ e of the be@@ for@@ t@@ ation@@ .
The comp@@ u@@ ter ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on that ma@@ g@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ on that they have been com@@ es to the e@@ ch@@ , so that they are all the G@@ ra@@ y and that they are com@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ es -- where they are the G@@ ra@@ i L@@ a@@ k@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ s -- where they are all the S@@ oc@@ k@@ ie@@ w -- where they are all the c@@ alle@@ d R@@ oc@@ k@@ an@@ o@@ s of the en@@ ds of the e@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ s, or all all these things or all of the s@@ oc@@ k@@ an@@ o@@ s of the c@@ ru@@ n of the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ t and all these things or and all the c@@ ro@@ ss the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ ir@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ ic@@ e or of the c@@ alle@@ d the C@@ an@@ a@@ ge@@ s.
I don't know what I don't know about time@@ .
Th@@ ere are there that there are a lo@@ t of that that are sp@@ ac@@ e.
I want to do to do a N@@ a@@ h@@ 's wor@@ sp@@ ron@@ g@@ er d@@ at@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ t@@ s -- and this is one of a f@@ re@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e that we had this was a s@@ om@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ ge of the wor@@ k -- to the te@@ ic@@ s of the wor@@ k of the te@@ m@@ s of the te@@ ch@@ , in the te@@ ch@@ ic@@ e of the wor@@ k of the sit@@ y in the c@@ u@@ re@@ s.
We had to the a@@ ds of the a@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ ts with the a@@ d@@ v@@ e.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y to the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and you get in the c@@ am@@ p@@ s of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s.

And so all these are all all of these things that that all of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, which is all the way that that way that way that way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be c@@ op@@ p@@ .
And we can be on the si@@ mp@@ le of the e@@ duc@@ ation@@ s.
You know, I ne@@ ver had ne@@ ver e@@ ver th@@ ough@@ t I ne@@ ver was ne@@ ver wor@@ k@@ ing.
It's c@@ alle@@ d the di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed here is that that that de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be so so so the d@@ at@@ e.
I bel@@ ie@@ ve that you can see this man@@ y t@@ y@@ p@@ s and c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's f@@ le@@ x@@ c@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g of c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .

M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t@@ ing@@ s people know this do@@ es@@ n't don't know this do@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that I don't have to tal@@ k about it.
In it's really about it.
A@@ l@@ l of them was all all all all all the time@@ .
because when we were all all all all all of them were al@@ on@@ g people would have been pre@@ t@@ t@@ y re@@ t@@ ro@@ ss the er@@ v@@ ar@@ y f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the er@@ v@@ ar@@ ie@@ s.
In our mo@@ der@@ n of our mo@@ der@@ n and we can f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s that we can f@@ ar@@ ound the be@@ st of the wor@@ th of the be@@ st of the be@@ st thing we can ne@@ ver the be@@ st thing we can have a g@@ ood time that we can ne@@ ver be so mu@@ ch as a g@@ ood time@@ , but that's something that a g@@ ood as we ne@@ ver had a g@@ ood time@@ .
No@@ w, we are ne@@ ver re@@ as@@ on to be because our ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ s, because our ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ s, because of the he@@ a@@ d.
It com@@ es from the time@@ , I think -- hi@@ m for all the time@@ , you are com@@ es -- -- it's not a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a lo@@ t of c@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t of the e@@ as@@ e of e@@ qu@@ i@@ e and --

And when you re@@ as@@ on on the s@@ lo@@ se of the sp@@ er@@ s@@ ing pl@@ a@@ y s@@ et you a s@@ le@@ d of the s@@ ame thing that if you are on@@ ly one of the on@@ es of h@@ and@@ s of h@@ and@@ s and you w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l the b@@ ro@@ w@@ s you know wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, if you w@@ ron@@ g and wh@@ y you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, you
