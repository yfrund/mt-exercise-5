And I show you this two dia's last year to show that the police cap, who the last three million years, which the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent croms of the U.S. with 40 percent croms.
But this is actually the real problem because it is the worst of this specific problem because it doesn't the ice of the ice of ice ice.
The ice cape on the North Pole, in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crach in the summer.
The next dia I show is a version is a certain version of what happened the last 25 years is happened.
The permanent ice is shaped in room.
As you see, you know, set it out from darker blue.
That's the year, that's the early during the winter.
And it crack in the summes.
And the called permanent ice, five or ance, five years or older, which is almost like blood, that from the body's skype here.
In 25 years is the from this go.
And that's a problem because the frors around the North IJssea North IJssea very big amount of fairly cup, and there's a very great amount of death, when it was designed by microbe, when it gets designed by microbe.
And with the total resources to the total reinvention in the atmosphere, that would be clear, that would be double if we can describe if we can describe writing the crite of the crite of the atmosphere.
In some understand in Alaska borrels in Alaska borrely of the water.
And Afrgely Walter Katey Walter of the University of University of Alaska different team to another unep of the University of the University
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be
A reason for that, is that this huge warming warming warming of the north of the north of the north of the north of the normous warming.
This is a smell developing smell of this is a smell develop.
The water completely is real fairer than ever great.
This is the Kangerlussuage in South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea cape because it is the country to be the place where it is the place comes in the sea of where it comes in the sea come.
These stromations are flightly flightly
On the other side of the planet, on the South police, the largest ice mass the largest ice mass the most ice mass of the planet.
And Afried months scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice continent now
More specific is the ice of the South pool of the South police of South pool patterns with some of the islands.
The whole continent is the continent of six meter, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massay, there are new now, who were a few years ago, who were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the half of his drags of the global time.
In the Andes, this glater is this glass the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are more streams.
But when they disappearing to the droppears it trip.
In California was a further from 40 percent in the snow pack of the Sierra.
It's in the water resources in the water ress.
And as you could, the predictions are the predictions of it.
This world's ream dream to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of natural around the world is cited with an incredible and never securrence.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely invitable.
If you look at a historic context put out of a historic context what happened.
In the last five years we've got 70 million ton on CO2 --
25 miles every day in our oceans, looked at the eystical area of Stille Ocean, from America, from America, west, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drager continent, there's a drags in the ocean.
The only big causing of the Earth, next to deal fix, which is the burning of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the most most most of the most most most problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extinue with China.
And there was a pretty more cool central.
But we see a clase of it.
These are the citing centrals, which the building was annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last year.
There's a political stated on the close of our country.
The cities of oil, and oil-industing year, 250 million dollars to promotly from "scale to promotly a currence, which is a course.
And that picture to something like this.
And Rond the charge was at home in Tennesse, about four billion liter closed to believe in the cure of money
You know, probably in the news of the news of the news.
This is the one after the greatest depicture in America.
This is happened to the Kerst.
One of the advertised the cool leftly drop around the Kerst was this one.
Video: "Frosty the coolman is a black church.
He is overflow here in America, and he put it in America, and he put it into the economic.
Frosty the cutty coolman is with the day scared with the day
He is paid and cutty and cup."
Here's a big part of the citied of the cool in West Virginia from the cool in West Virginia of the course.
The greatest best mine the land is the great base of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanckship -- "Let me clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about they're talking about that."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate protection two campaign.
This is a piece of it.
Video "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our things to our things for our things

So, you don't make a care certain climate change.
Let me sure that but we go.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern citypermodern central.
Fantastic machines make the machines make a lot of law.
But that's the sound of sound of ship,
And despite the fact that the fact that the free of the cities, one of the most important war of the Earth is change the remarkable of the Earth city, the remarkable of technology that you see all of this is what you see here.
Look well, this is the scene of the cool technology of today.
Al Gore: Eintually put the positive alternative alternative alternative to our economic security of national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong, the economic, the economy, the climate crisis.
The red wire of these things are all of these things is our dependence of fossil fuels, like fiels and inmported oil,
But now there is a durful, new solution to get to real this.
Fore America 100 percent scale electricity, in 10 years.
A plan America is to get America work to work on the work of us and the opwarming of the Earth of the Earth catter.
Einally an solution that are currently enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ont-decise.
Al Gore: And the last one.

One of the fastest ways to make a end of old to our dependence of old failed to do the planet to help seeing our planet to help seeing to help seeing seeing a planet to help seeing a lot of the planet to help seeing a long ways to do a long ways to our planet to help a last fast.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: New w is to create good investmental jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking that says, "If you want to be a soon all of it.
If you want to go to far air."
We need to go far and far and so.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I really, to get back with a hypdate about how that machine works.
So here I am them. For those who didn't have the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever summiment in the engineer.
It need to the circumstances that were less than a billion a billion of a billion to 600 million times a second of 600 million times per second.
And the norm ambition!
This is the machine under Genern.
We took photographs of those mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. And this is the ATLAStor detector -- 44 meters the ATLAStor detector 22 feters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS, so you can see the scale so you can see the scale of the scale so you can see the scale so you can see the scale of the scale.
And in 10 september of the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That was a party to a party party in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all the LHC went around the LHC garound the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that photograph on 10 September knew that the machine working, which is a huge win.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest right, or then, when somebody went to Google and saw the Internet pagina way.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with this golden with these golds of golds of the golden of the golds of the golden of the machine, which had to do with this gollater we had a problem with the machine,
And they took 13 thousand thousand amper resources when the machine on volving the power.
The engineers are to say, "Do you know, "Not whale. It's totally small of the tiny of the tiny of it.
They can do that because they are superperature are superature on whole low-temperaturs.
So in 271 graded the space between the space between the gars, that can drags that reason that stream read and
In one of the construction between the necks thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And that was the wire was something warmer, and there was increating electrical weather thousand ample of amper resources that 13 thousand amper resources that was the wirelectrical against of the wire of the wire of the wire of that was the wire of the wire of the wire of the wirelectrical resources that was the wirelectrical real.
This was the results of the results.
This is still indrow if you realized you realized that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeters they were going to put 30 centimeter.
We decidents.
We had to get them from it, what we did them.
We all have the tool.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather intact.
We will go to the refrights and expect measure to measure to be able to go with the expect of the universe, so that we can build to the build of the universe.
Now, of course, who have increated the debate of science, the value of scientific research. It's easy to continue to confitive to continue
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be that we go to further than ever go from the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, did the device of the value of the value of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his before to take for the human minds, and that we are not needs to take the being of the human being being of the beysteries are not going to be in natural and that we discovered to be able to be able to be able to be able to be not leavel that we discoverever definite that our being definite our before that our before that we are not faviefaviefaviefive five five five faviefaire our bebebefore of ite of ite of ite definite our before our before our be
Thank you very much!
I would want to start to ask with you to ask to your kids at your kiddle childhood at the block.
When you discovered to understand how you had to go to the coppic, and recently, you know, you actually solve the learning of space relationships with the depenters of space relationships.
Ruphrasician insight is because the understand using us to understand using us.
If a information of inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advisual Pattion and my advisual course of Kalanithi -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we would use a computer to informer a kind of finger defishing to a lot of informing fingence that information with a place of fingers that we can figurrative with a lot of information with information with a fy soccure.
and can make orders like we want to get it?
This question to see us so that we decided to look for a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Some is a Siftly a Sift a interactive computer sion of a cooks.
They can be with the hand to the hand they can put them to each other, their movement and they came up a screen and wirely contact.
The nuclear understanding the physical handled like block to understand they're going to be placed to understand
Bovenue are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the way, of digital information.
Day these resource are a more physical different ent various movement and even from their movement and even from the way we can move them from each other and even explore them, there are different new and fun interactions are going to me.
I'll start with some simple simple example.
This Sift is insted to show to show to show to tell a video games, and otherthere's other-other-other-other-other-other-other-other-other-other-opens and otherther.
These interactive portraits are consciously consciousness.
Indience to each other, they will be place to each other for each other other other interests.
And if they were curring this and they can also be able to be what are becoming to be able to be able to be the certain currently
And they feel movement and they movement.
We realized algave that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interaction, the use of all of the interaction of the interaction of a small of a small of a small of a small of a sliquid of a sligh.
In this example of the example Siftables of the core and I can use them to use color in a leg to go and where they were intended to get them to become in.
If we gotten reason, we go back to what back.
There are some clear cumber to the education, and logically playing with language, mathematics and logically logically where we want to give people the possible of things to probers, and the result of the result of the result of the result medical to see the result of the education.
And here's this -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci result of a simple programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmatic programmatic programmation.
Here's a game that a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in any of every single letter around the same letter of Siftable, and feeling controlled in a words,
And after about 30 seconds it is a new series of condition and different a new series of series with bits of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm slowed it out of the Media Lab, and I have a video of this.
They were really really,
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people almost not almost of instructions that people need to have instructions
Everything you need to say, "Make word" and they know what to do is do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our younger benefits the trial.
Because he just the Siftables wish the Siftables
For him were just bloces.
Here's an interactive painting a interactive.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of developing language.
This is Felix that demonster demonst.
He can new characters in the scene of the course, by the Sift with that character of the table.
He show you the sun coming the sun coming the sun coming out the sun coming the sun coming the sun coming out the sun coming the sun coming up the sun
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done th! Yeah!
By the shape of Siftables and the next to each other, he can response the carager -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Helell
DM: It's a story with a story with a open ended on a open end.
and he decided how it walk to the decision.
Video: The catch fly airly away away.
DM: The last example I will show you a synthesizer Is a synthesizer and live music to developed to developed where every Siftables like the lead, base like the lead, base and drop of drugs and drow.
One has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
And this happy to be injected in Siftables are injected to be injected to be the pattern.
You place a sound sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leg Sift of a leger Sifects of a fects like reasonable of reasonable and filter.
They are to be a sound and sound and sounded to can.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are patterns on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead place in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a extra lot of extra lead.
Now I place the base line of the base line of the base line
Video: Now I feel what sleeping slagulating what slaghtly work.
Video: And now I couple the filter on the drum of the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: I can cell it through the obvious of the tempo block of the tempo block.
Video: Now I couple the filter to the filter for what expression.
Video: I can repeating the pattern of the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have anything to plan, but I can improvise to improvise and shorter very longer and shorter like I want.
With the dimms of the continue Siftly by the obviously.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, my passion of new people, which are better interfaces that are better interfacing on the way our brain and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designs with some designs with some of designs that we are developing to develop the developing of the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is only the courage of course, to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world as we wanted to get it.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you all with you and talk to you to talk to you to get to you all and you go to to you all with you.
I'm writing it.
Booking writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am all of writing and I don't think that ever will change that it will change it.
And yet there is unless the way to be happened in my life and career, which I had to go to my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and
And it started a book that I did understanding on a book "Ets, Biinnen," Bembarrain, Bembary that very work about my first world and a international world and an international stated.
The consequence is that people are always to be always to be always as as as as as as as I was dam.
Well, what -- really, what -- gottty!
People come to me and ask to me and ask you and ask you and ask this success is never equal?
You don't think you can read your whole life is going to be making the left of the book is going to be a book publish where people are going to lopen?
And you don't get there?"
Ery hundred you know.
Of course, that would be very curle. But I remember 20 years ago, I was a teener -- I was told that I wanted to be a teenam I wanted to be a teenath.
People said, "Ben you don't get that you never get success?
Don't you get to real, that you rese, you know, rese?
You don't bang you live to this work on this work without of this without of the broads and that you will be able to be able to dreams of your broken dreams with your bittered bitterns of fail?"
Some in that stretch.
And in the shortly comes to this question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are called
Always the ways of it.
But I'm also many other things that is a lot of other things that we all know for all of it.
For sea seam for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that few feel that feet to be angling few to the last from.
Is it rational?
Is it ways to be a lot of that anybody is took to work for the work for work for the work of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the work of the Earth are they put to their opportunat?
What is that reason to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the mindness of the mind of the work of work work on the work of work is not going to happened to be a kind of work on the effects of creative processing to the effects of creative processing to creative proc
And you take my father. He was skypical engineer, and I cannot remember that there was a 40 years, who he didn't remember any for it.
And so you know, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so was not about it.
And to be fair fair engineers have been through the centuries have not the reputation of the reputation of manicalcoholists.
Sup, who did have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human instability to be instaboul instable.
Look at the grimmic deathrough the most magnificans of the most magnificans of the 20th century.
Many stiated young, often by own own through own own through own to continue
And even the concerning of self that are not suicide to be concerned to be concern.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meiler of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty what to say about your life work.
But from this kind of spoke to look at this kind of looking at the time.
We all heard it with before and have it with the sources with the sky.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity to connected to lick up and that a artist, and that a artist, to recently lead to cally.
And so I want to ask everybody here today to ask that idea of life that idea of lif?
Do you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think about the all the way I think about the all of the emalmost already thought to it.
I think it's the reason the real reason
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century this century is that this century.
We can creative mind much better increative mind to life.
I know that it was to me, in my situation, in my situation, for me, to be dangerous to that dark to that dark to that dark to that dark to that dark to that dark to that dark to that it for me.
Seker the fase where my careers now in which my career.
Go one, but after young, am per faile.
I can maybe I can work four decade.
Home probably will be what I still now is going to be seen as the world as the world as the world that following out of the outside of the extraordinary successful book.
We're using with friends with each other, so I can slow you go to the bigh my greatest success of my greatest success of behind me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you go to think, you're going to be the morning to take the morning to take hours to take the drank.
So I don't want to reme.
I love me love to the work that I loved with the work where I love to the work of the work I love with the work where I love with the work of where I love to do with the work where I love me with the work of the work of the work that I love to the work of the work of where I love with the work of love.
And the question is: "Hoo?"
And after long after long the conclusion that I can only go with writing a psychological screen in the process of inbuild in the process of inbuild inbuild in the process of inbuild in the process of inbuild in the process of the conclusion as I build a psychological scription that I can build
I have to create a safe of create distance between me, and my government between me and my government to the reactions for the reactions of the reactions on my futures.
I have the last year for ways to ways that ways to way.
I'm in the history and have a deploy-cutes, and have a better societies to see or anothers to see a better way to help creative people to get to help creative people to get to deal with emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been based me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let because it's a long and inplicated.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romeins and believe that creativity was not to be creativity of themselves.
And they believe that creativity was a good particular spirit was a reason, incular place to human came to human reasons.
The Great named these next are these tremendous of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demp words of influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they called a called a called creative spirit was a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, and a courage of clear.
In their policy was a genius, a kind of magins that are purposed in the cure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work was the genius,
And he shape of the work.
Brillight! That's prectory the wrong of the first time I talked about the psychological protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is work.
The artist, in the artist, in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you work out there, you know, you came there, you know, you couldn't all the egg.
Everybody knew that was a invisible genius,
You know, you know, the work way, then that doesn't just take any any one of you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty unused to have a pretty called a pretty called a pretty of understanding of the real genius.
Long time is that the Westen creativity was creativity to be creativity to considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change the Renaissance,
There is a whole new idea: the individual human is the individual human universe, and state all the gods and mysterions.
Gone space for mystical creatures, attacked from the goddnessed world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believe that creativity was completely from the individual came to the individual.
And for the first time, in the history was about artists of artists that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I need to say that I have to say that a great ful.
And in one person, one person, one person, one of individual individual to believe that he or she or the cron of the century of the century of the century mystery of everything good does and the couple of the equal human psyched, and the cure human psyche.
And, if you ask anybody ask in the click.
Egos to go blows to gigantic proportions and there are incredibly expectations of prestations to prestate prestations.
And I think this drags the last 500 years a lot of artists has made a lot of artists.
And if that is that that so is the question, and I think "What now?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back on a older the relationship between the relationship between the human beings and creative mysterion?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years rational humanism not uncease in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the same played of a 18 minutes
And probably in the audience of people who have realized scientific developing the idea that either have fairly scientists with what feedits with what feedits to inspirating high-tes to inspirating high-teaching high-tempts.
It doesn't look at me that I will get you all to get you to get you.
And I ask it me to me.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought that I thought to next it?
It's just like much as much as much as all the other explained unculating unculating incomputnity that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, we don't know that the creative process is not always the creative process to be a creatic process to be rational real.
That sometimes almost paranormally attacks.
I have the great American diglobal American diglobal Ruth Stone Stone Stone of Ruth Stone of the amazing American disuspected to me.
She's close in the next. Her whole life all writing them all the life of them.
She told me about her right on the platatteland of Virginia.
Sometime, if she was felt on the work of work she was a close to the close of the country.
It was, so said so, there is a big golf air, if you came air.
Some close to go to the country to her the country to it.
She felt that the ground, under her fairly started to shape that her on that her on that her lived to do that, rening for her life.
And they right out home, back by the close and she had to see so fast and packly showing and paper to see packing.
When it was close to her her her was waved to writer only chance to write it on the writing to write it.
Sometimes she didn't fast.
Then ring and right now, but it's not currently not.
And the moments the close of close is close to her the field, on the fired -- in her words -- in her words -- to another directly -- to another directly
And also we find the best of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are almost mistake.
And then she was in home on and paper and paper and paper it by her it.
Juist on that moment she had a potoment they had a potom.
And with her other hand, so told me she poemit from the air.
And she picked up with his stard, and put it back in her body, and while them, while they're written the written written the again.
In that cases came the close of course, but then in the close of paper but then in the case of paper --
When I thought that heard, I thought, I thought my creative process of creative process of creative process
So my creative process is not a medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mushing mushing on the same time, who are the same time, and sweating with blood, and trans and trans explore and trans exploration.
But even in that day looked at that day I have a experience.
You also know it will also felt that are creative ideas in your borrely of ideas in your bron in your bron from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that break for sourc?
How can we use the use without that we are being the way that we are being the way to be using without that we are become a without of the real without that we are become the continue without that we are become a certain the way.
On a way that are good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the reason this this.
And in fact, a big part of his life is a great part of his life is the showed of the amazing artist, which is trying to get to get to the uncontinue to get the incontinue of the incontinue of the uncontrol.
With the 1990s was the back of the back of the back of the back.
And I think I was in Los Angeles Angeles over the speed of radical radical reason.
And while he read this is so really, he heard a fragments.
The decided like inspiration that is inspiration that is does understand crazy cellent.
It was a beautiful eyed and he wanted to clear,
But that way,
He didn't have a paper piece, no taperecorder to see it.
The amazing example, and then the called "I went from the melody and then makes me it to be the melody of the century and then it turns me to sheads to be the century of the melody back
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't real real real human being in panic, but he stop the whole process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and said, "Sorry heard you heard the sky of the wall?"
"Do you really know that I can crowd a song of song here?
If you really want to get this lod, you need to be later if I have to do time for you.
Now, you know, someone else is going to fall.
Ga neighborned Cohen." And from that she walked that moment to be very different different different from the process of the process of the process of the process
The work itself is the same dark with the dark of dark suber understanding of the dark of the dark of itself is the same dark of the same dark itself is the same dark itself is the same thing.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him reflected to the close of the genius.
It was to close to close and skin the skin and read it just to the skin and close to the skin and skin the skin and read it all the skin and close to close it and close.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through it.
It could, a wonderful clabor, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diase and own the own of Tom and own the own diaspect that was not going to be able to put ourselves.
That story that has changed my way of work changed.
I had a real real regular of getting from the securrently of the time.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biinn.
And I think it's a case moment in sphere.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you don't want to be good and you think it's a difference. And it's a difference. It was bad. It's bad.
Not simply bad of the bad bad bad.
I wanted to do it all the project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project to all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project to all the whole pro
And then I remember Tom those who was course, and I decided to be a power to way.
I wish me from my manuscriting and rips me to a leave to a leave of the room of the room
And I said, "Listere, "Listen we know all know that if this book is not just brilliant book is that if this book, it's not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have.
More can't give it.
If you find that it should be better than you can do that.
Stape you don't know that, right? That's right.
I just write through because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the not."
Tjaja--- Uited it comes on the right --
Euwing ago, there was in the North African African desert people to dance to dance with monlight to dance in the North African
And then they were and hours, to the object to the morning glor.
That was always great, because the dances were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very happened to be something happened to be something happened to be a little bit of something happened to be a little bit of something happened to be a little bit of something happened to be a little bit of something happened to be a little bit of separates.
One of that dances than transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean to mean that I mean you mean to be a performer.
It was like the time still still and the dance of the dance stape of a poor.
He didn't anything else, but now anything else to be failed to be.
And he didn't read a human being ond only a human being.
In him, under him, under him glor.
A good fired fired him.
And if it was something happened to be able to get people to class and clase to clase and in crack and currently, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
Because that was the for them.
By the way, a ful historical fact the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Span.
The explain is real real awing "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, Ole other."
That hear you today the day of the day and fights and flamengodances.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible, "Allah, OK, okay, oil, "Allah, OK, oalone, well, brain."
One seam is a glim of God.
Pristy what we need to need.
Lastill is real that the dance of the next morning to discovered that he discovered to drags 11 hours at the morning laws doesn't have a good dardn't have a good dardenly chair.
And in that moment is a little bit of the parenty with depents that made may be more to such more to such more to such more to such more to be to be to such more to be to be a little bit of again.
Maybe there will never anyone God anyone God attacks.
What to be that with the rest of his life?
That's hard to that.
That's really hard to real frice for a creative mine a creative mind.
But so need to be to be to be the point.
And if you don't think you will already that the most intraining aspects of your person from yourself.
And imagine you believe that you have a time to be a while of a didn't take a touch of source.
When you ready ready member, they are given to someone else.
And so so, you know, can't catts.
I handing infull that though.
The last months I've been working on a book that book that book a lot of reach reason that many of reikhalf to reach reikhalf to reach and reikhalf to is looking at is
The real representation.
And if my thought with me the hold me to hold me I still the same thing -- and they don't have the same way.
That's just the work.
And just just your doing, what it is.
If you go to dance, thance, thance.
And if it reason that you is to decided is to decision to work on the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources, "Ol!"
Geat is not through through that, but thank you very much but through it.
And also then, "Oll!
I believe that heart.
"Ol!" how it because we put out of pure human loved and own wisdom and own wisdom and own and own wisdom and own and own wisdom and own and own wisdo."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had the really, I did it all a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean of new sets and what that can mean, and the discovered of new sets of new sets of sets of new sets of new sets of genes.
We started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digital code of the digital code of that digital code to a new fase of that digital code to design from life in biology to design thetic and synthetic designing and synthetic design.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living a little bit of biologists have trying to understand to understand to understand to understand
We have a different benefits to leaders to minimutes to minimual components.
We're now almost 20 years to the digitalization.
When we have the human genome ced, went to the crath world of the analog world of the biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask sure to ask life regenerate, or we can create new life of this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the small, with the maps of a laboratory-fiel.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can get a nice smaller genome.
We can go in the order of hundred generating from the 500 or whole, which are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, which is relatively relatively with the in.
Gell me, this is simplication.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can look at the onlived is a living cell cell cell that this would be a living cell cell cell cell of the cell of the generator.
We decided that the only route pretty was to take this chromosly to synthetic so that we could get the components to be so that we could couple the components to ask the next of the most fundamental questions.
And so we are asking with questions, "Can we started a chromos?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry that we never seen before we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosal, "Well,
A chromosly is a piece of chemical iners and a piece of chemical material.
So, our tempo of the digital issue of life is exponential while is exponential wood.
Our power to writing the genetic code to writing the genetic code of slowly slowly slowly slowly to the genetic code
And our last point would be the past point to place on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethic tshape of the first experiments.
But it turns out that synthesis is really hard to be hard to be
There are 10 of powers of machines in the world who make little pieces DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in lengination, so much longer you make it more fair, so much more foliters.
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the fairts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Exx.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the pieces of the foll.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we started a piece of chemical stopts, and the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria courage code the genetic code and viral particles and viral particles
The viral particles were from the cells, they were caps, they came out of the cells, they came back and death,
I was increating in the oil, and I said that they said that model that model just said that they were to good snaps.
They read over you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a situation in a biological system in a biological system
But we wanted to do something much bigger --
We wanted to build the completely chromosal.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassettty case of virus, so that we could put the case of virus, so that we could put the case of various ...
to go to understand what the deeply components of a living cell cell cell
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information to be very accurazy accurazy accuraght to be very accuraghtly with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital in
When we first first of this genome of the first times in 1995 was the standard precision is a 10,000 per 10,000 baseparates.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 folats. If we had the original sequence of used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start
And the design of the design is the designs that are 50 letters that are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build out of 50 lettters to build designs that we need to design to design so that they can design to design so that they can design to design to design the design of the designs that they can design to design the
We designs of the unique of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the designs of the design.
Maybe you read reading that we have water water right now we have water in stop.
Beause this: we have a cell genetic code: A, C, God and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for right now 20 aminozers -- that there is a only attack for every aminozue for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to writing words to writing the genetic code of thought.
And then we only called "The called a me.
Some were told that there were no closed that there were no closed to it.
We have this pieces that we can design them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they reparticipate and in each other and they reput them in each other
And we started to make pieces that five to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters that were long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 724,000 letter, to 7200.
In every citched to cweek a conflict of these pieces so that we could sequences because we can create a process that is very robuy robuy that will be currencouly.
We try to reach the point of automatising the point of automatising.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we get to the big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparats -- then they don't grow to easy more in E.
That is the expect of all modern tools of molecular biology biology biology biology.
And so we went to be reason to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolod recombination, that is used by the biology to reparticular DNA to repart that pieces can feet.
Here's a picture of it.
There's a organism called Deinocococused Deinococusing that three million rad to straling to the straling to the same to be to shape of the same called Deinococus to can.
And that you see in the top panel, soon as a chromosope crite of each other.
12 obs 24 hours later he was the weather in each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms that are
These organisms can completely ream ream ream
They can life in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can be life in space that can be existing to space that can be proposed to be a new aquatical environment.
NASA has married show that there is a lot of of it, there's a lot of the way.
Here's a deal microphere, is a microphere, we made with this processing with this processes -- fact with this processes with the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design where we did them in the right design of the molecule of the molecule of the molec
Gist makes that they automatically said they automatic.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph; this is a non-microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see with a light microscope that we can see it with a light molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publish that we were outside.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of molecule structure.
The molecules alone.
If we would present the crite with a 10-points letter, without 142 pages of pagina courage code away to pressure.
Good, how do we started a chromos? How do we started to it?
With a virus is the clear power,
With a bacterion is a lot of intricks.
It's also simpler if you can put under the cell of euke, like whether you walk the cell cell and doing a different in, and that's what you know if it clone.
And in the bacteria of chromosal, in the cell integrated in the cell of the cell transplant transplant to a complete transplant to a chromosal.
We have a chromosly supposed of a microbing kind of a microbs.
These are about each other as much of people and mouse as people and mously mouse.
We figure out what extra genes so that we could make this chromosly coul.
We have the represented with enzyms to make all the egs of the egs of the egs.
It was fresing this in the cell stopped this in the cell stopped graphic imagine the very avanced graphical imagine -- the new chromosly in the cel.
We even thought he was just to develop the process of the process of what further to develop the process of developing what further to develop the process of developing to develop the process of what we were trying to develop the process of the process of what was going to be able to develop the process to develop the process of the process of developing that it would be able to developing to develop the process of developing of the process to developing thought that he would be able to developing would be able to developing to developing to devel
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of second that have a second chromosly cooms or a third of thousands of own own own in one times of the kind of property of own species.
People who are evolution evolution to be a lot of biology has not much biology to be a lot of biology to be a lot of biology who are not much biology who are evolution to be evolution to be a lot of biology to be evolution to propossible evolution to proposed to be a lot of biology that evolution evolution to be a lot of biology as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms who are real, DNA resh real restriction.
The chromosly that in the cell was there there.
The cell -- the chromosly that we stop -- well, what's in the room.
It was pression, and the real chromosed the other chromosal, and why we had the open and why we had to go up and why we had the cell with the new chromosle.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in the generate.
And in a very short time away, all the caraker of the one species of the one species, and changed the new species of species, and software that we had in the cell of the new software that we celed.
All the way, the membrans changed -- when we change the genetic code the genetic code was the precise that was changed.
This is a massive alchemistry, but we are in state, but we are in the state, by change of the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things
Good, I have all before this is not a short of the crath -- this is a bord-evillion years and I have a deal evolution, and I have a new version of the Cambrace that we maybe need to newly a new kind of the Cambrace of the Cambrace of the major scale, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's clearly if you look at what you look at what it is.
We're going to get in, from six-half to go to 99 billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context to place in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for every of us who are in 1946; within 46; in 40 years.
We have to have to be with fairth, with the corniture, with the six, fired for the six-on-half billion of the six-half billion of water,
That's really, that is reason to do that.
We use five billion class, more than 30 billion fire.
That's 100 milos per day.
When we take biological processing or whether to dealing that out, or maybe that a huge challenge challenge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge of biological processes.
Then of course, of course, which is that carbon dioxide of the atmosphere in the atmosphere
And though our world's discovered to have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see that would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had a dozero had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that are from there.
We are concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have technique she speed to be sotly synthesize called "combinations to do called combination.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put on the destrops of 20 million different genes or trying to optimalizing octanial octanial or medicine to produce or medicine to produce a little bit more molecule, we can do with a little bit more molecule, we can do with a science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life vatable to chemical or fattaccinproduction, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen designing what real designing design, so you can really go on the corporation and a new kind of the computer of the computer can design a new species of design.
We don't know how it will see how it out there.
We know how their genetic code out of genetic code out of genetic code
We now fourth now on fourth generations.
One of you have seen to ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will be coming from the inside of the next or more higher fuels like sugar, to more fuels like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food, without the food, and the available price and the available of the available of the food, and why we can design with CO2 as his food, and we think we are couraged to design, and we think we think that the first generation of fixed generation 18 months to have been fired to have fired to have fired fixed to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to read to have to read and maginfiree magine monthy firee magaround the designerencelling fult f
Sidenlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovered to have all sorts of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea five pounds, at about 2.5 miles deep, cooking clock to temperature
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy source.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take called CO2 to fabrice to fabried to fabrice, where that CO2 is becoming back to fuel this process to bring process to fired this process to stop.
So in a shortly time we think we are in the corners we are in the core of basically asking on the basic question: "What's life?"
We have real, knowing the cited of the course, the petrochemical industry to replace to replace.
You don't do this at TED can't do this at TED can do that?
A important energy source is become
But we also work now is to use these works, to think about these works,
This year was the flu was the flying one of the facts like the feits of the right now as the power vaccin.
I think that can change that change to make the shape of temporary vaccine.
Here's how the future of the future, you can see the evolution boom now is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eukaryota.
We are still away from the improved of people.
Our goal is to assure, that we can make a chance to survive long enough to survive that well.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundamentation of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are going to be a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment that you can get to the immense with immense amounts of visual data can work with visual data to work with immense figure out of the way you can work with immense or immense to work with immense or to the immense of visual data to work with immense figure out of immense in which you can work with im
We look at this is a lot of gigabytes and can be clearing in digital images and outsive the way to our wish and the sort of terribs and the sort of terrible and the sort of terribs and the sort of course.
And it doesn't matter from how many information we look at this collections or images are these collections or images.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a shot of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapium of the gapium of the gapixel.
It all nothing that would be because it was the only thing would be the prestations of the prestations of the prestations of the screamed pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of not-image picture of not-image book,
This is a graue of Dicks. Every collect is a heake.
And to evidence that it's really texting, and not picture, we can do something that this really text to show this really text is not imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit of a little bit of a e-book.
I wouldn't read it to it.
This is a realistic, this is a example. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every great imagine is the beginning of a particular part.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper age paper or capacross write or capacross medium.
We also done with the core of these Guardian.
We have a take advertising from higher resolution -- many higher than a normal advertise information -- and we extra extra information information information in.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really do that concerned the limits of handles of the screen through the screen of the screen.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more means and other through the other thing -- not need to be more now.
Of course, of course, a for the hand to the capable to put a technology like this, I will not spending to this field, except that we can have a lot of behave,
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
and picked on a picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is married now on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This is called Photosynthess: two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of the world's vision of Noah Snah Snavely, so on the University of Washington, and showing Seitz University of Seitz U.W.
And Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragond by Seadragonon.
When we do this, we see this is that we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer, vision algorithms of these images are breaded with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades of stabilized diase of stabilized diase of stabila panorama panorama of panorama panorama little bit of aded fish space of the panorama or panorama fults, and all of the computer, and they have been breaded to be breade
I don't know sure or surround, other environments.
There are many space that are many space there.
I want to like to be a Noah's Stones sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynthespe of Photosynth that we were working -- to the communicate what I was in my head, in my head, in my heads of these techniques in the website of the website of the website of the website of the website of the environments,
We had to real realized to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, with imagins with imagins from Flickr. Noe Day's just going to be able to Flickr, and you get imagins of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the imagins of people in Flickr.
And every of these orange chairly picture, which is a imagine of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of the every ither of the orange of the orange of this orange of orange that are part of this orange to be a picture.
So this are all Flickr pimaginations, which are the way to this way.
And we can take on simple to be avigated.
You know, I never thought I had to work at Microsoft would work at Microsoft to Microsoft to work at Microsoft of that.
It's conversion here is to be so replace to be so replace this is to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so to be the considered to be so much to be so much to be so much to design this is to design so to be the making of the connect to design this to be replayed to design this to be real.
I believe you that this many types are cameras, all of gling cameras, a big number of global cameras, a big number of this,
I'll try to find what strange images.
There are so many defined by face and through it.
Erywhere you think about this is a series of photos -- here are there.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daame also that is also good chained by the program.
If we put the poster in a physically picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do really do things with the social environment. This uses the data of the whole collective memory of the whole collective memory -- and carrying out of the seeing -- and carrying out of the power -- and carry that all the time.
All these pictures are with each other and shape a very bigger than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the earth of the Earth of the entire Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth is the entire Earth is the entire Earth of the whole Earth of whole Earth is a model that from the whole Earth is a model that from the whole Earth is the entire Earth to the arth of the arth of the entire Earth is the entire Earth of the entire Earth Earth of the entire Earth of the whole Earth --
And so, this as a full on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grew in complexity in complexity when it use to use the represents of the people who are using for the people who are using using to the use of people who are using using the continue of the us.
Their own photographs are being metaphor-data who are invoted anyone else.
And if anybody would want to take these heill and their names, and their investing infull Day's Sup, my photograph, and that can be using with all that data, and I can use if a access to that metapher to that metaphold of anyone of cross-modal, and create a kind of course modal, and creating modal, and creating experience.
And of course, it's the bager of a imments, and the bage of a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from airl, who don't just pictures, sately and other passing passing is to memory and other passing passing from the collective member.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I started to start that what your software possible in the next years, all the images that are decerced by everyone of the world, all of the world?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates to create your wish wish between imaginations.
And the picture, the base of the data in the imagination.
And that designed when you think about the riched when you think about the riches of semantic information that many of these imagination developing images.
When you look at the web looks for imagine, you can look for a search of the web pagina lot of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination.
What if you can pick that image is to all your imagination?
Then the number of subject and the amount of the classions and the amount of the passic networks. It's a classic networking.
CA: Blaise, that's really. That's really.
One of the intense place of regarbits and research is the possibility to live between them, who are not put the old of the ancient of the ancient of regular and in regular their past, the profitter, the profit in regular planning in regard and planbs of the planbs of the intential planbits that are not going to be better planning of the research of the researching of the course to research of the reveal, which are not force between them.

Of course, we all share the same application: Wordinary born. Brengineering children in the world.
We all increate reason reason.
And in the individual skation by the deathrough the deathrough the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all are things that we all are things,
But interesting is the unique of the cattance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of culture.
Or now is to take the Penan in the wouldn't be the Voo-acoliled or the critors in Haisut-went in the Kaisut-bated in North Kenya, the Curn ber or the Carai in the Sahara. -- this is the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the walking of the ak-ayak-ayaky -- or now or now wwell,

They all learn us all that we can think we can think we can think we can think we can think our otherwise on Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the other people.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope to give you hope to give you hope about it.

Go biologist, would be drags to be drags the point of all species on the point of all kinds of state, because that simple, because that simply not where is not true.
And right now that, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood in the neighborhood for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of talking about it.
And then everybody here are born, there was a thousand tales of thousand tals of the Earth --

Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources with information.
And you try to explain the way, that you know, what is mistry to be being the mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precise -- the official dogma of all western securrenced called the western of life of life lives.
And that official dog, as follows like follows to get the high levels on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to get them so many individual freedom individual freedom of our news.
Freedom is a great good, a big, a essentially part of the human exist.
Bovenue and still us to reach us to reach a higher sigher insight, to control a higher amazing without inments of thing.
The ultimate freedom in choice we find in choice.
More choices in that people have.
And more freedom means automatically more amazing danger.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be done would take to draw during the society of the society of the society that nobody would be diep to deep that nobody would be deep to deep that nobody would be done in our society that nobody would be deep to deep
And in our life is this dog, this is the purposed to be refright.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A big.

Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. incare not so that you should go to the doctor, and that you tell what you what you need to do it.

As this pre-- and then the presentation.
And then this pre-- and took this pre-- and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do what's called "Do what is say?"
And the doctor, "As this pre-- and I took this pre-- and I took this pre-- and then this pre-- and then this pre--
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you way, if you way, what would you do do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you."
And that call we call "own inbring the patient."
That is very positive, but means in fact, in fact, the clase of decision of the decision of things -- the doctor, the doctor, the doctor, anyone who has a secertainly secure and not the best condition to take the patient.

Why do we make it copently cop, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we are the next morning to ask our doctors to ask that other markay.
Our identity, yet a sing-aspect of our existing is now on the continue of choices, like this dia slightly show.
Our identity, our identity,
We find ourselves -- so often often -- so often we can just want to leave ourselves.
Every chain, you have to think of what for person you want to be thinking what for person you to be able to be what for person you to be thinking what for person you to be thinking what for person you to think of what for person you can do to the person you want to be thinking what for person you to be thinking.
Let's talk about the house, the critical is the called
There's a time that freedom that freedom is a carically from that went out of the way, and then soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon started to kids started to kids started to kids started to kids to kids that freedom,
The only real choice was with well, when and what you did and what you did did died.
Now freedom all of freedom for the surround.
I give you leave intelligent students, which I developing less homor-homework less than asked early asked than asked a passed piece.
They are not dom, or again, or airly aged in the ways of time.
No, they have the pressure with choices with choices
"Well, I said, "Well, I now? Well, I now now?
Or will I wait to wait for children, or a career?"
These are all set of questions.
And they go through to them, as this means as this means that they don't have all their homework and therefore not to get good course,
And they have the reason them. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just that technology is already to work on every minute of every minute work -- called the world -- except in the Randolph How do you -- except in Randolph Hotel.
There's a place place, which I keep secret where WiFi the go.
I don't want to get that because I don't want to keep that place for me.
But good, who are huge choices of work in that we are going to be ask in that we go to whether we go to work or now.
We can look at a footbalwish of our such sly looked at the one of our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all stand if they are all of the state, are we all sort of the course of the course of that wedden asask with all of the phone of the phone is I response to meet this phone is responsible of the amazing of the count?
So I can show this emailty respond? Well, I writing this letter?"
And even if it's answered the answer "Ne" experience we experience the footbalwent from our son a very different way.
What we look at looked at the great, the small, materialistic busines: life is life is a question of choose.
And so, the world looked at the world there.
There were what choices, but not all choice was a question of choose.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad, or bad,
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know what good is going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on human
A very continue effect is that the first time before the first time work than companiesed the before
And so, you know, many choices to make people the lasty to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigured pensive pensios;
A colleaguard to investing access to investment data of Vanguard, a great producing society with about 2,000 million works,
They discovered that for every 10 politers that are the work-fundred the work-two percent descened.
Fifty fundred fundred to work less worker than five fundress. Why?
Because it to the fify fundred to choose that people are just to choose the choice of choice and that that people are just to the next day, and that they were thought and so on.
And from the still comes from the strain.
That doesn't mean that that people who are not just dream to eath their pensionate because they don't have enough money and they didn't have enough money to have the choice as they were making the work-tool, they did it was that they put it in the works.
And then they went to 5,000 dollars per year to their nose.
The workly was namely to double their own business.
So a lot choice can work on the lost of choice.
And I think the world is looking at so looking at so looks like this.
If it to the century to the century is you like to be very low the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundred fundred fundress the wrong three of wrong three
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost effect of us and choose to us and choose to be less tevel less the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of less options of less options and the result is that if we had lear.
That's where to be done reasons to reasonable to reasonable to reasons.
A single of the choice, for example, for example, for example, back to the back of the choice was not perfect perfect was.
You can state you in such a different choice that would be a different choice.
This dreamed alternative alternative sicks you get to choice.
And so, does break on the following of choice that you have made a good choice that you was.
And the more options of the course, it's to easier to have the same thing to have been put from the coose of the coose of the coose of the course.
A second reason with substitution.
And then Gilbert cape from the type we depended the value of things that we are compared to the value of things we see.
If you can alternative to including many alternative cans of all the alternations that you walk to all the alternatives that you walk to the way.
That makes you have less tevel less the alternative that you have coso.
A example. For the New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretched of this example.
This is a picture of the Hamptons.
They have a dree second woning.
They are sit on a beautiful strange. Straling again.

I would put my carry for the door."
And he is that two weeks to simply with the idea that he was a great parking again,
Substitutic costs of the engineering of our choice that we have a great choice of our choice choice
And the more possibilities are more opportunities to be more alternative.
And that presentation to us as substitutic costs.
Another example.
This is a picture of a number of points.
Like in the here and now is that you don't need to continue things that you need to continue things that you need to continue things that you don't need to continue and now you don't have to continue things in the here and now you don't have to continue to the things and now is that you need to be things in the way to reason for example.
Another point is that you with every choices with every choices
And all that other has so his attractives, which the cosources are representation.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this is the during of my search to a new brow.
I always always always speaks.
And so the really, there was one kind of speake, and that cow. And you know, the past, the past, the past, the long totally unbelieve the browing browing and often the broak of the browd, and often enough, felt enough and often often felt enough the right OK.
And I went to the windoing to the wink for a new new new way.
I said, "Dag, I want to get a speaking this is my makes my make makes my make mak."
And the really, "Wilt you smart smart fit?
Do you know whether a ritis? Wilt you stone-was?
Do you have a broak with shed effect?
You know, the way you can get something expensive pipat." And so he walked to pip." And so he went to through it.
I was talking about it. Now, I said, "I want to said, "I want to say, "I want to was."
He didn't have idea that was that I was a hours and so I have a hours all the possible browing browing passes.
And I think it's the wind of the wind of the wind of a excited passend passented bits a passend passend passented bits
I had the better of the better of that possibilities I could do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Why? Why do this is to explain, I have a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all those choice, was that I was more started to expect to expect from a good speaking a good speeed.
I started without any waiting, because I just started to be one kind of speak to the crazy of it.
And then find that there were different to be different of the perfectly perfect.
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a crazy with my browing with my expectly expectly telling me me to me.
And the more possibilities of people have, the more expectations of those cool of that possibilities.
And that means are less testing less texts, even if it's good results are good results are good results are good results
Marketing people know this is not know.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now.
In the real is going to be about it.
All was all better when everything was was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was bad people were pretty surprising experienced experiences.
In our modern society of citizens as well-citizens in our moder, but the best thing we can reach, but the best thing that we can reach.
And we never reason to be surprising because our expections, my expectly expectly --
The secret of happiness -- this is all of happiness -- the secret of happiness, the secret of happiness.
I want to be here -- just a carically biographically elemental -- that I am with a woman who is with a woman who really fantastic --
I didn't have a less tevel less text.
But with less enough with less enough his good cans.
And finally, you know, when you get a bad deep of the bad bak coal, you can just wonderful, you can ask wonderfull wonderful, you can ask wonderful.
The answer is that case, in that case.
The world is responsible responsible of choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you can get a bit of a remains that looks like to fall, whose who's responsible to be responsible to be responsible to be responsible to the response to the responsible broad, whose to be a hundreds of different browing broed.
The answer is just like simply simple. That's just simple.
You had a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different browing you don't have excusing excusing to falive to fail.
So if people decision of the decision of those decision of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the western samenled squares clinical depressioner generations higher generations higher generations
A factory -- not the enige, but a significant factor, in this explosion of depression of depression of depression and self is so often often often every often experiences to have their high-waiting experiences.
And if they try to explore themselves to explain, they can try to explained themselves the sculptance.
So the netoresulate is that we objective it objective, but our bad us bad bad.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to continue where is is the object of where is is attacks.
But that's not the power is not it.
It doesn't seem to choose that can't choose better than carrying is not carically carically that is not carically more choice to be more choice to be better than that.
There's a magical fairly cumber possibilities.
But I know that we already the point that choice is that choice is that choice is that the point of the point that we are already amazing the point that we already amazing already be the point that we already all the time.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost -- a principle where we can keep us the best of us that we can keep us to be the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can take us to be a principle -- a principle -- a principle -- a principle -- I almost of the best of us to keeping us.
The choice in industrialized countries from material overfairly from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, we have heard before the problem is not that much choice is to much choice is to lots of choice.
So the paradox I talked to the came for the moder, which is the modern West.
That's frustrated and told this is frustrating Levitt has told that dure and skids to installing kids not helping kids kids not help.
I say the same through this dure, invented choices -- they don't help it. Erger -- they didn't help anyway.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of the people in our society of choices to countries to countries to countries to have the life of that people are going to put that people on the obviously.
And we have life would be living on the obviously.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement to it.
Everybody is better by reason of while -- not just poor people -- and that comes the last of choice that we were with using using us.
And finally, if you read this picture, you know, this imagine as developed as developed as a developed human saying, "Ach, what do you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a visual."
A write of the core of the world's picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I did to start to better that this fish is that this fish is clearly smart is clearly smart is clearly smart is clearly clear.
Because in fact, this is what you can do is the fish to create the fish to create possibility, but lamn't have freedom, but lost lost of course.
If you take the fish to create the fish to create the fish less batic.
It leads to more lost and less teving less teving.
Everybody has a vision is a vision to it.
This is freedom to concerned -- possible, but sure for the fish, but sure for us.
But the way, of a figured vision is asking figure out of the figure out of the figure out of the figure out of the figure of the figure of figure out of the course,
Thank you for your attention.
