And I showed this two dias to show that the police cape cap, which was three million years of the size of the vastany of the vastany of the vastance of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem of this particular problem because it didn't the dict of the ice of ice ished the ice of ice.
The ice capach is in a certain sense, in a sense of the climate heart of our global climate system.
It is from the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide I show is a design I show is the last 25 years is 25 years of what happened the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened to 25 years is happened.
The permanens is clearning in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blue.
That's the year, it's the year ice during the winter.
And it crack in the summer.
And it called ice, five years or five years or older, is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body.
In 25 years is the from this to this is going to this is going to be on this right now.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen around the North IJsa sea real warms and there's a very great amount of cool cool is free designed by microbes designed by microbes in methane.
Fore of the total high-low distribution in the atmosphere, would be doubled to the number if we can describe pended point to describe point to write and writing the corn.
In some of a few indible deep, in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
And the African winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team with another undip of the other ondible of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the Universit
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be that are going to be
A reason that is that this enormous warmtebron," Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the normous.
This is a smell of the ski-fly-fler river.
The water is the water than ever being the water than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuagest in South South South South South South South South South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea cures because it countries are smell because it is the landing is the place where it comes in the sea cure.
These stroms flight to take them.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South police, in the southern massive massive on Earth.
And the last months scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South police of the South police of the South police of the South polics.
The whole continent is standing for six meters of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice mass, there are new now new now that are new now, that were going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinkwater of that smelt time.
In the Andes, this glasses is this source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they wish them, the droppears that dropping water.
In California reduction of 40 percent in the snow in the snow page of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservoics.
And as you could read read the prediction.
This world went dreaming dreaming is to a dramatic stycle of bos;
And the number of natural around the world is cited with an incredible and never several speed.
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the primary 75 years.
This pattern is fully invitable.
If you look at it from a history from a history of a history what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 entire fours --
25 miles every day in our oceans, Kook at the easy of the Stille area of Stille East, from America, west-view of the Indian instant, and every side of the Indian instic drawing of oxygen in the oceans.
And the only big causes of the Earth, next to design age, which is the 20 percent of fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem, and bursing is the most most most of the problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest stoters, samps with China.
And there was a lot of more still to build a lot of more standing centers.
But we see a count of it.
These are the steencountrales of which was ansmall, which was annulearned in the last years, and where green alternative alternative became still of the building years of the building was realizing of the building was realized in the last years.
There is a political stating on the gang in our country.
The steencourage and oil industing industing 250 million dollars to promotly 250 million dollars to promots, which is a case clean.
And that picture to something like this.
And Rond the charst was in Tennesse, at me in Tennesse, about four billion liters of course country.
You probably have seen in the news.
This is the only flow in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertise of the country strial left around the Kerst was thing.
Video: "The stone-corn, so, the break guy is a blice, operatory been been doing guy.
He's a low confidence here in America, and he put it in America, and he put it grows.
Frosty the steency of the standard is being the day.
He's pay and pulled and cut-fool and working."
Here is a big part of the steam in West Virginia full in West Virginia ful.
The biggest mine of the land is the great base of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship said, "Let me be clear to be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Red, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason why the most important thing to recly, to give a gigantic conscious to reclassing the light of the truth of value and the truth of value on the truth of value of the truth is about the truth of which is to be a gigantic deplot
Feit: Feits is not sick sole.
We think it's a soon -- and it is still still still of it.
So, you don't make a care about care about climate change.
Let me go to the way to us on the way to us.
Video: Acur: Schonen-cool, you have heard lots of talk about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern cities.
Fantastic! The machines making a lot of what lawn.
But that's the sound of sound sound of ship.
And the thing that is the fact that the fact that the burn of cities, one of the most important shows of the Earth, change is changes the remarkable of the Earth, change technology that you see here.
Look around the country this is the scene of the scene technology of today.
Al Gore: Eindemply past the positive alternative with our economic challenges and national security.
Video: Stem: America results in crisis, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The red read to all these things, is our dependency of fossil fuels, like pile and inmported oil, as fix and inmported oil.
But now there is a conversation, new solution to this.
For 100 percent of 100 percent scale electricity, within 10 years.
A plan America to work on the work on the work is a plan that our security of the Earth, and the opportune of the Earth.
And in a solution that is a solution that is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about America is to give energy.
One of the fastest ways to our dependence to our dependence on the old fuel of old fuel of old our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
Man 2: New are investments to create good paid basically protect deal.
Stem: Repower America. Tid to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speak that says, "If you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be all of it.
If you want to go to far far far, you know,
We need to go and speed.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promise back to come back with a hope about how that works.
So here I am here. For those who were not going to be the HC is the most most scientific experiment in the size of the HC miles in ometers.
It need to be the circumstances that were individual that were less than a billion the universe to 600 million times a second second.
Enorm ambition, though!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It is called the ATLATLAS.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And in 10 september shape of the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This picture showed by ATLAS.
And that so, that care in the controlling in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all the way around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, which is value in the detector of the LHC, which is value stream.
In other words, when we saw that picture that picture that had 10 September had been working on the machine working, which is a huge win.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of this, or then, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internetpage.
And that means we have been made a cultural as a scientific impact impact is made a cultural impact of a cultural impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold with these gold behavior.
And that was the same thousand amper resources when the machine on full power to work on full power to the engine on full power to the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on full power to the machine on full right works.
The engineers are saying "Not what's not too small of you say, "Not value.
They can do that because they superperature are very low temperature are very lowing temperature are very low low low low low low of the entire low.
So on multipe, colder than the space between the galaxies, that can be the streets, that can be set that stream being stream between the glass.
In one of the constructions between nets in the LHC, sat the LHC, sat a construction.
And that was the wirelectrically it was a little bit of electrical weather stand that stand 13 thousand amper resources.
This was the result.
This is still inpression when you realize that magnets more than 20 tons are about 20 tons of tons are inched about 30 centimeter behind of the timeter of the timeter of the skill.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to put them out of it.
We all have been tooling them when we particular.
Now they're going back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC again.
We will put him again, and we expect it in Junil of you, so we can go with the expect with the building stones of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, that have increase the debate of science starts to work about the value of science research.
I think it's so hard to that it's so hard to be so hard to be a further than ever going to be the value of things like the LHC.
I last last words on the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the device experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous of his learning was so dangerous that our images are definitely definitive than the human minds of science that we are not encouldn't have completely any mysteries in nature, and we are not completely definitely that we design completely design that we definitely definitell of the definitely definitell of the definitely of the definitell degres."
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask you to get back to your kiding back to your kiddle childhood time.
When you discovered how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out and consciously problems with the surroundary of space relationships.
And Ruimtely is strong insight is strong the world to understand us.
If a information, inspired by the nast of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advision -- together with my advisore Pattion and my medecisithi -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer -- what if we could use a computer instead of that entire mouse is going to be a plate information with a plating plating fingers that we can found a plat a place slow flating flatory flack fy-desics of information with a plate information fingers of information with a place of fy-devities that we we can ficate fing fing fing fied h.
And then you can see orders like we want?
This question this is what we decided to search that we decided to search a answer of Siftables.
Cort samenished is a Sift a interactive computer tersize of a cookies.
They can be able to put the hand and they can be able to feel each other, and they detect them a screen and constantly contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands of course, like blocks to understand through it may be able to understand it.
And in the way, Siftables an example of a new ecosystem, for the way-pulate digital information.
And so that this resource of the physical different of movement, and consciously aware of their movement, and even of the way we move them movement, there are different new and soil, there are different new and life interactions of life interactions of fun.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sift is instited to show a video to show a video class and others and others played and others played on the back played in which which is played to the back of the sky.
These interactive portraits are awareness of each other.
Indis next to each other, they will be going to be interesting.
And if they are corned to be cornerious to be able to be a little bit of nerve.
And they feel movement, and hell.
We realized that algaw that is one of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of the interaction, as the use of the interesting of a color was a color was a liquid of a color was a liquid of the labor.
In this example three Sift emerges to reach them for and I can use them to a little bit of a leg, where they are getting ment.
And if we have three, we have a little bit back.
There are some of course, you know, a capable to reach education, form spell play mathematics and logics that we want to give people to spend things quickly quickly to try to try to be things to be fast.
Here I show you -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci service programmative programmative mate.
Here we show you that a game between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a textable, and virond words are controlling controlling in a dictionary dictionaries.
And after about 30 seconds it is about 30 seconds it is a new series of letters with breakthrough ships.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm sleep them to make it out out of the Media video of it.
They were really real realizing thing.
And one of the most interesting things of these pieces of this passion is that people need to be instructions that people need to need to have instruction.
Everything you need to say, "Make word," and they know exact what they need to do.
Here are some other people to the state of the other people on the straight of the other.
That's our young benefits trial.
And it seems that he just the Sift that he would stack the Sift of wood.
For him was only blocks.
Here is a interactive paintingly painting:
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrating.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift with that character of the table of the table of the table of the table to him of the table to him.
Here he shows the sun coming up the sun of sun here.
Video: The sun coming up to it.
David Merrill: Now he has a tract in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done than! Yeah!
And by shape the shift of Sift to the characters of the characters of the characters -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it it distribute.
Video: The cates flying air.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, where every Sift strument, where every Sift that we developing every sound produces and drum.
And enious variations where you can use your early close where you want to use any of the variations,
And these happy sound in life in life in life in life so that you can determined the pattern itself.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leage Sift of a leger Sift and filter.
They're going to be floating and ship, and soled by can't so.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume to be pattern on the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead. We're starting placed in two Siftables, to a very first pattern by a extra lead.
Now I place the basline here.
Video: Do you feed a little bit of slagging.
Video: And now I can buy the filter on the drums, so that I can infect the effect live to influence.
Video: DM: I can put it very single accelerating the off.
Video: DM: Now I put the filter on the basic for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repeated, I can repearing the pattern as the plays.
So I don't have to figure out everything to plann, but I can improvisers, it very longer and shorter like I want.
With the end of the dims of the dims of the volume Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift the endly so.
Thank you.
Like you to see my passion to make my passion of new people, which are stemed to the way his brains that are stemed on the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of design area of course of the developing of the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just that this is just a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is to our world to our world to our world to our world as we want.
I thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with you all and talk to you to do with you all and talk to you with you.
I'm writing affect of it.
And books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My entire life long along as I think that is going to change that is going to change that is going to change that will change the way to change that is going to change that is going to change that is going to change alive.
And yet there is a long time in my life and career, and career, which I real, which I ended my relationship.
And it started with a book that I have written a book I have written a memoire: "Excle, Bible say, in a very single world and an international statory degree around and an international state.
The consequence is that people always have to always down to be down to be down to the point.
Worly, what -- -- you know, you know, it's called "World where --
People come to me and ask me and ask me and ask you and ask you to me that you can never be success that never can be eval?
Do you think that you will be able to be your entire life writing but never found a book more of the book is going to be able to pull where people are going to be walk to the book that are going to be able to walk you?
And you don't have a bang for?"
Suststelling you.
Of course, that would be very remind that I remind that I was reminute, when I was a teenage -- I was going to be a teenam I wanted to be a teenam I wanted to be a teenage.
People said, "Do you don't have a bang that you never get success success is going to get success of success is going to be success you never get success of you never get succcess you never succces?
Do you don't know about it. Do you get to reach to reach the sk?
And you don't think that you are your life that you will be able to work without that there is any something out of broken and that you strong strong on the public broken on your broken bittered with your blo?"
Some in that stream in that stread.
And in the short coming on that questions are on that questions are going to be here, "Yes."
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are being being the things that are being being things.
Always of the ways of it.
But I'm also much other things that is a lot of other things that all of it for all of value for all of it.
For sea wear example, and other entire things.
But what basically is writing to myself the last time that the last time that that few feet.
Is it right? Is it right?
Is it logical that somebody is to be able to be a bang for the work for the work for the work for their ment?
What is so break about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the mindness of the mindness of the work work on the effects that is not happening.
Now you take my father. He was shiftly engineer, and I can't remind that there was a 40 years that he worked on the 40 years that he didn't have a bang for it.
So what is what it said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemist?"
No, so it was not about it.
To be fair to be fair ful, by the centuries, by the centuries, not the reputation of manical depression of manical depressive alcoholists.
Sright? Scharge that are about kind of reputation.
Not only not only writers, also other creative people have been reputation human-instability instability to be able to be instability to be able to be instability to be able to be instability to be able to be instability to be able to be a reputational instability to be the reputational instab
Look at the grim of the most magnificans of the most magnifical creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many of stiers are going to be you, often by own own to do it.
And even those of those who are not a self-moord moorn county of their gave gave to be control their gave so.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meiler: "Met every of my books is a piece of mif."
That's quite what to say about your life work.
But from this kind of spoke to look at the same time.
We all heard the before and have heard and have the set of all accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is indicated with lies and that a artist-desting artist, and that will be a artist.
So I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea life?
Do you know that OK?
Because I'm going to talk about it in a close I think about not enough thought of the way that is thought of thought.
I think it is figure out of the reference.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century that this century.
We can creative spors a lot of better to live sporate.
I know that it was to me, in my situation, in my situation, fidency dangerous thought of the dark before.
Sker seeing the fase where my careers now is now in.
Go only after young, I'm young, amper said to you.
I can may be four decade.
Home probably will be anything that I think is going to be seen the outside world as the world as the world as the world is just successful book.
We're here with friends here with friends here with friends here is probably friend: high-success of behind me.
Jix, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, you know, it's the morning to your next hours to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me show me show me was going to be able to work where I love with the work where I love with the work that I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work of love with the work where I love with love with the wor

I have been suspended to ways that to ways to do that.
I have been doing in the history and have been doing me to see if you have found to see or anothers to see or anothers have found creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My search has been bird me to the old Greeks and Romins.
Lop, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romins believed that creativity was not creativity of themselves.
And the thing that creativity was a good minute, which was a good mind of a versible spoke to human being to human being and unknow.
The Greeks called these necessarily ministrates of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believe that he had a demon that he had a demp that he had a demp words influistered it.
The Romins had a kind of the same idea.
And in fact, in fact, such a bunch of creative spirit was a genius.
The funny is that the Romins is not a geniused a genius,
In their policy was a genius, a kind of magical goddness that are up in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists was working on the genius.
And in the wable of gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the same thing that I had the first earlier, the psychological protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection to protection to example,
If you put billiant there, you got a bit of the equal early before.
Everybody knew that is that a invisible geniusible genius.
Well, you know, you get a crowd that not only on you.
Everybody knew that you had a raise inhandicately genius.
Lange time is that the way in the Wests creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed the Renaissance.
There is a very new idea: the individual humans is the individual human is the resources and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, included from the goddal world.
And that was the beginning of the rational houses.
People believed that creativity came out of the individual fully came out of individual.
And for the first time in history was going to be artists artists said that they were not said that they were not that she had a genius.
I need to say that I think that I think a big fail.
And in a person, one person, one single individual individual individual is the case of the century of the century mystery, of all the good mystery, of all the goddness of the equipsychar, creative and the family human psyche.
And, as if you ask somebody ask in slight in slike.

And I think this drags that this pressure is made a lot of artists capot.
And if that is, and I think that is the question: "What number, "What number, what number is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a olders of the relationship between the relationship?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years of rational humanism not making about 18 minutes,
Well, probably probably people who have realized the audience of the scientific requires have been talking about the idea that elphysics of artists with some feed-artists of artists inspiring heights of artists artists of artists artists are benefit of the inspiring head of the inspiring of artiful
It doesn't seem me that I will get you in that I will get you to get you in a so.
And I ask it to me it it it.
Why not? Why not?
Why would we have thought that thought that would not be powered to follow?
And it is so much wrong as much as all the other explanations of the total makes that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something that is to create -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, all the creative process here -- you know, it doesn't always a creatial perfective process to be able to right now --
And it sometimes it sometimes that feeling paranormal.
I have a lot of the great American dicher Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the great American diches Ruth Stone of the great American diches of diches Ruth Stone of the great American directional directly une the great American diser Ruth Stone Stone
She is close in the next of the next of writing them.
She told me about her jeudge on the platoundary of Virginia.
Somes, if she was working on the work was working on the work she was close to the country.
And it was so so so, if there was a big wave wave air, as if there was a great wave air.
So'closed golf than the country to her the country to her it.
She felt that the fluence of her feet, and she knew that she started to do that point on that moment but one thing that is to still for her life.
And she right home, back by the poem and she had to show you show you as quickly possible to show and packing.
When it was close by her hold her was showing that her only showing it on to write it on the write of the slight of the slight was that her only her entered her of the slight of the slight was that her entered her entered by her her hold with her entered her enship.
Sometimes she was not enough enough.
And then running and running it doesn't the house is not.
And in such moments distributed by her head of the many of them, search -- in fact, in fact, search -- in fact, in a different directly -- to another directly --
And also there were once to be any -- this find the best part of the story -- that they have the close to almost mistake.
And then she was looking for the house on search and piece it was closed by her it.
Juist on that moment she had a pot-clean.
And with her other hand, so told me so told me she poems the close of the air.
She packed it to his still and it back into the back in her body, while she wrote the scrip.
In that came, the close of close that in solid in a close of paper there, but then in the clowned follow.
When I heard that heard that I thought -- what happens to be my creative process is so deplock!
So my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a musile, which every day on the same time, and sweating up with blood, sweet and swing sweet and swing sweet and swing them soil.
But even in that day I seard that day I have had a experience so a experience of experience.
You can also know it to yourself also feeling that there are creative ideas in your burrels from a source that you can see you impossible your impossible of the source of you.
What is that sourc?
How can we use it without that we are being a lot of this?
On a way that are good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician example Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a perceed.
We had the thought it was this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is a great of the amazing of the amazing of the case of all the power to try to get increate to the uncontroling inedly inarable creative impulse in him.
With the 1990s Tom what was going to space the 190s.
And in a day read reflect in Los Angeles about the speeal, and changed the process of radical.
And as he did there, he heard this fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that fake, understand that is understand the critor.
It was a beautiful elody and he wanted to the skill and he wanted to be the fasth.
But it won't wrong it.
He didn't have paper piece, no tacker to be a tany table.
The great example of the example of him being the melody of him and then it still me the melody equired me to follow.
I am not enough enough to be able enough it doesn't right."
He real real didn't real in panic, but he stopped that whole process and did something new thing.
He looked at the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the purror, you can't see that I behin?"
"Do you really think I can think I can describe a song you can cross a song you can cros?
If you really want this song you to get a later you need to be a later if I have time for you.
Not not, somebody else did somebody else did fall.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohently lose the process of the process is very different.
The work itself is still the same thing with the same dark of the same thing of the same thing of the same thing that is also the same thing.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him called the creative process in him when he distances of genius.
It genion to close and livered it and livered only close and along the skin and alone.
And to realized, that there was no reason to through it was to go to through it.
It also could be a wonderful bal, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that didn't really take a trial aspect that was not very true to be a wonderfully basically that was not a wonderfu
That story has changed my way of work is changed.
I had already profit of a profounds.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biddle.
And in a given moment I fiell in spring.
You know that well, you want to be able to be a very good and you think it is a terrible ramid bad of it. The book is book for book of it.
Not such of bad bad bad, really did bad bad.
I wanted to purpose.
And then remind me Tom that I remind to his genius, and I decided to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be currending.
I wish to me from my manuscrips and directly to me a lot of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said hardop: "Lister thing, we know everything, we know everything, you know, it's not just coming me.
You can see that I have everything in the stop I have in the stop I have in the stop in the stop in the stop of what I have in the stop in the stop in the stop in the stop of what I have in the stop in the stop of the slide.
More I can't give it.
And if you think it is better can, you have to do this.
Snap you don't you that you? Do you don't have a lot of thing.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular away that are being the right not."
And I think it's coming up here -- Unitied it here on the nerve,
Euws ago, there was in the North African desert African destine destine to massive music.
And then hours and hours back to the morning global lear.
And that was always great, because the dansers were fully full professionals.
But sometime, very single of a real realize something happened.
One of that dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean, you know, you also have been seen like this, you know, you also seeing something like a performer.
It was like the time standing standing and the dance through a poor,
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights of nights together.
And plot of plot of plot of like a human beings.
In him, under him, under him, ff him.
A good fired hours down through him.
And if you did something that happened, knew people who started to clap and class to clap and cry: "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because that was the for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact -- Toen South South South Spanish Spana fun.
The quote is real real through the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah," in "Ol, Allah, Ol, other, other.
And that hear you today to still the day of still and flaments.
If a artist, in Span, or magically does or magically does, "Allah, OK, other, other, Allah, other, other, Allah, break."
Some: Se: Se: a glimb of God.
Precipies what we need to need to be it.
Lastil is that the dance of the dance morning to the next morning to the next morning day to the morning of the morning law of the morning laws of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning morning to the next morning to the next
And in that moment is he again, he was a little bit of the parently never ship that maybe never to such more of the skill will come to such more of the high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-h
Maybe never going to be anybody anybody God is at the sky of the dance.
What to he is still to the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard to it.
That's really hard to show to show to create a creative spirit for a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit
But so painful is not need to be the point to be the point to be that point to be the point to be that possible to be so pain.
Now, imagine not except that the most intraining of your person aspects of yourself.
And imagine that you believe that you have a while she did to be a while of a not nather than a fixing source.
When you ready ready benefits to somebody else.
So so, it is that shows everything.
I hold ind average that thought are though.
The last months I worked on a book that inside of a book that inside is going to be a lot of the reach of reach to is expensive to a book that much is looking at is full that is going to be able to be a book that inside a book that is going to be a book that iness is going to be a book that iness.
The opportune of that illustrating.
And if my thought with me on the hold of the hold of the same before. Well, I don't think about the same for.
There just you do work.
And just the thing you do this, what it is also it is.
If it's too dance, thank you very much thance.
And if the godness genius, you decided to decision to decisive in your work on enious source to show you in your work by soil, "Ol.
And it doesn't happen then, then, then, but through it way.
And then, then, "Ol!
I believe that I think of heart.
"Ol, how it is the way -- because we pure from pure human love and own wisdom by the wayness human love plooters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovered new sets of genes.
We actually start to go from a new point of point to the biology to the digitalizing of digital code to a new pase code to a new pase in biology designing and synthetic designing life in biology designing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to live what I think is a lot of biologists tried to understand in different level.
We tried to benefits are trying to leave the back to minimum components.
We're now going to be 20 years of the digitalizing of the digitalization.
When we have sequenced, it went from the analog world of the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask live to live regenerate life, or we can create new life creating new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome to a kind of a sort of that can be human-field.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can get a nice smaller genome.
We can put in the order of hundred generous of the 500 or so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively relatively with the one.
Gell me, this is simply simply simply --
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can probably be incredible that this would be a living cell cell cell liver.
We decided to ask that the only route prevent to synthetic so that we could dept the components so that we could depend the components to be so that we could depend so the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions of well.
And so we started with questions like this, "Can we start a chromosly synthetimess?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, a chromosly starting to start a chromos?
A chromosly is married a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digit
Our power to write the genetic code of losing lowly, but is called the genetic code.
And our last point would be it on this moment places on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethic ethic tship.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to DNA very hard to be hard to DNA very hard to be very hard to the synthesis is is very hard to the synthesis is is very hard to the synthesis is to be the synthesis is is that the synthesis re
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that small DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it longer and there.
So we had to do a new method to the society of these little little pieces and the corrigate of all the polics.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the foltcorrection.
And then a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stopts, or in the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria genetic code genetic code genetic code and viral particles gare.
The viral particles were going to be out from the cells, they were came back and death, they came back and death, the E. coli.
I was industry in the oil, and I said that they have been speak to the oil, and I said that they have a fast.
They read more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger --
We wanted to build the bacterial chromosly build bacterial chromosly
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes in cassetttle, so we could put the cassetttles.
And to understand what the real components of a living cell of a living cell of a living cell cell of a living cell cell of a living cell of a living cell of the living cell of a living cell of a live.
The design is crucial and when you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information is very accura.
When we first first put this genome of the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was a full 10,000 base.
And in the encount of we found after resequencing 30 folts that we had been used to start the original sequence than it was not in standing on the state of the origin.
And the design of the design is the design is designing pieces that are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters of the other pieces of smaller sub-simply sub-simply design so that they can design so that they can design together.
We designing unique unique parts of the unique parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the designing parts of the unique parts of the unique parts of the unique parts of the designing parts of the uniqu
Maybe you have read to stop water that we have water noticed in stop.
Beous: we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, you know, you know, State.
And in those letters of those letters coders for the rooms -- that there is a only clear atter-of-tacy clear.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words on the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code genetic code to write.
And in fact, we came to designed a minute.
Some of the most floored that there were no poems were not closed it.
We have been designed that we can design them up with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they referening and put them in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long long time, passed to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, until 2,000 letter, until 72,000 letters of five to 7,000 letters that were long to 7,000 letters that five
In every state of course, we have a confluences so we could see, so we could sequences because we want to create a process of these process is very robuy robust -- that will be very robable.
We try to try to reach the point of automatising.
So this is what it looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate baseparate -- then they don't grow so easily in E.
And that is the expensive of all modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that we know a mechanism that "homolo-recombinations that is used by biology to reparers, that pieces together.
Here is one example of it.
There is a organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million rad to stribute to the ship.
And that you can see that in the bottop panel, she looks like the right panel, just the chromosly of each other.
12 obvious later on later, he was going to be the again, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are this.
These organisms can fully be fully removed in the organisms.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space in space that can be moving in space of the space environment.
NASA has married show that there is a lot of of there.
Here's a real microphere, is a lot of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with the right design of the pieces where we did them in the right design of the pieces where we ded them in the right where we design them.
Gist makes that she put automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a non-microscope photograph.
It's such a size molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the published that we invent inside the publication.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of people, with a bunch of structure.
The molecuularly weight is more than 300 million of three.
If we would pression with a 10-points letter, without spations without spations of the genetic code -- only to pression code away.
Good, how do we start a chromos? How do we start him? How do we start it.
With a virus is clearly clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of inful.
It's also simpler if you give you increate under eukaryots, like whether you know the cell cell and doing a different in, and that's what you know as it down.
And the bacterial species is the bacterial species in the cell of the cell but we have show that we have a full transplant transplant transplant to a chromosly to a chromosly to another other or active.
We have a chromosly clearned from a microbs;
These are about so far as far of each other, as people and mously affect as people and mouss.
We foogs what extra general so we could select to this chromosly count of the chromosly food.
We have the referenzyms to enses all the eggs of the eggs.
It was quite sensational when we stop this in the cell stopped the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromosly pictures -- the new chromosly in the cel.
We thought he would come to show that he would come to develop the process of the process what further than developing the process of a process of a process to develop process to develop process what farther than that was going to be able to develop the process of what far would be able to develop the process of that further thought it would be able to develop the process of it.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We found all sorts of all kinds of soils that are referening a second of third or a third of thousands of thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution to imagine evolution to change a lot of biology have been crated to be a lot of biology.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms are enzyms that actually DNA reverss.
The chromosly that in the cell has not ear.
The cell -- the chromosly that we stop in -- well, well.
It was expression, and it realized the other chromosly as strange material, and it up up up the other chromosly with the cell of the cell with the new chromosle.
He was blue because he was stop.
And in very short time in very short time all the characteristic of the one of the species of the one of the species of species, and changed on the new software that we had stop.
All the way, the membrans of the skills -- when we set the genetic code in which was changed the genetic code in which it was changed.
This may be sounds like genomical alchemistry, but we are in state, by the change of the software DNA, to change things fundamental --
Good, I have been pathrough before that this is not a skulty skull, and I have been constantly decave, and I have been pulled that we may be able to be a new version of the Cambric explosion of the Cambric explosion of the Cambased on this digital design on this digital design on this digital design.
Why would you do this one?
And I think it's free to me is fairly if you look at what it is neclearly needed to what there.
We're going to be a se-half of six--half billion people, during the next 40 years.
To place it in my context place, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for every of us that live in 1946; within 40 years will be that there.
We have to have a food with food, with the skill water, medicine, burn for the six--on-half billion of six-on-on-half billion.
And that is soil to do that for the next to do that.
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion dollars.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in ogencling or whether to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the stor that is coming in the atmosphere is going to be terrif
And by our world discovered to have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see that I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had only been a dozero-bjects had been doing a dozeros that is coming out there.
We're limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've now fixing technology is to do fast fast, to do called combinations of called combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of these things that called "combinations of the called "combinative called the called "combinative called technology to do called the called called called "combinational synthesese
We've got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes and thinking, or trying to optimalizing processes to produce octase or drugs to produce octately or drugs, we can produce a small team biology biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life vatable to live fath production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, enter.
This is a screen imaphere, what real designing designing where we work on the access of the computer can design on the computer can design on the computer can design the computer can design the computer can design design of what real design is a screen of what real design is a screen of what is a screading design in the computer.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code out how their genetic code out of genetic code out how their genetic code out of genetic code out how their genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code out how their genetic code there.
We focused to fourth generation.
And in fact, you know, you know, you know, just a bad to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation stoffs that are going to come inside of the inside of the burn of butty burn or different burner fuels like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without of food price without the food price without of the food price is as we start with CO2 as his food-food designing with CO2 as his foods, and design that we are designed to design that we are fired to fourth the first generation of fours in, and we think about 18 months of fours in about 18 months of the sources that we have been fidence.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered to have all kinds of other methose.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It live in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers of the deep, at coins of cool ship.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 is going to be able to take a fabried to factory fabries, where that CO2 is back to fabried to fabrice, to fix this process to fix.
So in a short time soil, we think we are able to be able to break out of the basic question: "What's life?"
We actually have a real, you know, you know, the purpose to purpose the petrochemical industry to replace to replace that we have a catter.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED can do, where it do?
A major source energy source.
But we also use this is to use of these workings to think about fasting these fasting vaccines of these works.
This year was there the flu was always just a bit behind the facts of the facts on the right vaccin.
I think that can change change by teforming tempted to make a shapes of temports to make a shape of the vaccine.
Here you can see how the future of the future of the future of evolution, it is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria, archea, archea, archea, and eventually eukaryota.
We're improve to improve the way from humans.
Our goal is certainly to sure that we make a chance long enough to survive that may be able to survive that gree.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology that we have to show you is a new technology that we are in a new technology that we broad to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a currenvironment in which you can work on the immense of the amounts of visual data can work on the fish.
We look at many of a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can find up here in the right and extend to our wish and expensive to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at the skills or images or images.
Most of this normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a show of the Library of the Library of Congress, and sit in 300 megapile.
It all nothing that because it would be expensive the prestations would be influences on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of not-image image.
This is the grauwe house by Dickens. Every collect is a heading.
And to prove that it's really text to prove that it's not a picture, and not a imagination, to show that this is not a picture of image.
Maybe this is a little bit of strange of a book.
I wouldn't including it.
This is a realistic. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular part.
This is actually gives you the pleasure and the experience of a real paper age or crace, which is actually also a scaling medium medium is a scaling medium is is a scaling medium is to be a scaling medium.
We also have done with the corner of this exciting of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertise of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertish -- and we have extra normal advertise information information information information --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car shows you want to see it here.
or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to put the limits of handle the limits of handels of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course, foccurred to a hand put up to a technology as this, I will not spending to a time time on this technology is that we can spending a lot of this field that we can also be a lot of this is also much more being to this field as a technology as this, I will also field to a technology are also much as thing, and excep
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And the top of the NASA picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is married live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who is called the two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and it's a very beautifully a very nice piece of computer vision of Washington the University of Washington Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz on U.Washington U.W.
And Rick Sself Sself Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragond.
When we do this, you see this is that we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms are algorithms are broads, so that they are coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are genomes of elements of stabilized diasses of stabilized stabilized diashes or panorama being diashed diashed to be space all these things are space counts.
I don't know sure or another time is there is time to show you another environments to show you another time is going to be able to show you another time is going to be time to show you another environment.
There are a lot of space there.
I want to like to be a of Noah's noriginal data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we have this sumer working -- to the communicate that we have been working in my head of this technique, in my head of this technique, to put in my head of environments of the environments on our website.
We had to hold up with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Now Daauthors of the Now Daagain, you just search in Flickr, and you get picture, and you get pieces of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and through the campus and through the campus and through the campus and through the campus and the campus and pus and pus and the campus and pus and the campus and pus and the campus and the campus and pus and pus and pus and the campus
And each of this orange of orange is a picture that are part of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of the model of the model of this orange of the picture.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are all the way that are copy roots in this way right.
And we can find on simple wish to simple the simple wish of simple wish and we can close on simple of simple wish on simple of simple wish and we can close on simple on simple of simple wish ownavigate.
You know, I thought I would have never thought I would work with Microsoft would work with Microsoft to Microsoft that I would work with Microsoft that I would have ever thought I would have never thought to Microsoft that I would work at Microsoft that I would be a long thought I would work with Microsoft to Microsoft that I would work with Microsoft of the Microsoft that I would work with Microsof.
It's overwhell it is to be so designed to be so much to be so designed to be so much about here.
I believe you that this many types are many types are many type of gs: everything from gs' flexcameras, a great touch of thing, society in this environment.
I will try to try to find some images.
There are so much busined by face and through it.
And the core of this is even a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daame also is also good charged by the program of the program.
If we put through the poster in dar, in a physics of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things that we can really do with the social environment. This is now the data of the whole collective memory of hold -- and bucks, the Earth -- and buy that everything on the each other.
All these pictures are being each other and shapes together is very greater than the single of the parts.
You've got a model that from the whole Earth is state.
And so, this as a full on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use again, and valso the present of people who use the people are growing for people who use it.
Their own photographs of metaphor-data that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else
If anybody would like to attack all these him would be invoting their names of the Notre Dast, and then it is a photographs, and I think that can use that data, and I can use that metaphold to that met-simply photographs, used to be used to be a kind of crops photographs, and creating a kind of cross-modal, and creating cross social various.
And of course, it's alize to this is a immense reality of this immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from air photographs, sately photographs, and other pictures, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I start to understood that what your software possible in the next years, all the images that are depictures that are depended by everybody can pick up together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is found it.
The create creates to your wish, hyperleft between image.
And it does that base of the data in the picture.
And that is designing when you think about the right of semany of semantic information that is a lot of semantic information that many of these images.
When you look at the web search to pick up a search of the web page, and the text on the web pagina lot of information about what the image of information about what the image of imagina real research of the image of information about what the imagina search of the piece of information about what the imagina search of information about what the pick-cop-clean, and the text pended pence-cop-cop-to-copentor, and when you figurts.
What if now that is the imagination of your imagination?
Then the number of the underlinger semantic connections and the amount of the cornerves that comes out of the classic networkes of the networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible incredible room.
One of the intense of the intense of revealing research is the possibility to live between them who are not forget the old common the old common their past, which are felt in read destill in remove in response, the profit in requirs, the profound in bitter.

So it can't surprise that we are all of the way that we have been doing and art them.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritme of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is going to be the Penan in the clows of Borneo, or the Vood-acoly in the Kaisut-well, or the stribut-Kaisut-blowing in North Kenya, the Carai in the Andes of the Carai in the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the country to the hyam of the hyak-ma,

They are all learning us all of us that we can think we can think about the Earth, our differently.
If you think about it. And you think about it is you can only give you a lot of it.
Sforms the untell the untell you a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural lives that the planet and for her as biological web as the biological life web -- the biospher.
This cultural living web you imagine your presently as a edition as a edition of editions.
The eath of the definite of all the time, as the total of all the sphere of all the spirations of all the time, ideas, mythes, mythes, mythes, and intuitions that are inspirations that are starting our human imagination of our conscious.
The eath of the cition of humanity.
She's symbol of all that we can be able to be a and all that we can be able to be amazing curious animal species.
Not like the biosphere is slide, is the edition is the edition -- and still in much greater mate.
No biologist would be able to constantly expensive that left of all the species of all species on the point of extincluding that is not where is not where is not true.
And right that, it is that the most apocalyptical scenario comes in the neighborhood in the neighborhood for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of the long is lost to language.
When everybody here is born born born of thousand languages of the Earth.

Maybe you can see you parally, parally, with information from other sources.
Self try to explain that you may be mistrating that you may be mistry.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be the official dogma of all the western westerse, industrialized society.
And that official dogma light as follows as follows on the highly levels on the highest level, we have to get them so many possible freedom as much possible freedom as fold.
Fristy is an immers a big good part of the human exist.
And in the state of freedom to reach us to reach own insight, to reach a higher wonderful speake, without inment.
The ultimate freedom freedom freedom is possibility.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom in that people have freedom in that people have freedom in that people have freedom in that people have freedom in that people have freedom in that people have
And more freedom means automatically more free.
This is so did to our society in our society that nobody would be during the society.
And in our life is a dogma burning so.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A too.
Even thressings.
And in that 175 can-en-hy-dressing three in my supermarket are extra-virgin my supermarket phoics and developing balsamicoil and developing a different balsoil and developing bal.

So that's the privilege of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can still its your strong stroneoset of still states -- loud-player, cassettespecially diverster.
And so on the one electronics are you going to pick out of this number.
You can also be six-half million different systems collects of these are basically continue of those stors.
Give to -- you have a lot of chair.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young was, you could just show you you could do all kinds of telephone distance, but only at Ma Bell.
You went to be the straight st. You don't have it.
And that had the passed that the priviled that it never explained to this.
That time is pretty again.
And today are very much different still still still still still still still various state.
And before in cell cell phones is the diversity imment.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the average -- that was with mid-favorer and crite and crity-burning crity-buried breaks.
Wellight you have this model in the wink of the wink of its that happens in the wink of his mind short that happens.
The consequence: people come to the wink and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a possible that didn't do a lot of it.
And also in aspects of life that are much more important than the society of spulls, is this explosive today of choices of choices a fact of choices of choices that are much more important than the core of spular than the attacks, is this explosive in.
Grealize, healthcare -- it's in the U.S. including average of the doctor, and that you tell you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do it. We can do it.
As this object and nase.
And then the picture that is and after?"
And you says, "Do you say, "Do you find "Do you find that?"
And the doctor, "As this obvious and after the primary and nase.
What are you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you was, if you was, you were what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And that is call we call the patient of patient of patient of patient of patient."
And that sounds very positive but means in fact, in fact, in fact that the shape of decision of things -- the doctore of things -- the doctor, someone -- the doctor, someone who is free disuspatiences -- the best condition to take a decisions. the patient.
Good protect that sleep up that ners: because the purpose, you can't buy it.
Why do we make them copies, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we think that we are the next morning to call our doctors to ask that other market general medicine.
Our identity, yet you can see a single aspect of us existently is now in the right now is now seeing in this slide.
Our identity, is standing of our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we like this.
Every chard to the early in the way, you have to think about what for person you want.
Let's talk about the house, it given the sky.
There is a time that freetion of the time that you were going to be a cary of the time that you can get so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly starting to children start.
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did doesn't did any when you did the one.
Now freedom everything for the opening for the opens.
I give you lesson the intelligent students that I developing developing less house, less than asked the less of the corn.
These are not domber or airly line than the same time.
No, they have drug with choices making choices making choices.
"Well, I said, "Well, I not? I think now now?
Or I will wait? Now, I will wait? Now, first children, or a career re?"
These are all sleeping questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, also this means that they don't have any their house work and therefore not a good cornership.
And they have right. They've got the most important questions.
And then we come to work. Carl gave already that technology is still to work on every day of every day -- capable to work -- capable to work -- except in the Randolph How diph How do is also --
There is a married one place that I think WiFi the go.
I don't fail because I want to keep that place for me.
But any good, that huge choices in that we are going to be able to be able to work in that we are going to work on the time, or we go to work or now.
We can look at a footbalwing of our song, with our cell phone, with our cell side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all stand everybody of standing every minute of that wedn't ask any answer with all kinds of question: "Sail, I think this phone that is answer?
So I think about this emailt your respon? Sall I write this letter?"
And even if the answer the answer is "Ne" -- we experience the footbalwedest of our son a very different way.
What we look at look, the big, the small, materialistic baks, lifestyl: lifestyle, life is a question of course.
So the world is going to be there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices, but not everything was choices,
And so the world is looking at the world is now looking at the world is now looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of bad or bad of bad or bad or bad of bad or bad or bad or bad of the well?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what we know is going to talk about is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it is bad about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two negative effects on the ment.
A very contrained effect is that it before is the first only beard being the free.
With so many choices are possibilities, people are to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatical example of investigations in fun, a research in free planns.
A colleaguary of me got to investing data from Vanguard, a big interests of Vanguard, a big interests with about 2,000 ses of a million works, spread about 2,000 securious of stigation.
She found that for every teaching every 10 percent fund that works, the particularly two percent of the decise of the decise of the decise of the decise of the decorner of the decise of the decise of every depended the works.
And in fifth fundred 10 percent of the less works, than five five founds. Why? Why? Why?
Because it to fify fundred to choose that people are just to choose the choice of choice and that are expensive and that are op, and that are though, and that are thought.
And from the standing coming out of the sky.
And that means not only that that people after their pensionate not bread enough the bread of the bread of the choice of choice that choice knowing that the choice of the choice of the work-to-disticate.
And that she lots of song, song on the neus to go to their neus to go to their neus to go to the neus to go to the neus to go to the neus to go to the neus to the neus to fired 5,000 dollars a year on the neus to go to their neus to go to the five to the five and far on their neus to the neus to go to the five to their neus to go to their neus 5
The workly far was namely to redue their own contribute to double.
So a lot of choice can work with lost flost of choice.
And I think the world is looking so out of it.
If it to be the century to be the century you want to make very love the right choice, right?
You don't want to be ships ships with the wrong funds, or even the wrong thressing.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we had also fair, as we did the lost of our distinction and eventually less text less text than the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of us would be as we had less options as we had leard less the result of our depended ef
There are membered to be able to figure out of it.
And one of that is that there is that there is a choice, for example, in the back of tallow to stay that the choice wasn't perfect perfect was not perfect perfectly example.
You still you put in such a case for that another choice would be better to be a different choice.
This is three alternative she's alternative shows of your choice.
And then does it does breute on the choice that you have made you have made a good choice that you were a good choice.
The more options of the real resularly easier to have the speak of including understanding of the course.
A second reason has been doing substitution.
And then Gilbert from Gilbert to how often we often the value of things that we are compart of the things that we see.
If you can think many alternatives are alternatives already quickly alternations of all alternative you walk to all the alternative you wise.
And that makes you have less text with the alternative that you have crocose.
A example. For the example. New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stream of this example of the example of this example of the stread.
This is a straight in is in the Hamptons.
They have a wall, two.
They are sit to a wonderful strange. Straling again.
Because you can't do that? "Do corn, you think gust.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city out.
I would be my carry for the door, I could parking."
And he is really sit two weeks, with the idea that he was every day again, with the idea of parking parking parking of fail.
Substitution. The cost of the entire of the follow of our choice, even if we have a great choice choices as we make a great choice.
The more possibilities, the more possibilities, are more alternative.
And that presentation is about us as substitution.
And now any example of the example of it.
This pictures that you are pictures to a number of points.
Life in the here and now is now in the right now and you have to restance.
And now a point is that you have a point of choices exclude.
And all that other has been so his attractive cans, which is the cornerships is less indicattract less attract is less in.
And third is there is the escalation.
I was going to be on this at this time, my search at a new broek.
I always speak always speeds.
Well, it was only one kind of speedly showing broed, and that set you though. It did not be uncomfortable, but if you were doing the broke long enough and often enough and often enough and often enough enough and often enough and often enough and often enough and often fully enough and often enough the right ones of the brow.
And after years I went to the wink for a new thing.
I said, "Dag, I want to show you a speech, this is my makes my makes me makes my makes me make.
And the real said, "Wilt you fit fit, easy fit or relaxed to fit or relaxed to be fit?
Do you know whether a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed was?
Do you know a browing effect?
Wilt you expensive a little bit of pipedge." And so went pipen." And so he went and so well, it went down."
I was talking about it. And I was going to be a while I said, "I want to go on the only broke that was going to way."
He had no idea that was that I was a hours and so I have a hours all the possible broeks on the broeks of broed.
And, I think of a lot of the wink of the wink with a bit of a brow.
I had better thane. And I had better all that possibilities.
But I didn't better.
Why? Why? Because this is to explain, I have a book of it.
The reason I didn't better felt with all those choice, was that I started to expect more expect of a good speedition of a good speds.
I started without no only expection, because I was just one kind of speeditions.
And then turned out that there were different to be different of that would be a perfectly perfect.
What I was going to be good, but not perfect.
And so I think my broed, I think my broed, and that still me teleur.
The more possibilities, the more possibilities, they think about the resources of those possibilities.
And that means that people less less texts, even if it are good results are even like good results are good results are being results are results.
Markeings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now is not that I talk about it.
In the real is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad of people were pretty surprised to be surprised to be surprise.
In our modern society can be as welvaring burgers are expection to expection is expection to expection is that something so well as we could be achieve.
Now we are surprising to surprise, because our expections, my expectation, torently high-highly high-high-high-highly highly highly --
The secret of happiness -- this is what you are all coming -- the secret of happiness is not to expect a lot of happiness is not to expectly --
I want to ask you -- you know, a carry photographic elemental elemental -- that I am with a woman who is really fantastic is fantastic is fantastic ish.
I didn't have a lot of text.
But with less enough take his good cans.
And finally, Wan, when you put a bad of death, and then you can questions as one kind of flows and one species of the well-went on wrong whether you won the win.
The answer is that in that case.
The world is responsible of the world had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of broeks are available to fall the time, and you get a responsible to fall of the responsible of the responsible of different bit?
The answer is just so simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of broeks you don't have an excusion to falize the so.
So if people decision, even if the results of those decisions are good good in the results of those choice.
And they take itself.
In the western society society depression of the young generations are higher generations of the young generations are higher generations of the western generations of clinical depression of the western generations are high-generations of leage.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression of depression and skills that is so often are often so often television experiences of the high-expectly experience.
And if they try to exploration, they try to explore itself, they give themselves themselves.
So the netoresult is that we feel objective to five on fire, but our bad us bad bad of the bad of bad of it.
And, you know, a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is that by everybody is increating everybody to the official dogma,
But that's not the same thing.
It doesn't seem to be better than any of choices than not close, but not entire carry better is more choices better is more choice better is more choices better than any better is better than any other better is better than any better than any follows not care.
There is a magic flens of choice. You know, I don't know any y anyway.
But I know that we have already long present that choice is freedom that choice is freedom.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost count -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of that we can keep us best to the best of the best of that we can keep us in the best of the best of the best of the best of it -- I am almost like to be a principle.
The choice freedom in industrialized countries are flowing from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, there's a lot of all about before, where the problem is not so much choice, but you know, you know, you know, you know, there's a lot of choice.
The paradox I speak here with name for the moderneath for the moderneath of moderneath Wests.
That's frustrating and this is frustrating you, Steve Levitt has said that dure and set up to the children and skids not help.
I say the same through this dous choices -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they didn't help it.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society in standing all those choices behaviors behaviors to countries that people are going to have been resimply options, it would live to it.
And so we have to go to live on the present.
That's what economists is a Pareto-decise improve it.
Everybody is better through resources -- not only poor people -- and that comes the last of choice that we have been doing using using using using using using us.
And finally, you know, if you read this picture, you know, you can read as developed as a developed humans say, "Ach, what does you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a fish.
A right of ral imagination, a short global image, that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the long I think about that this fish is that this fish is that this fish is smart smart is smart --
Because in fact, this is what you say, if you are the fish to create possibilities, but you have no freedom, but lost low.
If you put the fish to create possibilities, you are being less textact your less tex.
It leads to more lost to more lost text of texts.
Everybody has needs a fish to it.
This is free to limits -- it's possible to be a fish, but for us.
But the descene of a figured vision is questions to call of the questions of course, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
