Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the pollish cap, that the last three million years, about the size of the polar cap, which was about 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States was currents.
But this distinction actually the most several problem because it is not the dicath of the ice.
The ice captured in the North Pole, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crace in summer.
The next slide, I shows is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanentire ice has been cleared in red.
As you can see, it takes it out of darker blue.
That's the year, that's the equires in the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years, or age, is almost like blood, is almost like blood, that skilled out there.
In 25 years is the gottten of this to this thing.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrate called the North sea very big amount of warming carbon cool there, when it is dead by microses in methane.
Containing the total of the amount of atmosphere, in the atmosphere, it could double double double if we were described the case of the case of the case of the privilege.

Whoo! Whoo! She is OK. The question is to be the real thing,
A reason for that, is that this huge warmtextbon," Greenland from the north of the north opwarms.
This is a smel-fater river.
The water than ever the water than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerly, right in South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because it is the landics are right because it is the place where it is in the sea place where it comes in the sea.
These streams are taking fly.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the South Pole, the biggest ice on Earth.
Last months month cure scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance balance balance balance balance balance.
More specifically is the ice in the West the South Pole very quickly fast fast is a couple of underwater islands.
The whole continent for six meters six feet of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass, there are new now there that were new now, that were a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world population is getting half of his drinking water of that smelt water of that smelt time.
In the Andes, this is the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappears disappears the drinking water.
In California was there a four-four percent in the snowpage of Sierra.
It comes in the water reserts in the water reserves.
And as you could read reads, the predictions are the predictions of it.

Four times more in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is fully impact intention.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton to CO2 to CO2 every 24 hours.
25 miles every day in our ocean, in our ocean, look at the eastern of Stille Each America, from America, from America, astants, and the Indian subcontinent, there's a drostic drifiction of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, is dewarming dewarming curving, which is designed for 20 percent fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stem is the most most of the problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest emers, to China.
And there was a lot of more urban couldn't build much more steel of building centers.
But we see a case of it.
These are the stem carbon that the building was annulected in the last few years and where green alternatives were proposed in the years, and where green alternatives were presented to be represented
There's a political battle on the country.
The step carbon and oil industig for 250 million dollars to promote a clean carbon to promote clean carbon clean cumulation.
And that image me to something.
And the chest was the chest cheish was at at at the home of four billion gallon gallon miles cool moded carbon cutter.
You probably have seen the news in the news.
This is the one-largest display in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

We have to go far fast.
Thank you.
Last year, I gave an introduced an introduced the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works machine works.
So here I am it. For those who didn't have the LHC is the most of the scientific experiment ever sums, 27 miles in the case of the case of the scientific experiment in the environment.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion than a billion second after the universe to 600 million times a second after 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLATLAS, Dtector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS, in building away you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLATLAS.
That was a care for a party of party in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle strel that all the way around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and detector in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we knew that picture photograph on 10 September we were working on the machine work, which is a huge overwhiin the machine work, which is a huge overhead.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest this, or then, then, then, when somebody went to Google and saw the Internet page.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden with these golden dies.
They were true to the tribes 13 thousand amper resources in full power.
The engineers are under you'll say, "Not where. They're too little wear."
They can do that because they superceive are in all temperature of temperaturs.
So at the miles in 271 degrees of space between the stars, who are wearing the stream between the stream of the stream better --
In one of the nein the Like thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructivate nets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was the wire of that, and there was a bit of electric weather stance that 13 thousand amper cheating 13 thousand amper chase of the 13 thousand amper called the 13 thousand amper ches.
This was the result.
This is more impressive if you realizing that those magnets more than 20 ton away 20 ton away and they were about 30 centimeters in the captup.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them all tools tool.
Now, they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will put it again, and we expect it for June or June or June in June or June so we can figure out what the building stribuilding the universe.
Now, of course, have the unhappiness of the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easily. It's easily. It's easily to research
I think it's so hard to be so difficult that it's so difficult that we are going to be further than the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I showed the defence of his learners' experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is the teachers of human mind to take the progressive mined the human beings of the human mind to take our images of the science, that there are no matter in the nature, and that our consections are not completely that our overover, and that we have been complearning that we are in the scienty discovered by definist definitiploce, and that there are no maticiplots of the times definities of the reames, and that we condn't make our rey best of the ready dicure of the ready dices of his thready experious of
Thank you!
I would like to start with you to ask to your children's time, when you play with blocks toy.
When you discovered how to understand how to figure out to the aware and conscious problems to learn by learning the side with and handing space relationships.
Rumultiply is strong because with the world to understand the world around us.
If an information inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advised objects -- and my fix called Jeee Pattion and my felt Jeee of Kalanithi -- I started asking -- what if we use a computer musicide of that one musicians that we can use with both of the engineering that resources we can figure out what information with both of the hands we can five hypes that information with both information that we can five hands hands hands hands ush information with boive ush information with boive fied with boive ush officiones of fied ush rigive use, which we can figt with boive hs of them with boi
and can orders orders can we want to be it?
This question to put us so decided to find a answer to search by Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftly a Sift-size computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be moving with the hand they can be moved to could, their movement and their movement and they detect a screen and wireless, and contact them contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical accutability, as blocks they can be moved by it.
And so Bovenered, Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulate of digital information.
Before this tools have a more physical different physical difference, aware of their movement and even of the way we move, and even of the way we move, there are different new and leutters of them, there are different new and letactions of them.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifth, in Sift is to show a video called video celebrating and others and others and otherwise,
These interactive portraits are conscious consciousness.
And in the end, in degree of place, they will interests.
If they get surrounded up this and can be able to be able to do this, and they can be able to certain sure.
Well, they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interesting of all of the interesting of the interesting of a color was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a fluid of the fluid --
In this example three Siftables away to get color and I can use them to use color in a lege to go into a lege where they get mixed together to be collected in a lege of the past three Siftables for the example of the piece of the example in this example of the resources three Siftables of the resources of
If we have dress the return, we put what back.
There are some clear cutty possibilities with languages with language, which is what people try to try and logics that we want to give people to try to try to try to see things fast.
Here I just -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a simple set programmatic programatic programatic programatic programatic programatic ship.
Here we show you a game between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single raround a letter letter on every Siftable, and vast in a dictionary dicumulated in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the results of the reshapes of a new series of letters with means in the capabilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm closed to make it out and make it try to make it out a video of making and make a video of making it.
They were really because they were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this is that people need to have instructions that people need nearly need to need instructions.
Everything you have to say "Make diction" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our young the last base of tester, right?
And it turns out he says the Siftable.
For him was just blockies.
Here is an interactive painting away in the show.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftill of the character of the character of the table.
Here he is going to come up with the sun of the sun of the sun
Video: The sun is coming.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene course.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done done that! Yeah!
By the shift of Siftables and the next to the characters can let the carager with each other, "Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open open end.
and he decisive how it the diry walks.
Video: The cates flies affold.
DM: The last example that I'll show today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent recent to the recent table, where every Siftables and drum.
Once of the variations, where you can choose the variations, where you can use it.
These sound in empty Siftables are being injected so you can determine the pattern its of themselves.
You place a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a lege Siftled live controllaborble effects as reverb and filter.
They are being a sound and added adapted by cancers.
Well, the general effects like tempo and volume that are passed on the whole pattern of the whole pattern.
Let's look at a look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a lead.
Now, I place the basline here.
Video: DM: I feed a feet of a feed-work on a little bit beat.
Video: DM: And now I buy the filter to the filter to the effect live in the effect live in the effect live in the effect live in the effect of the effect live in the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate it by the cancers of the tempo block.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter to the filter of the baas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repeak it while it plays.
So I don't have to planned everything to plann, but I can improvise, but I can improvise longer and make corter like I want.
With the dims of the dims of the volume Siftus.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new human making coming to make new human computer interfaces that have been voted better interfaces that are voted in the way our brain and work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design region this design area with some possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the touch to the touch is to take a whole generation with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much of heart.
I look at it to talk to you all with you.
I'm writing write.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm going to change all of writing and I don't think that will change that ever will change
And yet there is a recently recently has happened in my life and career and career with my relationship with my work.
It started with a book, that I written recently, a memoired memomoire, "Eten, Biddle in the transformation to my first work and a very international exist.
The consequence is that people now and always have to put the all over the case of the case I call the time.
World that -- you know, does the too.
People come to me and ask me to me and ask sure you to this success that you can never be able to evalone?
Do you don't get any afraid you will keep your whole life is writing but never publish to publish that people will be heaven, where people will be heavy for warm to write you?
Do you don't have frighten?"
To directly reason, you knows you.
Of course, that would be very much that I remember 20 years ago, I was when I told a teenager -- if I told write I wanted to be write for writing.
People said, "Don't afraid you have succcess you're never foot?
Don't afraid for dedication to it through it subject?
Don't you afraid you do your life to this work without that there ever comes out of this without and you will stronve your broken dreams on the public ax?"
Something in that strip in that strike.
In the short comes to the questions of this, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that are called the things that are called stuff that are called the things that are called the things that are called the things that are called the things that are called the things that are called called the things that are called the things that are called stuff that are called called the things that are called
Always the ways of it.
But I'm also much other things are bangling you doesn't know what for all of it.
For example, for example, and other end, and other only things.
But what write write is writing myself the last time that is from, where that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically someone is to be afraid to be afraid to be the work for the work for their opin?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the minds, something that is going to happen.
Take my father. He was a chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was ever ased in 40 years he has asked to be able to remember, or he didn't get away to be fright.
And so it said, "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, it didn't work about it.
To be fair fair fair engineers have been doing through the centuries have been crap to be piece of manician-depressive alcoholists.
Schriters well, that have this kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental entirely to be instable.
Look at the griming doty dottal under the most magnifical creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died young, often young, often by own own own own own own own own through own own own own own acts.
And even those who don't have suicide no suicide of the suicide of their gave buricate.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit of what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of inside we don't look more up.
We've heard it all before, and it was accepted it all accepted with the benefits.
The head thought is that creativity to be involved to be involved with suffering is to read an artist, finally indeed, an artist, in the end.
So I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask today: do you live with that idea liv?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it, I don't think about it, I don't find the whole thought.
I find it made sense.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like this this century is going to be so much to see this century.
We can sport creative sports much better to live in.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous life.
Sek the fase that my career in which my career now in my career now.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper reskty year.
I can may work four decade.
Havigast probably all that I'm going to get publish through the outside world as it followed on that extraordinary succcessfully succcessful.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can felt you probably clicens: highest success for me.
Jem, what a idea that an idea !
If you go think, if you go to you know the morning to the nein the morning to the nein the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me the work I love with the work I love with the work I love it.
The question is, "Hoom?"
And after long after long after long the conclusion I can only do by writing a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process inside the process of in.
I have to write a safe distance between minute between myself and my overty understand my overty understand the response to the reactions in my future publish for the response,
I was looking at the last year, for ways to ways to do.
I have down in history and have me floors in other civilizations to see if other civilizations to see if anybody better ways to help creative people to help creative with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest has brought me to the old Great the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let up because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Roman and Romein's believed people did not creativity comes from themselves.
Men beliefed that creativity was a diviety of a diviece, unknowledge place to the human beings came to the human unknowledge.
The Greeks called these spirit of creativity called "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had been influence.
The Roman had a kind of a kind of the kind of idea.
In fact, in the called the entirely creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Roman with a genius, is not a particularly piently person clear.
In their political entities was a kind of magic diviece of the artist, in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the pace was the geniusced to the geniusce.
And he gave shaped shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the earlier -- the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew what that was going to be in his work.
The artist, in protect for example of the narcism.
If you were working in the way, you got to be there.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible geniusible genius.
Word you work on the crows that not just you get to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather inhang genius.
Long time has been the long time in the West creativity was considered in the West
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything changed.
There was a whole new idea: the individual human beings is the means of the universe and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attended to the divile world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity was fully fully from the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history was in history was about artists that they were a geniused a genius, they did a genius.
I need to say that I have a big failed.
To one person, one person to make one individual individual human beings believe he or she's field the eternal mystery of the century mystery of everything did, creative and the familiar is -- that is to be a lot of responsibility for a fragy human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun in the sun in click.
Egos are blowing up to huge proportions and there are unimaginable, high experienced to prestions.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years, a lot of artists has made a lot of artists of artists
If that is, and that I think that is the question is the question: What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back the olders olders in the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can't do 500 years in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the 18 minutes of speech.
Probably there are in the audience people who read review of the idea that elfic double double dropping the idea that elfusing high creatures to inspire artists to inspire the work of artists to inspire
It seems not seems that I'll get you all get to get you all get there.
And yet I ask it up.
Why not?
Why should we have that thought that thought to next the thought of the mind?
The fast just soil as much shoot as all the other explanations of the total units of the total included that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something has trying to create something has -- so in fact, so in fact, so all the the creative process here -- you know that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational reason
That sometimes almost paranoral.
I have recently the great American case Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the case of Ruth Stone of the great American courage.
She is in the nined. Her whole life writes thing.
She told me about her youth on the country of Virginia.
Somes, if she was on the field was working on the field, she did them a poem country.
It was said to was, like there was a big wave air, as if there was a big wave air.
And a poem golfed golfed over the country to her it.
She felt that the flows under her feet and did that her feeling that her on that moment, but one thing to do to stand that her lives.
They ran home, back home, followed by the poem and showing and paper than the possible.
When the poem through her came was golves her only to write it.
Sometimes it was not fast enough.
Then ran and run, but the house is not the house is not the house
On the moments her high schools through her it, disappears -- in her words -- in her words -- to another close -- to another closer right -- to another closer in the closer close -- to another close -- to another close -- in the search -- in the words -- in the words -- in the fields, in the fields, in h
And there were one anything -- I find this -- I find the beautiful part of the story -- that she died the poem -- she almost mistic.
And then she was in the house looking for and paper and pieer, and lap, it was poem through her.
Juist at that potter had a penciled.
And with her other hand, so told me she pluck the poem out of the air.
She picked the poem with his tail, and put it back in her body, whereas she written the scribed of the scribed on the room.
In that cases the came came in the case came in the case of paper right now, but then in the case order.
When I heard that heard, I thought -- what I happened to be my creative process of creative process --
So my creative process is not work! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mileic, who every day on the same time, and standing the same time, sweates and with blood, sweates and trans with blood, sweating through time.
But even in that daily quarteries I had one one of experience.
You also know it will know itself that feeling that feeling that there creative ideas in your correlated to be able to identify from a source that you can identify identify in your impossible.
What is that sources for source?
How can we use the without we have become crazy?
On the way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musicians musicians
A couple years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life has been showed of the shows of the same through artists that tries to get all the power to get to the uncontinue to the uncontinue to the increative impults that are indivitable.
With the years, Tom was a little bit rough.
And one day he read in Los Angeles about the speaway, and changed the process and changed the process of radical.
And as he went there, he heard a fragmental crazy of a good celodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that fix foot is doing understand it.
It was a nice game and he wanted to hold the hold of the hold.
But it didn't wonder.
He didn't had a paper right now.
The amazing exciting exciting passed of him: "I touch the melody called me the melody of the ealth century.
I'm not good enough I can't ay."
He didn't refully in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something that is new thing.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the government?"
"Think I can really be a song of the write of the write of the write of this?
And if you really want this song is this, you have to clash it later, if I have time for you.
Now, you can't have someone else difficult thing.
Go near near Leonard Cohen." And from that point was walking very different.
The work itself is even the same, with the same dark of the dark subto.
But the heavy exciting that the creative process in him reflected him in the environment.
The genius was close to the skin and dished only the skin and did ond.
And I realized that there was no reason through to go through through this.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre cooperation between between Tom and the own diaspect that was not quite true at all, and it was not quite true from Tom ite to be a good at the time.
That story has changed my way of work.
I had already called a couple of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle in the writer's writing of Eten, Biddle in the writer's writing of Eten, Biddle in the writing of Eten, Biddle --
One a given point of time, I put in the despair.
You know that well, you don't want to get good work, and you don't want to make it a terrible disast. The book. The book.
Not just just horrible horrible bad bad.
I wanted to re-tool.
Then I remembered Tom that his genius, and I decided to be a power to way.
I wish from my manuscript and I directly a crime, and I was a learned of the room.
And I said hards: "Listen then, we know all of all the book, then it doesn't just come through me.
You can see that I have in the stop I have in the stop I have in me.
More I can't give it.
If you find that it have to do better your thing.
Do you can't imagine that, understanding you.
I just write down because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notults are avoid to figure out that simply on can't be the office on canop."
Tjage -- Unity, it comes up here, it's here,
Eures came back in the North African desert African desert people to dance in the sanlight to dance music.
Urs and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was great, because the dancers were full full --
But sometimes there are a very extraordinary extraordinary.
One of those dancers were transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean, you know, you also have something, you know, you also see something that you can see in a performer.
It was like the time still and the dance and the dance of step.
He didn't discover anything than the thousands of nights and now farl together.
And suddenly seemed to seeing a human beings.
In him, under him, under him, under him, under him.
A fired fired through fired him.
If something that happened, you knew people did what it was Dan they started clap, and in the case and called "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
because it was for them.
By the way, a nice, a nice historical fact -- when the Moren Spance Spance Spana convicient display them with them.
The question is realized by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, other."
That hear you hear today in the died in died and flamengodances.
If a pack in Spance something impossible or magically does human being: "Allah, old again, Allah, brow."
One of understand see: a glimpse of God.
Precipies what we need to need it.
Lastily is the dance of the following morning the discovered that he discovered on dinctions in the morning for 11 hours in the morning dised.
And at that point is that point a little older man with declash man with declass that may have never going to come to such the heights are going to come to be more of the height?
Maybe never going to have anybody God will never be anyone dance.
What to he now to the rest of his lives?
That's hard.
That's really difficult to squarter for a creative spirit for a creative spirit of a spirit of spirit to be a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to be a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to be a creati
But so painful is not need to be it doesn't have to be it.
Imagine you don't have any of your person exciting that the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of your person coming out of your person to be yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have a while, you know, let's reach a while,
When you are ready ready ready them, they give to someone else.
That's what it considered is everything.
I high incentives that thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book, that inside is going to different. The book, where many of reach is looking at the time.
The ught of that illuster progress.
If my mind with me on the hold with me on the off, I would keep the same thing that doesn't affor. Seither didn't stop any anyway.
Do just the work.
And just the reason your thing, whatever it is.
If you task you very task you for that, you know, dance.
If the dival genius, you have been decide to decide in your work at only one of the amazing sources by lying ying the amazing source, "Ol!"
Thank you that not, dance then, thance of thank you through it.
And then, "Ol!"
I believe hearts.
"Ol!" anyway, because we pure out of pure human love and ownervous and wisdom by still in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had the one of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that meaning, and what that means means of genes.
We start from a new point from a new point: we were the biology to the digitalization, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fash and synthetives.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is lives?" I think that have tried to understand in a different level in different levels in different levels.
We tried different approaches in different approach, the back to minimal components.
We're now the digitalizing for 20 years.
When we have sequenced the human genome sequence, it was the figure out of the biology world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, do we try to ask you: can we regenerate life is to create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can be multiply in a laboratory lasmular.
And we tried to look if we tried to a non-genome genome.
We can take the order of hundred genes from the 500 or 500 or anything that there are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relatively simple to the onness.
Gelebrite me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can provide per per per piece of this would be a lived cell of life.
We decided that the only route prevalue to synthetic this chromosome of synthetic so we could make the components to synthetic questions, to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions with questions like, "Can we have a chromosome synthetic synthetim?"
So the chemistry the chemistry of this very big molecules that we never have seen before?
And, if we do that, can start a chromosome """"""""""Sty?
And a chromosome is marry the way, but a piece of chemical ineral.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelerating on exponential way.
Our our ability to write the genetic coded write of writing, but is genome.
And our last point would be places at this exponential curve.
We're over here more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of step, start start with a bio-ethic tool cure of the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines DNA makes DNA make, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it more mistakes there.
So we had to have to take a new method for the together of these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes and corrators.
And this was our first pitate, start with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the foltcorrection --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting particles when we put a piece of chemical stopts, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria case of genetic code and make viral particles making and make viral particles
The viral particles were filled out of the cells, they came back after that, and deaths after that, and death the E.
I was uncenters in conversation with the oil industry, and I said them that model just too good fast.
They laughts more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software in which the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted something much bigger thing.
We wanted to build the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the full chromosome of the right mosome of the right mosome of the room is bu
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassetttes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could variance the cassettes of variety
to understand what the real is actually the real components of a livth cell cell are
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accurazy.
When we first first put this genome genome in 1995, the standard precision is one wrong 10,000 base.
And then we found the resequencing after 30 mistakes. When we had used the original sequence was used to start in the state sequence.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that have to be five letters to conduct 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they can design so they can design so they can design so that they can design so they can design together so that they can design in the design of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build 5
We designs here unique unique in this.
Maybe you read to you read the water market that we put water in stopping.
There's a certainly genetic code: A, C, G, G, G, G, and T.
Trios of those letters of code for roughly 20 aminoses -- that there is a long-to-currently clearning for any amino-source.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write,
And Avanced a signed of course, we just called "Well,
Some of them were disappointed that there were no poems were not poems
We have these pieces so designed that we can eive them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they put and in each other.
And we started making pieces of them and start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long and you have pieces of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters, to 72,000 letters to 72,000 letters to 700.
In any stedium we could cut a flow of these pieces so we could sequence, because we want to create a process because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will strake.
We try to reach the point of automated to reach automated
So this is looking out of a basketbal.
And once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate baseparate -- then they don't grow more in E.
That is the expensive of all modern tools of the modern of molecular biology.
So we went to raise with other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homold recombination" is called by the biology to repairs by the biology to repairs of DNA and that can feet can feet to fix and can feet
Here is one example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radio durans that three million radiodurance to radioffice.
And you see that in the top panel, she just shows the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chro
12 hours later later it was in the again, it was first such as the first first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely have been fully dried up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can find move, that can find for, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has marry the way, there's a lot of it, there's a lot of it, there.
Here's a real microphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually only yesterday with the right design of the pieces that we were down in the right design of the pieces that we were down in it.
And it is makes to make automatically conceived automatically conceive.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a common microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six of six seconds.
This is the publish that we track recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecule-went is more than 300 million of three million of three million.
If we should press it with a 10-point letter, without spired to the capture and then there's 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code.
Okay, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of we start?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria is the much complicated to it.
It's also simple, if you give under eukaryots, like we just knew the cell cell cell and there's another ine, and that's what you know if you can know if it clong.
In the bacteria of integrated in the cell of the cell but we have long the cel, but we showed a full transplantation of a chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome to activate of a cell to another, and it can activate.
We have a chromosome of the chromosome of the microbs of a microbs of a microber species.
These are about so far of each other, as people and mice and mice.
We add some extra gene so that we could select for this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the crope.
We have the tools to make enzyms to make all the protes of the proteins of the proteints.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very avanced graphic images here, in the cell images -- the new chromosome of the cel.
We even thought he would come to the process that he would come to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We figure out all kinds of these kinds of chromosome of chromosome of the third somewhere fun, they call of thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who have proposed evolution to imagine changes not much biology have been much biology took to be a lot of biology tood.
There are enzyms that are called DNA restriction enzyms that really fashion DNA field
The chromosome that was in the cell has not either.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop it in -- well, well,
It was expressed, and it was the other chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cell of the chromosome of the cell of the cell chromosome of the cell chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell that we had been cell of the cell
He was blue because he was stopped blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species, and he changed completely in the new species, and he was based on the new species, and software that we stopped in the cell that we had stopped in the cell right right in the new species,
All the proteins changes, the membrans changed the genetic codepended the genetic code.
This is a may as a genomical alchemist, but we're in standing the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change
Already have paid earlier that this is not creation -- this is not a creation billion years, and I have paid to 3.5 billion years, and I have paid that we may be almost a new version of the Cambrought of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the digital design.
Why would you do?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it needs to what it is.
We're going to take from six enome to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us that lived in 1946; within 40 years, that there are four are.
We have a difficult with food, with clean water, medicine water, billion billion.
That's being difficult to do that.
We use five billion ton colls, more than 30 billion dollars oil.
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we take biological processes in the momenic process than anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge.
Then of course, there is all the carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming already the carbon dioxide of the course of the course is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmote of the carbon dioxide of the course comes in the atmodel of the carbon dioxide of the tility coming
And though our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozen a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that come out there.
We are considered by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have technique fast synthesize this is what we called "combination genomics to do called "combination genomics."
We have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes of genes or optimize processes to optimize octan, or making medicines to produce octan, new vaccins, we can do with a little vaccines, we can do more molecular more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard standard selection.
We can select for life vatability, chemical or fire, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen, is a screen of what real design designs that we work on the global design and a new kind of the case of the computer and design.
We don't know what it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of their genetic code
We focus on the fourth generation fuels.
One of you have seen the bad to ethanol of the bad of experiment.
We have second generation and third generation fuel that will come inoff, like sugar, to more higer, to more higher fuel more higher fuel like octan, or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology without the food prize prize higher and the availability to make the availability to take the food supply with CO2 as food supplies that it is in that way, and we think that we can design the first food, and we think that the first foods in about 18 months of generation in about 18 months about 18 months of the being 18 months of the first months are about 18 months of the foods.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea of cool deep, in cooking it cooking temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water straight water resource.
We are looking at the way whether we can take cO2 to the fix through pipelled through to pipelled to pipelled this process, to stonly give this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to break that we are in stead of basic question: What is life?"
We have really know -- -- you know, the case of the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED in TED you can do this, what?
A important energy source is being a major
But we're also now we're also using these tools to think of these faster vaccines to think of these fast.
This year, there was the flu -- we walways just behind the facts of the facts in the right vaccin.
I think that can change by making text of teform vaccines.
Here you can see how the future is going to change the evolution tree is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerate of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eukaryota.
We are more removed from the improvement of people.
Our goal is to certain that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be a chance to do that.
What I want to show you is the fast is fundament of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we have to a fundament to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can local or in the distance of visual data can work on the dishes.
We look at this in many gigabyts, and can keep in digital images and can be in the case and the same to our wish, and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the room to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the big, the big of these collections or images are images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of this.
It all does not all of because the only thing that the prestations would influence, on a such of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of the data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Each cold is a head-piece of chapter.
To prove that it's actually text text is actually text a real, and we can do something that this is really text is to show that this is really a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an example.
Each big image is the beginning of a part.
This is really gives you the pleasure and the experience of a real papers magazine or capital scaling medium.
We also done something with the chase of the Guardian.
We have a nep adversished of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise -- and we have extra information information information information information information information -- and we have extra normade of a normade of advertisish resolution -- and we have extra nep of advertation information
If you want the opportunities of this car you want to see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limities of across the screen through the screen of accumble to do.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more means and other flaures -- not needle will be need.
Of course, of course, for the hand mapping for a technology like these, I will not spending a technology like this, I will spending this field that we can contribute to this field also much in this field image.
These are all the weaks in the U.S.
And the NASA picture of the NASA of the NASA --
Let's look at something different.
This is marry now live on the Web, you can look at the Web,
This project is called Photosynth, who connected to each other.
One is Sethrough the other is a very nice piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snavely, promove, at the University of Washington, increated by Steve Seitz on U.W.
and Rick Smyiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution to it.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision mes have algorithms have been controlling with the real room -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashws of stabilized diashws of panormages, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is a time there, other environments of time.
There are much space.
I want to do one of Noah's Noah's original data sets -- and this is a question of Photosynthesians -- to the communicate, to the communicate of the communicate of the enves of the environments of these technique, to look at the environments on our website.
We had to have to be able to put the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Day with images from Flickr. You just sweet, Noe Dely in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the push of the pickr.
And every of these orange rops in a picture that is part of this model of model of this model of model in this model of model in the part of this model of model in the pictures of this model of the basically picked out of this model of model of the model of this model in the model of the pictures give the image of the broimage of the pictures gives a part of this model of foot of basic.
And so all of Flickr pickr images that are basically breaks.
And we can simple in simple wise navigate crows.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would ever work at Microsoft in Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so received here.
I believe you can see that these many types are cameras are cameras -- everything from glex, a big number of this, a big number of this, in this environment.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much basically through faces and everybody like that.
Somewhere between this, even a series of pictures -- here's them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Delement Dedient is also good characters by the program.
If we dive it in a poster in a physically image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do things with the social environment. This used the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the whole of the whole of the whole of the Aarth -- and copels that everything to each other.
All these pictures are are going to be accounted and shapes a whole bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the earth of the earth of Earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of Earth of the entire Earth of the entire Earth of the entire Earth of the entire Earth of the whole Earth is
Sephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity, when it used to use the benefits grow for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being supply of metaphorrids.
When someone would want to clics and their names and their names and their names and their names, my photograph of the Notre Delement, and I can use it as an access to that space, and using it as an access to that space, used of anyone of the crums of crums of cross-modal, and create social experience.
And of course, is the means of this immense rich virtual fashion of every interesting place on Earth, who not only from the Aarth, who are not only from the satellites and other apply and other apply of the collective memory.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are deviolence on the world can get to the world by anybody on the world can get to the world together to get to the world to get to the world in the world in the world of the world that makes made of the made of the developed Chris Anderson: Do I can do the world thris Andersoftware Anderson: Day in the world?
BA: Yes. What this is really discovery.
The creates to your wish rise, hyperlinks between images.
And the base of the data in the images of the data in the images.
And that is designing when you think about the wealthy when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is information that defentire about this image.
When you look for the web and looks for images, you can figure out a search of the piece page in the Webpage is much information about what the image results of what the image results of the images of the images of the images, you can see a field information about what the images, and the text pictures, you can see a field ina piece of information about what the images of information in the pictures, and the web page of ina few bpage of ina lot of information about what the pictures, and then gives you can do is to be able to do is give to be able to be able to do to do is give of ina ft of ina search, and the p, and the p, and the p, and
What if now that is the image of your image is to all your imagination?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of the amount of rich wealth that comes out of that, and it's a classic. It's a classically networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and research of eating the possibility to live in between they're not forget to forget the old of the old wind, they are still feel in the wind, the polish stand, the profession broaders.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky galaxy is still to the Milky of Instead of the Instead of the Instead of the Americalaya bood-hystill boodhystill is still on the breathm of Dharma, you really don't have opening the world in which we live public opology in a absolute sense, but is not a bsolute of the world in model of the world in a company model of the world that we have been world in the world in model of the world, but in the sentive of the boomyth,
the consequence of a vallight set of choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all shared the same types of the same truth: Worth born kids in the world.
We all make indeeply indeed.
Because with the individed separation by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all have done and art art and art art and art and art and art them.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the World of Bornews in the Voo-Art in Haiti, or the freedoms in the Kaisut-batch in North Kaisut-based in the Andes-basically in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- -- this is the man with the whole of the maths of the hells of the hells of Qomolangant ma,
Everest, the god-mother of the world.
They all learning us all that we can be different, differently, differently, our ootherwise can orient on Earth.
If you think about it, you can only give you hope all of this.
And together shapes the intelable cultures in the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her as important as the biological life-web -- the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine your eating as a eating fool.
The ease fact you can defining the finish of all the thoughts, dreams, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas that are inspirations that are continue through the human imagination that are involved by the human imagination is consciousness.
The cition is the great nalatency of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are, and we can be astonishing the curious species.
like the biosphere is obvious offer is the eath face that is -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take half that minds all kinds of extinction of all the kinds of extinct because that's simply not true.
And the most apocalyptic scenario is not even come in the neighborhoods don't even come in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this.
Then everybody here was born born born there was sixth of sixth trying to speak on Earth --
A language is more than the words, or her grammatical rules.
A language is a couple of human soul.
It's the view of the soul of culture that the soul of culture the material world reach.
Every language is an age spiritual mind, a disruption, a disruption, a piece of spiritual possibility.
From that sixth thousand languages today the half of that is not more kids in children are flistening in children's organized in the children's eyes.
They are not longer longer to be a longer for it.
Effective means that it is a change operating operating a change that they're dead.
Is there something that is to be able to be the case of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, no opportunity to have no opportunity to have a chance, no ancestors of the kids of the kids of the children test?
And priate that terrifies are somebody's benared every two weeks in somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks die, because every two weeks die, the last letter-dies of an old language of an old language --
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't have better place if we all are the same language of the same language of you that same time? I say, "Super, let's take Kantonees.
Or Kogi." you will realize the way to speak to speak your own language.
So what I really want to do is take you today is to take you on a short journey by the eating of what is going to be a picture of what is going to be lost in fact,
Many of us forget that when I'm talking about another ways of around "another way," also I really means different ways means --
Take this Barasana child in the North Amazon the North west-Amazon the anaconda, that believes the anaconda, that believes the melk of the anacross cryere, in the brain, in the past of sacred skilled snes.
This is a people, cognitive the colors blue and not distinct, because it wonderful, because it wonderfully to the heavy of the same state of the oerwer to the dependent of it.
They have a currental curve, which is called linguistic examy is called you to someone called you to someone called someone called you to someone called a different language in the other language of the count.
This has roots roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary foots in their houses, where six or seven talks to be so, by these crufies, but you never have someone heart to be someone heart.
They simply simply and start speaking and start speaking.
And one of the fascinating tribes that I have lived with the Waorani in North Ecuador, a north of north Ecuador, a police of which was contact in 1958 contactact was contact.
In 195, five missionariss contact five missionaries, but they made a critical mistake.
And the sky pictures of pictures of themselves from the friendly friendly built that this is never a two-dimensional image image.
They were pictures on the face and tried the form behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face of the pictures and tried the face of the face behind the face of the face behind.
When they found nothing that they found the dividual they'd concluded them through thously the missionaries, with spearly muscle.
But the Waorani didn't just outside outside of the outside of the other.
Fift-fift-five came out of their mortalities.
We could generalogies could be realogies to eight generations back to eight generations from a natural death of a natural death of a natural death generations.

It's a picture I am you. I mean, in the North Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive reaches from the repertoire of the shaman.

I was trying to try my professor, Richard Evan Shtes, to convince the psychedge in Mexploring the psychedge of paddos in Mexico in the '30s.
I painted that these tryptamines didn't identify identify as hallucinated to experience, because when the effect is intreated to experience. Tryptamination. Tryptamines are not oral orgate, because they are not to take their effect. And they designed by enzym in the human dark of the human daround in the human daround in the human dark of the human daround in the human darraamini.
They can only be oral oral to be enomes with something that the monoamine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the sample of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the same of the monoamine of the same of the same of the same is doing of the monoamine of the same is just oral oral organal to be dealt oral with something that the monoamine of the same of the same of the monooral of the same of the monooral that the same of the may of the matectrifects.
The fascinating is that the better carbolines in the limboline-suppressure of the basically suppressurs are to activate the tryptance.

The truth is that the 20th century is not remembered to be remembered to be his wars or technological innovations, but earlier in the worth century that we stood at it, and active participating in the mass destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem doesn't change.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the questions that I decided to recently.
Maybe you see parallels to the information from other sources.
I think about a little bit of connected to explained that you may have mistry.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized together of all western together.
And that official dogma dogma as follows follows on the highest level of our curgers on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level freedom of individual freedom freedom.
Freedom is a good good, an essential part of the human exist.
And then freedom freedom is freedom to account to accumulate a higher wonderful speaker wwhether without of third without inside of third without human beings.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wonderful wonder.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take anybody would take to during in our does during in our does have been driving in our does become a deep of the nobody would be during in our society that nobody would take a deep of the together would be during in our society
And in our lives is this dogma field.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermart. It's a means of mean.
And then about three of three
In that 175 can-simply three virgins there are 175 various extra-virgin my supermarket virgints and developing a different balsos in the past of the barrage.
And you can make a number of the own ddressings own drive between those 175 species for you.
So that's the privilege of my supermart.
Look at electronics in electronics, you can stroneoset of strettled speakers, cassettespecier, cassettal miles.
And in that one electronics you can choose out of this couple of language.
You can six-half million different systems collaborating systems with the sharing of that store.
Give towards -- then you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young the long time ago, you could all call erkinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You wouldn't hold it it. You didn't take it.
That had the front of the advantage that it was never piece of the benefit of it.
That time is in the time.
Today there are a lot of different state stribute a lot of different state
And especially in cell phones is the diversity is immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mid-player, nose game to the critical lettop-critical critical letter.
Wellight has been seen this model in the store, but you can certain of that happens is that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer to the question that question that question that question that question that question to the question to the question that question that question to the question that question that question to the question that question that question that question that question of the question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a possibility that doesn't do much
And in aspects of life that are more important than the point of spulling, is this explosive increase of choices of choices is a fet.
States -- it's in the United States in the United States in the United States you go to the doctor and tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and then, "We can do And, we can do that.
As has this front and craftly triple of this front and cutes.
And the other thing has this front and nadels. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, what is do?"
And the doctor says, "An this front and naves, and the naves, and nadels.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dutter, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm you."
And we call that we call "own increase the patients."
That sound very positive, but means means that the sware task of decision of decision of someone with increase -- the doctor -- to a free certain skes -- the patiently and not the best condition to take decisions. The patient. For on recept of recept means -- the patient.
Good considered that ners, because the purpose, because the pur, you can't buy buy it.
Why do we make recoral makes if we can't buy it?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctor to ask our doctor to ask to ask that other brand medicine.
Our identity, yet a engineering aspect of our existence, is now the path of choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identity state our background in territor.
We find ourselves -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every morning to the open to stand you have to think of what for person you want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that free everybody else everybody was going to be the fastly because you can be possible to children and started to kids and start to children and start.
The only real choice was with why and what you did doesn't when and what you did did.
Now, freedom all for the opens for the opening.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I would be 20 percent less house work at less called up and then asked up and then asked in the case of the course.
They are not dom, the head than in the ways of the time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Well, I say, whether I say, well, though I say, "Well, I now?
Or I will wait? Take a first children, or a career or a career rene?"
These are all soils are all over the questions.
They are going to have a answer answer in the answer that means they don't get all their housework and therefore through no good circulator.
And they have right. They're important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just gave that technology is to work minute every minute of every minute every minute -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a marry place, which WiFi it does. WiFi it does.
I don't ru, because I don't want to ru, because I want to keep the place for me.
But anyway, that enormous choice of work like we won't work on the moment, whether we're going to work on times on time, whether we're working on the right not.
We can look at a football dwood bat, with our cell phone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all out of standing, do we all experienced every minute of that competition with all kinds of question: "Well, I answer?
Well, I can go on this emailt respons? Stype of this letter letter of the letter of the letter respon?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience, we experience.
Where we look at look, the big, the small, the little materialistic bags, lifestyle: lifestyle.
So the world used the world used to be there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of chooses.
And so the world is now the world now out.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad.
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what good is good on is, so I'm good, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it.
That enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very opposed to be a very basically effect is working than basically basically breaking.
With so much choices opportunities are going to find a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of the investigate of investigations in free of investigures.
A colleaguary was access to investment data of pance of Vanguard, a big political political society with about 2,000 feet of the 2,000 vestments.
And she found that for every 10 decades that work the political boxes that work gever the same two percent decorporate.
In fifty funded 10 percent less works, less than five fundress fundress fund. Why?
Because it in fifty funds, so difficult to choose that people just choice the choice right to the next day, and that open, and so on.
And from the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of comes from outside.
That means not only that people after their pensioner did not just dood, because they didn't have enough money because they didn't have enough money in the picture that they were working in the working together for the work of them for display.
And they went with that, they walked to 5,000 dollars a year,
The worker was called the worker was pretty to double.
So the basically work can work a lot of choice.
And I think the world through it looks like this.
If it goes the eternity, you want to make very love to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be seated up with the wrong with the wrong funds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the paralyzing of our dished and choose the lamics, finally less tevilless tevily the result of the result of the result of the result of if we had had had had been less options
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example of the choice, affect can keep the choice didn't perfect perfect.
You put you in such a case, for that another choice would have been better in that another choice.
This dried alternative alternative alternative to your choice.
And the choice does the following of the choice that you made the choice that you made a good choice.
The more options there are more options, the more option. It's easier to have been spired of ungetting the piece of the gechose option.
Second reason has to do substitutives.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorrow from morning about how much things that we depend the value of things that we can get them.
If you can think of many alternatives you can think quickly quickly quickly can see the attractives of all alternatives that you dest.
That makes you have less tevilized the alternative that you chose have chose to you've chose it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is one of this example of the stretty of this example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second live.
They are on a beautiful, and they are now. No human beings in them.
Beause in the rooms doesn't think that man, "It's augggood," it's augggan.
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is outside.
I could flash my car for the door."
And he is too simply simmply with the idea that he was that he wonderful every day parking a great parking place.
Substitutives are going to be cost of the entire we have of our choices of choices that we have a great choice.
The more possibilities are more opportunities there.
And that presenting us as substitutives.
Another example.
This pictured pictures to a number of points.
Life in the here and now you have to hold things you don't have to continue thing.
And one point is that you have to exceevery choices of choices of choices
And all that other has been so his attractive option to the chose option is less attractives.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with my quest at my quest to a new bask.
I always took almost always speak to the broke.
And the only thing was only one kind of speech, and it bought your dance. It was not incredibly ununbelievable, it was incredibly unch long enough and the brown enough and the brows of the OK.
After years, I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That's my means broek, this is my meet.
And the story said, "Wilt you figure fit, easy fit easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit easy or relaxed fit easy figure out of the reinon.
Do you know if a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed weshed or acid-washed?
Do you have a break with snamed sub-effect?
You know, you know, went to a little bit expended pipels air." And so he was so went down." And so he was just through this.
I was speakes of it. After a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to the only brow.
He didn't had any any any any any any a long time all the possible brows pass.
And actually, I left the store, I left the store of the browning browing brow.
I had been doing it better done it better capabilities I could do it.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To explaining myself out of this book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of this choice freedom, I started to expect more of the smelless of a good speaking more of good speek.
I started without any expectation, because I was only known.
And then turned out there were different and one of that would be able perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my brow my brow expectation, and that standing me television.
The more opportunities have more opportunities of the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means are that people are less tevilious results, even if the good results are good results are.
Marketings don't know.
because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In really the about it.
Everything was better when everything was better in the course.
because when everything was bad all of the bad was bad people have experiences.
In our modern society can be expected as a curviors of course, but the best thing we can achieve ever expect in the case we had been expected as good as we had been expected to be expected as well we had been expected to be expected as we have to
Never we are surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torent, torrown.
The secret of happiness -- this is not to be much of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much to expect it.
I want to stand -- I want to stand -- a carefully elemental elemental -- that I am with a woman who really female is with a fantastic basically is.
I didn't have me with her with less text with less text.
But with less enough his good can't have his good sides.
And finally, finally, when you get a bad bad of bad speaking a bad bad as one kind of being one kind of front is one kind of advantage you to ask why you impact why you are intesting.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible ase. You had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brows are available to fall the black to fall the black to fall the time, who is responsible in the curvator?
The answer to that, is just simple thing. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break you have no excuus to fail.
So if people decisive decision of those decision of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves quality.
In the Western together clinical depression under the younger generations are high time.
A factor -- not the one, but a significant factor in this explosive towards this explosion of depression and suicide is that people have very much television of the depresent experiences.
And if they try to explaining the country to explaining themselves the decorporate of themselves the deced.
So the ntoresulate is that we are objective on the bad of good field -- but our bad bad of this.
And anything for a continution.
This is the official dogma, that everybody for everybody to be touch.
But that's not the thing.
It isn't doubt a choose that can choose better than not choose to choose better than automatically that is more choices more choices in choices is better choices are better than that.
There's a magic boundary of choice possibilities. I don't know it.
But I know that we have for for for a long time, that choice is freedom for the choice freedom is conducive for the being conducive for the choice of choice for the choice of the choice freedom for a long time.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing we can keep us the best of the best thing we can keep the best of the best thing we can keep us the best to be the best to be the best to be the best to be the best to be the best to be the best to keep the best thing to keep us
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overfish from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard over the problem is not too much choices that there is a lot of choice there's a lot of choice.
So the paradox I discuss here with the navailim for the modern, wonderful West.
That's frustrated and and said this, Steve Levitt has told to say that expensive and difficult to installing children's children's did not help.
I say the same thing about this diver, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help the same thing. They didn't help the same thing.
They make our lives fewer value.

But the display of a figures senky is asking for curving, really, unity, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
