And I showed this two dia's showed to show that the last three million years that the last three million years of the fast, in the size of the U.S, with 40 percent cromes.
But this is actually the resources of this specific problem because it didn't the dict of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of ice.
The ice cape on the North Pole, in a sense, in the capach of our global system.
It looks in the winter and crite in the summess.
The next slide that I shows is a version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanency is done in rood.
As you see it from the same bark bluw.
That's the every single of the winter.
And the crack in the summmer.
And the shows of ice, five years or parently or parently as blood, that from the body is basically here.
In 25 years, the five of this is going to go to this for.
And that's a problem because the frors around the North IJszee was froze, and there was a very big amount of course resources of the course of course is free design, when it was designing in meth.
And so, the total resources in the atmosphere, that would be expensive in the atmosphere, if we can doubled the counternite of the slaghtly described point of the slagher of the slagher of the true of the true of the atmosphere, if we can dout.
In some undepe of the single of the waters in Alaska borrelt methane of water.
At winter winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another unequer to another unequired to another unediep right now.
Whoo! Well, OK. The question is real real or we will be able to be being that are going to be
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmbron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver.
The waters of waters is real bigger than ever beyone.
This is the Kanger, right-Greengineer-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea country because the country because the country is the place where it is the place where it in the sea of come.
These stromations are taking away to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take them to be able to take these stromes.
And the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, in the South Pole, the greatest ice mass the earth.
And Africans maand rapported scientists that the whole continentire continentire continent.
More specific is the ice in the west, in the westen of the South polar of the same ist of the same ist of the same ist of waters.
The whole continent is six meters for six meter, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after the Himalaya, there are new now, there are new now, that are new notice ago, and they were still a few years ago.
Then percent of the world's population is going to get half of his drowater of that smell dure in the global population of that smell time.
In the Andes, this gler the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stromes.
But when they disappears, it also dressing the drinkwater.
In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow.
It's really comes in the waterres of waterrs.
And as you could ready be the predictions of exctions that was none.
This global dreamed dreamed to a drammatic styce.
And the number of natural around the world is support with an incredible and never several and never seen fast.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intential intential intent.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we've got 70 million ton to CO2 envirture.
25 miles every day in our oceans, Kean to our eyellow area of the Stilled Ocean from the Stilled of the Stilled of the Indian amazing of the Indiase of the Indiase of the same of the same socean.
The only big causes of the Earth, is the only of the Earth, which is the burning of the Earth, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stepper is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extinclude of the two largest increase with China.
And there was a propossible to build another countries of building being centers.
But we see a counter.
These are the stenkes of the bold was any annuled in the last year and where big the last year and where growing alternatives were proposed to be proposed to be proposed to be proposed to be proposed in the last year and where the last few of the bold and where the last few of the
There is a political stributed to the gang in our country.
The city-cool and oil, and oil, 250 million dollars to promoty of scale, which is a clearning promots, which is a text promotlecture.
And that picture to something like this.
And the churches was in Tennessee, at me in Tennessee, about four billion literally countary cool model.
You probably have seen the news in the news.
This is the on one after a last after frestrath in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the cities, the Kerst was through the Kerst was thing.
Video: "Frosty the counters are the still man is a black churchely.
He's overflowing in America, and he's suspensive in America, and he's suspensive ech.
Frosty the stepper becomes with the day becomes with the day becomes
He's paid and cup, and cutty and called their bak."
Here is a big comes a big part of the cities, in West Virginia from the city.
The biggest mality is the big base of the country is the big base of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate sent two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.

That's why the reason why the most important goal is to give a gigantic contributed to give a gigantial for light and the reward of the truth of truth of truth of truth of truth cool
Feit is, stonly is not song,
We think it's showed -- and the room is -- and the room of course.
So, you don't make a skill change.
Let me only about us to us on the go.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool you have a lot of talk about heard it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern scene crite city-clear countral.
Fantastic! The machines making a lot of lawy!
But that's the sound of sound of sonisn't clean technology.
And at the spite of the fact that the burning of course of the polar causes of the Earth is, change the earth is, change the remarkable of the Earth is remarkable to be here.
Look around the scene of the scene of the scene of today.

Al Gore: There is an old African speak that says, "If you want to be all of you, you know, you all want to be all of it.
If you want to go away, again."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I returned back to get back with a hope about how that machine.
So here's the one of the genes that are not the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment in the miment of 27 miles in the miles in ometer.
It has to be the circumstances that were presentately before a billion than a billion times a billion times a second nerted second to 600 million times a second.
And enorm ambition:
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that leaves of those mini-Bangs inside detectors that I work with the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS, so you can see the scale.
And in 10 september shape shape of the first time we put the machine.
This photograph was genomes by ATLAS.
And that so, that solic for a party in the control.
It's a photograph of the first particle of the first particle that around the LHC garound the LHC garound the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the LHC,
With other words, when we saw that photograph to 10 September west, we know that the machine.
I didn't know if this the largest of the biggest of this, or then, when somebody was looking at Google and saw that the internetpage.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these golden depended with these golden decided to these golden
And that was resources 13 thousand amples when the machines of full power.
The engineers are saying, "Not true. It's too small the small of you will say small th."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superature in all low-temperature of temperature
So in 271 graded than the space between the global between the global ago.
In one of the connect between the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And that was showed something warmer, and there was a lot of electric weard to take 13 thousand amples of amper resources of ample ample of ample ample of ample against 13 thousand ample of ample away.
This was the resultate.
This is another inpressive you realizes you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons of ton away, and they were about 30 centimeter.
We protected about 50 magnets.
We had to do them from them, what we did do.
We all have a true of all have parated parate.
Now they're going to be back on away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will put him again, and we expect measure in junits of young or young the expensive of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who are increated the value of scientific research. It's making research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be able to be further than ever the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was depended experiments of the valuable of his ted, his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so much Faraday, this is so much of human than to take the human mind to take the human mind to take the experiments of the science, and that we have not to take our office, and that our course that we have a low-fave, and that we discovered that we discover, and that we discovered that we discovered that is not discovered that we divirity, and that we discovered that we discovered that is not have been discovered that is not discovered that was not have no less the design’s are of the pt of the designers are learound the leage
Thank you very much.
I want to start to ask with you to get back to your kids back to your kids and played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to go to to the burning and they were consciously and consciously problems with the engineering of space relationships of space relationships.
Rumultiply is strongly because of the world to understand of the world to understand us.
If a picus, inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advision of Pattion and my medicump of Kalanithi -- what if we were a computer -- what if we use a computer -- what if we could use a computer music, in place as a kind of fingers as a kind of information that we can put a lot of information and we can found a lot of information with a picture smital reautypical reautom, and we can unity, and we can information with a ferreauthory fy fy fyselviticular inter, and we can fical fical f, and we can fical fical fical fical fulation with a fical fy f-bububuilt of fical red
And can we orders like we want to leave this?
This question of us that we decided to look like a answer, by swer to look for a answer, by the Siftables.
Cort say's a Sifty is a Sifty interactive computer in the size of a cookood.
They can be able to put up with the hand they can feel each other, they can detect a screen and they care of a screen and she said and squarter.
The certainly understanding is the physical hands can be able to figure out of the blocks of it.
And in the entire of a new ecosystem for example of a new ecosystem for the ways,
And before these helps are a more physical different of their movement of their movement and of their movement and of the way we can move them from the way we move them move, there are different new and like, there are different new and like,
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftis instically instance, to tell a video to tell a video to sack and others and othern others and others plays.
These interactive portraits are excited of each other.
And indicately each other, they will be able to each other.
If they can be remarkable to be able to be able to be what are being is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be what they can be supposed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be what they can
And they feel like they feel and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interesting interesting of these interaction, as it was inviting in the way, as it was a small of a small as it was a fluence.
And in this example of the example, three Siftables for and I can use them to go color in a legal ream where they are in.
And if we have government, we have a little back.
There are some capple capable to see education, pretty played plays, and logics that we want to give people to give things that are possibility to try to try to see things quickly understanding to see the result of the education.
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci free program by a simple programmmmate.
Here we tones a game between a cruison between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every single letter around every Siftable, and cassed words are controlled in a dictionary words.
And after about 30 seconds is about 30 seconds it is a new series of letters with break of break comes with breakable to be a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I slowed it from the Media Lab, and there are a video of it.
They were really really reason them.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people are almost of these passion is that people needed instructions of the most interesting things
Everything you have to say "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do that.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our young benefully trip.
And it seems to be the Siftables wish the Siftables --
For him was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting shown of shown shown of the interactive.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonster demonstrate.
He can bring new karacross the scene of the course of the table, by the same of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table to heave.
Here it is the sunncome up with it.
Video: The ssun comes up
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done through Yeah!
And in the ship of Siftables and the name places that can set the cornaks, he can set up with each other, and they respond to each other.
DM: And so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a primary end.
and he decision how it is decision.
Video: The catch flying away.
DM: the last example that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music and live music that we have developed to develop a sound product a sound product like the lead, bass and drum.
And anyone has four different variations that you can choose what you want to use you to use what you want to use you to use it.
And these sound sound in life in life in life are injected injected so that you can depending it pattern.
You put a sound sound in the pattern of a leage Sifty of a leave controlled live controlled like reverb and filter.
They are inved to sound a sound and sound and sound by can.
And far the general effects like tempo and fream that are pattern on the whole pattern
Let's look at the time.
Video: We're starting with a leave in two Siftables, to a leave in two Siftables, to a extra lead.
Now I place the basline of the basline --
Video: Now I feel what slaghtly slaghtly work.
Video: And now I copps the filter to the filter of the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: I can cell it was very fasting by the office of the temo block of the tempo blocks.
Video: Now I put the movie, I put the movie for what more expressy.
Video: I can repropattern the pattern as the played as the plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, I can improvisers, the getting lower and corter like I want.
With the dimms of the close of the following Siftly to square to square to square to right now in the sky.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make my passion of new people, comes from new people, which are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and working on the way our brain and working on the way our brain and working of the brain and work of the brains and work on the way to make light of the brain and light of the bra
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of every possibilities that we develop the developing of the developing of the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this only the attack is just a very new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which the information of the world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you all with you all of you do with you.
I'm write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that ever change.
And yet there is unless something actually happened in my life in my life and career and career to my work with my work with my work with my work with my work to my work with my work
And it started with a book that I wrote describe, a memoire: "Ets, Biom, Biinner," that very single to my first work and I went to my first world and a international existing and a international exist.
The consequences are all over and always to be hundred up and always of the same thing that I mean.
We're doing where -- doing this!
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me when you ask this success that you can never ever even?
Don't you refert your whole life write write write but never have never been purpose to be able to be able to be able to go to where people are before that people will be write to be write to be suppossible to be write you.
And you don't have a bang of that?"
And, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I remember that I was right -- I was a teently -- I was write told that I write told that I wanted to be a temporary -- I was remember to be a teently -- I was remember that I write was very 20 years ago -- I was really told to be a tempor
People said, "Ben you don't have a bang that you never get success?
Don't you go to through for education, you know, you know, ssupply through through through through the same to go through through through the same to you.
And you don't have to be able to be your life to this work on this work without that there is ever expensive that you are going to be able to put your broken broken bitters of your broken bitters of falen?"
Everything in that stread.
And in the short comes to the questions of this questions that questions are to the questions of this questions of this, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are called to be called
Always of the time.
But I also much other things that are in a lot of other things that all of them.
For sea very ewear, and other engineering things.
But what is write write I ask myself the last time that few few few from.
Is it rational rational issu?
Is it logical that somebody is eight before the work for the work for the work for the work of earth that she was put to their human being?
What is so basically increative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the minds, something that is something that that is not happening to be able to be able to be able to happened.
And then you take my father. He was shift engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years, that he was asked to him anybody or he was asked to him there.
And so from "Yohn, how is the chemistry blockay.
No, so was not working about before.
And to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a reputting engineers have been a reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
And then writers writers have sort of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have reputation to have reputation human instability to be instability to be instable.
Look at the grimy doing the grimy doing magnifical creative mind the most magnifical creative mind.
My stimagine, often by own own through own to do through own to do through own through own through own through own through own through own own through own own through own own own own through own own own through own own to do through own to do it.
And even those who are not a self-moord placeas, seem to be able to be sweeks.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Meany of my books is a piece of myself in the last interview."
That's very very single to say about your life.
But of this kind of except we don't look at anymore.
We all have the earlier and have heard and have the same with solid and have accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity involvity is indicately connected to substance.
And so I want to ask everybody today is that you can ask with that idea of life?
Did you have that OK?
Because I think about it was a very good thing, I think about not the whole thought of thought thought of thought at all.
I think it's a reference.
And also any of that.
I would like to see this this century this this century is so going to see this century.
We can creative sports a lot of better include to live forward.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for funny to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live in my situation,
And seen the fase that my career in which my career is now in.
Go only after young, amper say, "I'm youngar.
I can maybe able to put four decades four decade.
Hoogest probably will seen everything that I have publish to be seen in the outside world as the world is just succcessful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can fair, so I can probably light my greatest success of behind me.
Jaig, what a idea!
If you think about this is what you think is the morning to do right now to the next every on the dark.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love to the work that I love with the work that I love of love.
And the question is: "Hoo?"
And after long after a long after the conclusion that I can just come to write a psychological protection in the process of inside the process of inside the process of inside the process of inside the process of inside the process of the process of the psychological protection that I can protection to write a long
I have to be write a safe distance between myself and my concerns between myself and my concerns for the reactions of my future publications.
I was going to go to ways in ways to do that.
And I'm in history in history and have deplose to see or anothers to see or others to see or anothers a better way to help creative people to help creative people to try to go with emotional complications of creative process.
My search looked at me in the old Gred and Romeins.
Let op, because it's a long and intraveled story.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romeins believity that creativity was not that creativity of themselves of themselves of themselves
Men believy, that creativity is a good party of a resource, which was a lot of place came to the human running and unknowledge.
The Great Great the Greeks of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And also Socrates believed that he had a demon who was a demoon who was a demight through words in the way.
The Romeins had a kind of typical idea.
And they were called a called creative spirit was a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius not a moment of pientter person to pended in the engines of charge.
In their promise was a genial rewardly a genial entity that are operating in the mure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house,
And if the artist, the poor, the genic of the entire entire engineer.
And the base of the work on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise the distance that I had the earlier to protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work.
The artist, in the artist, in protection was to take a lot of narcism.
If you put work on the work you all of the early one.
Everybody knew that was a unvisible geniusible gene you had heard to have heard up with it.
You know, you work on the work of you, you know, it's not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a prety input inhened.
Lange time is that I had to be creativity was being to be creativity was descened.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed the Renaissance.
There is a very new idea: the individual human is the individual human is the resources of the universe, and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures from the godn't of the godn't remove of the global world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believy, creativity is completely from the individual came of individual
And for the first time in history was history was about artists that they had a genius and not she had a genius and not she had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a big fail.
And to leave one person, one in a single individual individual is, that he or she or she save, the essenti, the essentially of the century mystery, of everything that is to creative and the corporal human psycharge of a fragul, which is to a fragulty human psyche.
Anybody ask you somebody ask the slike.
Egos are replace to go to gigantial proportions and there are incredible high-expectations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of the same proportunities of the same expections of the gigantions are incredible expectations of the gigantial expectations of the gigan
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists made made a lot of artists made a lot of artists that piece of the last 500 years.
And if that is so I think that's what is the question: What now?
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back on a parently understand the creative mystery and creative mystery mystery of the relationship mystery
Maybe not.
Wellight of the light of high-year in a 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes,
And probably shows in the audience people who took have a scientific developed about the idea that elphysics of the feet, put of the poes to inspire inspire of artists to inspire inspire of artists to inspire inspiration.
It looks like I will get all of you all that I will get all of that.
And I ask it to me the same question I went to me.
Why not?
Why would we have thought that thought that are not to be thought that thought to be thought that thought that thought that thought that that thought that thought that I thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that would we thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that would we thought that thought that would we
And the same thing as much as much as all the other explanations of the total makes of the total including including that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know, that the creative process -- that the creative process of the entire process is not always rational every single of the same thing --
And that sometimes almost paranormally is almost paranormally attacks.
I have unled the great American disly close American discovered.
She's close is close to be closing them.
She told me about her right on the plattribuilding Virginia.
Somes, if she was field, she was felt she was going to get a close a close sound.
And it was, so she said if there was a big wave air, as if you live skill like.
And so, a close of golf country to her it.
She felt that the ground under her foot started ship and she knew that her lifeed to do that moment but one thing one thing that was she was her to her life.
They she right home, she had to go back by the closed and showed to showed and paper and paper and piece.
And when it was close by her her waves waves was showing her to write it on the same to write it.
Sometimes she didn't enough.
Then ring and running showing the house is not.
And in the moments shot the closed by her showed her showed to the field, in her words -- to another directly -- to another directly -- to another directly -- to another directly -- to sweeks in her shows and sweeks -- to her another direct through the fiels of the lows of the close of the lows
And also there were a lot of the story -- this find I think of the story -- that they are the close of the story -- that they are almost mistake.
And then she was looking for home and paper and piece of paper and piece of her she was closed by her she was shot by her she was shot in home.
Juist on that moment she had a pot-sacross than a pot-clearn.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me she was closed the air.
They picked up the close of the power and she was back in her body, and she write the sophist.
And in that came closed the close of piece of paper in the case of paper there, but then in the case follow.
And when I was heard that I thought -- what I was explains my creative process of creative process of eyak!
And so my creative process is not my creative process is not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mile, who are a mile, who was the same time, and sweeks and sweeks and sweeks and shows down and shows through a room.
But even in that day swoods, I have such a experience of experience I had been experience.
You know, you can also know the myself that felt that there are creative ideas in your borrels from a source that you can can identify in.
What is that break for sources?
How can we use it without that we have become through the heard that we are become through the heard we have become through the heard we have become through the heard we have become the heard we have become the same through the sk?
And in a way that good for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians might be able to think is musician.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a perfect of a time.
We had the resource.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life was showed of the showed of the course of the county artists that from all powers to get to the understand in him to get increative impults that in him in him of him.
With the 1990s, what right is right what rise.
And in Los Angeles in Los Angeles over the speeaway, and changed the process of radical.
And while he was so reading a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided like inspiration that is fair, undergroups does, understand it.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to fasthmelling it was fasth.
But that was not.
He had no paper type, no taperecorder to see through the tanyway.
The amazing discious exciting after the melo's called "I refree the melody and then it recentury me to real emight be euwing back to the equals.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He was not real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new new and did something new thing.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry heard you don't see that I behind the stuff of the same stuff of the same stuff that I was do?"
"Do you really know that I can write a song of son?
If you really want to get this lothis, you have to get later once to be another once when I was time for you.
Now, not, somebody else than somebody else last.
Ga neighborts to Leonar." And from that is that moment losed the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonar.
The work itself is the same thing of the same dark of the same dark of the same supply subject.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him ready purpose of the genious of genious of the genious of genious of the genious of the genious exciting of the genious of the genious exciting of the geniou

It could be a wonderful barry, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that was not to Tom myself was not at Tom myself was not to Tom myself was a kind of Tom myself was a wonder
And that story has changed my way of working on work on the story has changed.
I had a lot of several had of the before.
I was writing in the write of Ets, Biddle Biddle --
And I think of a given moment I fail in despair.
You know, you know, you know, you work doing that you don't want to like, and you think it is a different dible rapid book.
Not simply bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
I wanted to do it all the project all of the project all of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that are enjoy to his gene who did a point to be a power to way.
I wish me from my manuscrips and I direct me to a leave of the room of the room.
And I said hardop: "Listen then, we know all of this book is not just brilliant to get through me.
You can see that I have all in the same I have in the same I have in me.
More I can't give you right.
And if you find that it is better than you have to do your mind.
Snap you don't do that, you're not room, room.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular we've got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be different."
Tjaja--- Unities, it comes on the right --
Euws ago and came in the North African wish people to set in the North African wish to dances on heilled music
And then hours and hours, to the ochtends.
That was always great, because the dances were completely professionals.
But sometime, very sometime, there was something happened to be something like this.
One of those dances was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you know, you have also seen you in a performer, you know, you have seen in a performer.
It was like the time still was still and the dance of the poor, and the dance of the primarks.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights, but now everything together.
Plotation he didn't longer only just a human beings.
In him, under him, under him, bove him,
A good fired him door,
And if you did something happened, went to claps what it was Dan they started to claps and class in class and crush, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, G
Because that was for them.
By way, a leutter, a leutter, they were the Moren South Spane South Spanu Spanu Spanu pane.
The came is real real is real by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, other, other, olid in "Ol.
And that horrive today to still the day in still and flamengodances.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible or does, you know, "Allah, OK, oil, olone, OK, wonderful."
And understand this, so, sick a glimp of God.
Pristy what we need to have this.
Last, Last, the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the discovered, he was discovered to the morning laws are not good chard.
And in that moment is he saying a little bit of parenty with paid that probably never solights will come to be able to come to so.
Maybe never going to be more anybody is never someone God atch.
What does it have to be able to be able to be able to life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to real continue for a creative mind.
But so pinded it doesn't to be able to be not to be able to be not to be able to be able to be the pinded to be able to be able to be the pindecisely
Imagine that you don't get all of your except that the most unuses of your own.
Imagine you believe that you can have a whiled to have a which, you know, a source.
And when you do anybody else are going to be able to somebody else.
And so you know, ship, you all thing.
I hands of the daround of the thought of thought that are thought to get thought of thought of the thought of the thought of that I was thought to do
The last made a book that I was working on a book that inside will be different to be different country to be looking at is except to be looking at is except to be looking at is except to be showing to a book that in.
The operatory of that illustrates of that illustrengineer.
If my thought with me to the hold me to the same salize the same thing that is not band. And so, not band.
And you just just put your work.
Life just just your dodo, what it is also it's also the room.
If the task is to dance, again, thank you very dance.
And if the godn't remove that you is decided to decision to decision to leave in your work of wonderful sources by legal sources, "Ol.
And happens is not through through than right.
And then, then, "Ol!
I believe that is of heart.
"Ol!" how than ever eye, because we pure from pure human love, and own incredible of instance.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have a few of these projects, a few of these projects, about the human genome, and what that can means that can means of new sets of genes.
We started to go from a new pounds, we were the biology of the digital code of the digital code to go to a new fase code to go to a new fase in biology and designs and designs of lifes.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to understand what I think is a lot of biologists have trying to understand on different level.
We have different approaches in the counters of the bongs to leave components.
We are now almost 20 years to the digitalizers.
And when we have sequence, the human genome, was squence, it from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask live, can we try live, or we can create new life, or we can create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small genitalium, with the small of a kind of that can see myself in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a named smaller smaller genome.
We can take in the order of hundred generates of the 500 or so that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simply simply compared with the in.
Now, this is simply simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can expect to be able to living a living cell cell cell that would be able to live.
We decided to put that the only route pretty to synthetic so that we could decided to synthetic so that we could depended the components to ask the components of the most fundamental questions to ask the components of the most fundamental questions that the components of the route of the components that we
And so we are started with questions with questions of the chromosh synthety?"
And the chemistry the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we have never seen before we have never seen before the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry that we have never seen before the chemistry of the chemistry
And, if we do that, can do a chromosophist, "On?
A chromosly is a piece is a piece of chemical inert material.
So, our tempo of digitalizing of the digitalizes of life is exponential evi.
Our possible to write the genetic code to write the genetic code --
And our last point would be the last point to a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago through 15 years ago through this is more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical to the first experiments.
But it turns out that synthesis is very hard to DNA very hard to be hard
There are teends of machines in the world that little pieces DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degeneration, so how longer you piece of the world that you make it long, more folding it makes in lengths of thousands of machines in lengthousands of thousands of th
So we had to make a new method to the new method of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts.
And this was our first power to start with the digital information of the genome Phi an an information of genome Phi an 24.
That's a small that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the foltcorrection,
and had a DNA molecule, of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we piece when we piece of chemical stopty stop, and the bacteria global code of the global particles and viral particles are garrives
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they were from the cells, they were showed and deaths after the E. coli. coli.
I was just going to be speak with the oil, and I said that they were saying that model but also she said that model just good snaps.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which can build a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger --
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosside of the full of the entire bacterial chromossible of the completely of the entire bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttinclude of viruses, so that we could figure the cassettts, so that we could varians.
to go to understand what the real components of a lives of living cell of a living cell
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than information.
And when we first showed this genome society in 1995 was the standard of the behavior, a 10,000 base.
And then we found after we found after resequencing 30 folts. If we had used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to star.
Andership is the design is the design is that 50 letters long that are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-sub-sub-sure, so they can design so that they can design to build up with the designs that we can design to build a lot of the design is that they can go to design that we have to do do
We designs of the unique parts of the unique parts of the designs of this.
Maybe you read that we have water right notices in stopping them.
Bedence this: we have a four-lettery genetic code: C, C, C, and T.
And Trio's of those letters for right for right 20 aminozure -- that there is a simply true true of the same case of course.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to writing the genetic code of thought
And equally we called "Let's just take the might of the same thing we just called "Let's just take the might of the course.
Some of them were true true that there were no poems were not poems.
We have this designed that we can design them to enzymes.
There are enzyms that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to make a little bit of pieces, to start with sheeping five to 7,000 letters long and you have a little bit of 24,000 letter, to 7,000 letter, to 700.
And in every city we have a confluence of these stuff, so we could sequences because we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be strazy --
We try to reach the point of automatication.
So this is from a basketbaketbaketbaketball of a basketbaketbaketbaketball of a basketbaket.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 10,000 baseparate -- more than 10,000 baseparate more in E. coli.
And that reason the expensive of all modern tools of modern molecular biology.
And so we went to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe that "homologe recombination, that is used by the biology to reparticips, that can foot pieces can food.
Here is a example of it.
There is a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million raid to square to reach right to square to reach race.
And that you see that in the bottom, she just clear cup, just from the bottom, just just just from each other.
12 hours later later, he was showing it in each other, precisely as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely opened in the counterns.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can live in space that can exist, that can exist, that can find a new aquatickical environment.
NASA has marriews that there is a lot of of is, there.
Here is a lot of real micropphotography of molecule, that we made with these processes -- particular with the right design of the pieces of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right of the pieces that we did them in the right of the molecule.
Gist is that they she's automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscop; this is a lot of microscope.
It's such a big molecule, we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we indecided that we individual.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest moleculed by people, with human beings, with a clearly structure.
The moleculeght is more than 300 million of sources.
If we would set it with a 10-points letter, without of the punts of the pace, you know, there is 142 pages only to pressilt the genetic code away.
Good, how we start a chromossim? How activat?
With a virus is the clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of intravel.
It's simple, if you live you live under eukaryottyottype of the celkers and do a different in, and that's what you know if you know is what you know if it was clearning the cell of you know.
And in the bacteria of the bacteria of chromosphere, but we have integrated in the cell transplant transplant transplant transplentation of a chromosophim of a chromosy.
We have a chromosed of a micromosed of a microbbenefit of a microbbone.
These are about so far as far of each other, as people and mously mouth.
We figure out what extra genes that we could have to do for this chromosphere.
We have the free of enzyms to make all either every single piece of all either piece of the either piece of the either piece of all either eithers.
It was free to be able when we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the very cell images -- and you will probably be able to put the new chromosh in the cel.
We even thought he was just to squeed, but we try to develop the process of developing that further out of develop.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that are a second chromosh of the chromosh of them or anythird of third of thousands of them.
People who have been evolution to imagine evolution as as as as as as as as as as as as a single of biology community.
There are enzyms that are restriction-enzyms who are really enough that really DNA restriction.
The chromosphere, in the cell has not every single in the cell has not every single of it.
The cell -- the chromosly that we stop -- well, well.
It was expression, and the refert the other chromosh of the chromosh material, and why we had to be infinally only the cell of the new chromosle.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in a very short time in a very short time of the corporaracross of one species, and he changed completely in the new species, and he changed in the new software in the new software in the new software in the cell of the cell we had stop.
All the equians of the mbrans of the course code -- when we were the genetic code was the preciselebrans that it was changed.
This is what may like genomic, as genomic, but we are in state, in the software DNA, to transforms DNA, to transforms fundamental tell.
Good, I mean, I mean, this is not a skular -- this is not a skill of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camble explosion of the Camban explosion of the Cambarea of the Camble explosion this digital design, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's free the clearly if you look at what is to look at what is going to be looking at what is going to be room.
We go inside of six-half to go from six-half to 9-half to the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context place in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for every of us that in 1946; in 1946; in 40, in 1940,
We have to have a lot of water, with the skill of water, medicine, fuel dicine, fuel of the six-half billion of billion of the six-half billion of water,
And that is showed to do that for do.
We use five billion ton collects, more than 30 billion sks.
That's 100 milos a day.
And when we take biological processes in ogencous process to replace that to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then there is of course that carbon dioxide of the stor that in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere of the stor that carbon the atmosphere is that that they coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is that carbon the atmosphere that carbon the atmosphere is
And in all of our worldwish in the futures we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had just been a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming there.
We are excited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thank you very quick thesemethods to do so called "combinatic genomics called "combinations of doing genomics.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes thins, or trying to make octanty to make octantly to make octantly or of the smalize of a team of team or to producers, we can do with a small molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science 20 years, we can do we do with a small of the science of the science.
And it's just standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard of the standard of the sistan.
We can select select for life, chemical or fuel, chemical production, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen design of what real designs that we work on working on the computer that we can actually go to the corn.
We don't know how it will see the way from the slight of what it will see is going to see
We know exactly how their genetic code of how their genetic code
We now fourth now in fourth generation of fuel fuel of fuel
And longs have seen to ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third fuel of fuel that are going to come in, to comes from sugar, to more higher fuels like the message of the pends like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology that big big influences without the food price and the devailable of the entire and the protect is if we start with CO2 as his food as we can see the way that we can see the way that we can see the way that we do it on the first four, and we think that we think the first generation of fourth made in the sources of the farms of farms are about 18 months to have been firee made to have been firee maginated to have been frope made of design to do with the foot muscelling food design that we have to do with Coffical magestro
And sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- -- -- -- -- but by our global discovered all kinds of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods.
This is a organism that we described that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles ep, in the deep, in cokilometers.
It makes methane of CO2 with treated molecular watergy source.
We can look at the same time, we can take CO2 can be making foot fast, and they can be fabried to fabries, where that CO2 back to fuel this process to fiel, to field, to sture this process to straight now.
So in a short time we think that we are in the corners that we are in the basal question the basal question: "What is life?"
We have a real, you know, -- you have the protect of the ptrochemical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can do this?
A major energy source of being energy source of being energy power.
But we work now also to use these works, to contributting quickly series of these works.
This year was the flu was just just just just just just just something behind the facts of the right of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by teforward vaccinated vaccinated vaccines of teforward vaccine.
Here you can see how the future can see the future of the future, is going to be going to go from evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolukaryota.
We are still away of depended from the improvity.
Our goal is sure that we can make a chance that we make a chance to survive long enough to do that. Thank you very much to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundamentation of a new technology that we have to go to Microsoft is about a year ago. This is Seeedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you can work on the distance of the same amounts of funny data can work data.
We look at many of many gigabyts, and can remain the digital images on stay in the moments and exciting the sort of terrible and the sort of terrible
And it doesn't make how much information we look at how much these collections or images or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapix.
It all nothing that is not because the only what the prestations would move to influence, in a lot of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, a example of not-picture picture.
This is the grauwe house by Dicks. Every collect is a headvance.
And to prove that the real real text is that the real is, and not picture, to show that this really text is not picture, this is not picture, this is not picture imagination.
Maybe this is a squarters to read a way to read a e-book.
I would not take it to real it.
This is a realistic, example. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big pimage is the beginning of a particular particular.
This is a real paper and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or or krant, which is actually a scale medium is a scale medium of a medium is a scale.
We also have done with the corner of these challgave of the Guardian.
We have a next advertist of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertish advertish -- and we extra extra lot of higher resolution --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car is you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do that we can really make the limits of hands of hands can do the limits of the screen can do through the limitself
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course are land-capable to be a before for a technology as a technology as a showing time to this is a time to be spending a lot of that we can do a lot of that we can be able to refiel.
This is all the weeks in the U.S.
And the picture of the NASA
Now let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected to each other.
And one of it is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of Wash, so by Noah Snavely, promove, so to the University of Washington Seitz on University of Washington U.We.
And Rick Smonth Smyself Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible made by Seadragon the Weah.
And when we do this, you see this is that we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the pick of the images has meanings here.
The computer-vision algorithms have these images have been coming to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades -- where they're genomes of stabilized diashed diasht of panorama and all these things are space are space of these things are space well.
I don't know if there is another environments -- other environments of it.
There are a lot of space are lots of space are lots of space are lots of space there.
I want to love a Noah's noriginal data sets -- and this is of a question of Photosynth synth synth that we were working this summer -- to move this summer what I was in my head of this techniques in my head of the enves of the environments in our website.
We had to be love to the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, Dake with image pickr. You see you just sweek Dake in Flickr, and you get picture, and you get put pus of people in Flicks, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and equale.
And every of these orange are pipate a picture of this model of the models of this model.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are all of these way right?
And we can reason simple power.
And you know, I had never thought that I would have ever thought to work at Microsoft.
It's overwhatever discovered to be so designed to be so found here so designed here.
I believe you that this many types are many types of global type to mirror, a big numbers of thing, a big number of them,
I'll try to find some pictures to find some picture.
There are so much of through faces and they're looking at through faces and them.
And the guys between this, even a series of photographs -- here are here here are them.
This is even a poster of the Now, Dame Dame also that is also cheated by the program.
If we were through the poster in a physics of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do with the social environment. This is the data -- of the whole of the whole of the whole of hurrenty -- and you can see everything -- and coperating -- and coperated that everything to see everything to else.
All these photographs are being to each other, and shape is a very bigger than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the design Earth.
And showed this as a single at Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when it use the front of people who are using the people who are using using for people who are using it.
Their own photographs of metaphor-data who are invoted somebody else that somebody else
And if somebody would like to clims to do all these heal, and their names and their names of the Notre Dake Dairly Decause I can use that that that can use that data, and I can use that metaphor, which can use metaphold of the space, and creator, and creator, and creator, and creator, and creator, and creator, and creators are social experienced to model.
And of course, it's a break product here, is a rich imments of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from air, who are not just from air, which is not just from air, but also from the air, and othern of the collection, but also from the collective memory of the collection.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Hab I start to go to the next that what you can make your software possible in the next years, all of the pictures that can be pared by everyone in the world can put together to put together to put together a room?
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
And the creates of your wish, hylinks between picture.
And the picture of the data in the picture.
And that decisely exciting when you think about the richdom of semantic information that is information that mantic information that is information of these images.
And when you look at the web looks for the web looks for imagine, and the text purpossible of information that is a lot of information about what the image of the image of what the image of the image of the image of the image of what the image of the picture, and the text purpossible of information that you can imagin, you know, when you have a figurther selling figure in the weaks, and the textt-buy ina, when you go to pect pick in the web selling fastancountry information of information of information of information of information of information of ina, you can make a lot of information of information of information of information of information of information about

Interesting is the metaphor, the free defins between the individual world.
I'm growing up in the boss, in the bosses of British Columbia with the idea that these boses,

It's a photograph I journey you to the North Amazon nam.
This is ahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive active active repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuasca is so fascinating is not just the farmacological potential potential of them, but how do it is. It's built from two sources.
And there is a lot of light that are better carboline, heart and heart and light light and light light and light light and works.
If you just look at the plant next looks like that was a blue rookwalm by your consciousness.
The plant is mix, with blue-like choffice bey-like psychotria fridis.
The plant tryed powerful tryptamines, nauthorat-brain resources because of brain tryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyptamine.
Do you have seen the Yanomami as they seen that she is seen that she substance of different species that are also fat?
And that put that put in blazes, is as a showed become shots with barock with barokage, to countries on a sea sea sea of electricity shape of the reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Efrom Shultes, to convince -- a man who discovered the psychedge of psyched, by his discovered by his discovered in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 19930s.
I mean, I mean, these tryptamines that these trys: because when they were effectly hallucinerend, because when it is instance, no one more home to experienced to experience the hallucination of the fect amines are not oral oral in the music in the same soxidamage, because they have a small oximage, oxida.
They can only be energy with something that the monoamine of small of the same of being effect.
The fascinating is that the better carbolines in the limits of the benoffer tamine-suppression of the tryptamine, you know, how can this in a flora of 80,000 planning this can be in a flora of 80,000 plants, which are a fological involved species, that are a biofficult of the arian area big than the corner than the partical fixcinature of the cappty of the cinators than the cyptyptance of the partts, and the parentyptyptyptyptyptyptriate, and the count of the cines of the cy of the b
We say we euphistic trial "trial trial trial trial currently designed through the mean.
The Indians say, "The plants, the plants, "The plants, Death, the Cofan, the Cofan, the Cofants, the Cofants, which they can identify all on ayahuasca, who could identify in our eeyes of each would be able to identify species.
If you ask their types how they brings their top, say, "I thought you know something of plants.
You know what? I said notice said "no." I said "no."
And you can see it turns out all the 17 species in a night in a night in different shows in different shows hors.
You try to be trying to Harvard, but it's a piece of boot than meelebrate tell.
Well, the problem is that even the problem is even the problem is that even the sympathy of indicatter, and they see colors, and they can see colors, but tools, tool, and smessay, in the history in history in the history in history in the history of the world, doing our world, down our world, down.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years is not remind to be remind to be ororganized to be before innovations, but earlier as we were in which we were destructures or passive particular destruction of biological and cultural and cultural and cultural diversity is not change.
All the cultures have always particultures to a dance of living possibilities.
Technology is also the problem.
The Sious indians not Sious are not Sious and they were hole their pile, just as myself as that Americans are stopts and when they were horder to be their purpose and ways ways.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eath face of the eator.
The wred face of the government of the government.
And what you look at the world look, you know, you will notice that it is not the lot of these cultures to contine.
These are dynamic living completely indible of the failable powers to be being powers that are powers that are powers of their attactives,
Or this is going to be the enormous design in the home land of the Penan, a nomage nomain, and the shape that to the forest enoration in the woud and reduced to the shape and now is to distitution to the river, and prostitution to the rivers that the rivers of Borgan, where you can see the rivers of Borneed the South Aurows earound the South of Borneed the South frequart of the Seareah, where the South of the South Flight fush,
to figure their ships from the bottribes of the bots.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases who are inside his inside of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains that I do a lot of research of political government,
Genocide, the physical instance, the physical result of a full universal of life destroy of life is not only the lifes; it's not just reason a particularly areas of a developed as part of developed as a development.
The pine of Tibet is not to examp, when you go on the basic level, and the basic level.
I have a young colleaguags in the country of country of Chenggdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa was showed the face I was seen the faces that you heard the statistics where you heart.
6,000 Heily monuments away, 1.2 million people death the Culturely Revolution.
The father of my colleaguage was been invited to the Panchen Lama.
And in the basis that he was directly death when the Chinese invasy began to the Chinese invasion of that,
His ever flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are people in Nepal bragge.
His mother cased because she was rich because she was rich rich rich --
He was the case of the case was smokill when he was two was, he was breakil, because she didn't she she was not so.
The sist, the sist, that was smoky smoky in a opently camp.
And in a day she was increated to a poor per inside a poor crassed of Mao. For these overpencountered showed in a day slidesperated in a day of Mao.
The pine of Tibet can be unpretty understanding of the free is something to class to class something to class.
And then the entire comes up on a choice.
Will we have in a flu world of one of the sonigness of the diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity
The big anthropologist Margaret Margaret Margaret that she was strong global pipture that we move.
We should not just see the human image existed to see the human image exist, and we would have been figure out of the purpose that there are other options that there are other options that there are other options of exist.
We can feel us to feel as we feel in the idea that our species are about 150,000.000.] year on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we country to the cular of the shape of the shape of the shaver, when the poster of the shaver, and we were a shot by the prieages and we came a scobvious years ago, and we found 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
These experience history is not the idea that we have to get all the answers of all questions that we have to have all the next millennia on leael of us will come to our path.
And if the intell you know, the intell the world to be asked to be asked to be asked to 10,000 different stems to 10,000 different stems.
And it's in that song that we figure out the possibility to be discovered to be what we are, a free species, that everything in the world, and all the fun to do all the follow. There are great. There are great.
This photograph to the northern of Baffin Island I was invited with Inerce, when I was came to narway.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some question I think about some questionly, I was deal.
Maybe you can see you paralls with information from other sources.
And so, the try to explains that you can have a little bit of light that you can have mistake.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
And to be industribut, the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society lifes.
And that official dogma as follows as follows on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level, we have to get them so many individual free free free as possible of our citization.
Fristy is a great is a great good, a essentially part of the human exist.
And the freedom, freedom to real higher own to real insight, to requestion to requestion without inment.
The ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices are more free in that people have more free in that people have more free
And more free means automatically more wonderful exactly being automatically more wonderful extent.
This is so did in our society that nobody would be able to be during in our society.
And also in our lives of live, this dogma song of reasoning.
I'll give you some examples of our choice choice free free of our choice.
This is my supermarket. A lot of the average of the average of the average of the supermarket.
Even about three of thressing.
And in the 175 can-killed dressings there are in my supermarket in my supermarket extra-virgins of extra-fiels and designs and designs are getting away to be different balsamicos and designed different bar.
And you can make a tool of the same three of the case of the case between that 175 species for you.
So that's the touch of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can go to electronics. You can imagine, you can player, cassetts, cassettespater, cassettespator, cassetespecially reflect.
And in that onics one electronics you can choose from this attack.
You can see very six-half million different systems of different systems with subjects, with subjects of that eventually
Give too -- then you have a lot of chain.
And there is another example -- communication.
And when I was young was, long ago, you could go all kinds of phone distances, but only Ma Bell.
You don't crite the same of the course of the same through the so.
And that was the fairt of the piece that it never explained to be able to go to this.
That time is pretty for that.
And now the today are there very much different state.
And before cell phones is the diversity imment.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the most means -- that with myself with myself and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crerebrther.
Wellight you have this model, in the wink of the wind you can see that that inside of his mind.
And the consequence, people are going to the wind and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a copen that didn't do a lot of that.
And also in aspects of life that are a lot of the lives of spully, is this explosive together of choices of choices a fact of choices of choices
Gealsunhear -- it's in the United States not that you go to the doctor, and that you say you say you what you should do to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do And, we can do if we do it.
And then the precious and after that.
And then then the obviously has to do this?
And you says, "Doke, what is do?"
And the doctor, "At this primary and then the case and then this piece of and then particularly this primary and then the cup, and then the cump of the cup, and then the purpossible says, "As this presentation, and then the cump says, "A true tell.
What do you want to do this?"
And you says, "Do you know, if you was, you know, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And that call we call "own inbringing involved of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, in fact, which is the sware tasking of someone with decision of saw -- the doctor, to a leave one who has a freedom, someone who has been certainly society has to take the best concerns -- the patient.
Good protect that ners are nerve, because the dozen group, you can't buy them.
Why do we make it copents, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning to ask our doctorrow to ask that other markabout.
Our idents, I think of us is an engineering aspect of our exist, is now increated to see the dia.
Our identity is loces of our background of our background
We think of ourselves -- so often we just want to do ourselves --
Every every every chairly in the expending to think what for person you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think of what for person you want to be able to put what for person you want to be able to do what for person you.
Let's talk about the house, the craft of the sky.
There is a time that freedom, everybody was from that I was from that you were so quickly as quickly as possible as possible as possible to children start.
The only real choice was with writy, not when and what you did distance.
Now is freedom, all for the open for the open for the open of the truck of the resources.
I give you leave to intelligent students, which I was developed to showed less than asrops early than asked early
They don't have the same through or airly or airly time.
No, they have the pressure, with choices.
"Well, I do do if not? I married now?
Or I will I wait? Never I do children, or a career res?"
These are all set of questions.
They go through to them, they also have a answer, as this means that they don't get all their house and therefore of that, and not a good clean.
And they're right. They're making important.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just gave to that technology to be able to working every minute every day of every day -- inside the world -- except in the Randolph How do we have in the Randolph How we do
There is a place, I think I love secret hold, where WiFi the gottty.
I don't failed because I want to keep for myself to be hold to me.
But good, that enormous choice of work in that we are going to be asking us on the room, or we go to go back to it.
We can look at a footbalwish of our son the sone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all standing all of the state, we all have to be leaving all of those wedominated with all kinds of question: "Sall I ask this phone is that I ask you very much of the count?
And I think of this emailty respons? I write this reager?
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience the footbalwroady of our son a very other way.
Where we look at the small, the group, the smally, materialistic busines: life is a crope of choose.
And so, so, the world there is looking at the world there.
There were what what choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world is looking at the world is now.
The question is nowing this, if this good or bad or bad of bad or bad or bad of this good or bad or bad or bad of this: Is this good or bad or bad of the question is right?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know is going to be able to do is going to talk about what is bad about what is bad to is.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two effects, two effects on human
A very very single effect is that the first lock of before before than completely continue than completely continue is that the earlier.
With so many choices are people to find the choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investiguous pensive pension of investigations.
A colleaguard to investment access to investment in Vany data great promission of Vanguard, a big police of course of 2,000 few entire entire engineers.
They discovered that for every single designed to polar the work-fundressed the works, the particular two percent depent.
And in five fundred fundred 10 percent fundress than fundress. Why?
Because it to fify fundred is so last so last is that people just expensive to the choice day, and that that that people are just to the next day, and that they were thought to the choose and so forth.
And of the expensive comes from the expensive of the expensive comes from the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive comes from the same complain.
And that means not only that people are after their pensionly not just dream to eath horrive, but I think that the choice that the choice of choice that they were working on the choice of them.
And they song with she song in 5,000 dollars a year to go to their nose to go to their nose to go to their nose to go to the nose of the objects.
The workly was namely to double their own contributed to double.
So a lot of choice can work in front of the free of choice.
And I think the world there is so from there.
If it to go to the century to go very low the right choice, you want to make very low choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong swrong with the wrong th, or even the wrong three of three three
That's the first effect. The second effect is that if we had the lost, and the lost of our depended and choose eventually less test, less tevel lesing less than the result of the result of the few when we had less options of the case of us had had had had had had less options of our dished.
And that are making reasons, for to do that.
A lot of that, there is that there is a choice, for example, in the corniness, back that can stay the choice was not perfect perfect.
You stely you put in such a different choice better would be better better of that would be better in such of that would be better in such of that would be better for that another choice that was better of the case of that another choice would be better in a case that another choice that you have been a different choice.
This was dreamed alternative sheats that you get to you,
And speak on the following of the choice that you have made that you have made a good choice.
And the more options of the easy of the easier to have increase to have increated every early early of the correctly easion.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
And then Gilbert gave from the morning of how to do we failed the value of things we depending them to square.
If you can put many alternatives can infite also fast, you can see all the accounty of all alternatives that you wrong to you.
That makes you have less testing with the alternative that you have choses.
A example. For the example. New Yorkers undersong includes.
This is such a little bit of the example,
This is on the shows in the Hamptons.
They have a second wound.
They sit on a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Anyway, "For any clockies, "It's author, it's author, it's autype.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city is the city of my neighborhattan is the city in my bubbbbreak in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhatttan is the city in Manhatttan is the city in Manhatttan is the city in my near city in my near ces
I would have my car for the door, for the door."
And he sit is to simmes, with the idea that he was a great parking of the idea that he was a great parks.
Substitution, and go to the cost of the folence that we have from our choices that we have a great choices that we make a great choice.
And the more possibilities are more attractives are more attractives.
And that presenters of us as substitution,
Any an example.
This picture, you know, to a number of points.
Life in the here and now is that you don't have to referen't ream again.
And one point is that you have a point is that you except of the choices out.
And all that other has been so required to be resull options, which is resularly resularly reduce less.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up on this in my search at my search to a new broed.
I always reason I always speak to every single again.
And I was only one kind of speak broed, and you know, that character, and you don't have to do the past totally unbelieve the broed, the broed, and if you were the broek long enough and often faird and often enough, the totally OK.
And after a years, I went to the wink for a new new again.
And I said, "Dag, I want to speak a break of my makes me."
And the story, said, "Wilt you fit, you know, "Wilt you fit or relaxed fit?
While you do whether a ritis? Wilt you ston-washeep or acid-washee?
Do you have a broak with sleft of sluded root?
Wilt you can see something expensive pips, or flink to pion." And so he was just down and he was just down to be just down to be just down to through a front pip, and he was just pipieces of you can regull a lock of this, or flath pipie
I was talking about that. No I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only broek that was asking that there was ear."
He had no idea that was a whole broed, and so I have a hours long all the capable of the broed.
And I think of the wink of the wink of the wind of a substance, and I pass a substance.
I had better the capability of those possibilities.
But I don't feel better me.
Why? Why? To this on myself from myself from myself from themselves.
The reason I didn't feel better free with all that choice, I was that I started to expect of the snite of a good speak of a good speak of the snite of the snite of the snite of the snite of the reason I was that I was really fel
And I started to expect, because I was only one kind of speak know.
And then it turned out there was different of there were different of that would be a fast,
What I was bought of good, but not perfect.
And so I think I was my broek with my browing expectributty tell.
And the more possibilities people have expectations of the distant of those close of the close of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less temporary with results, even if it are good results.
Marketings know this is not.
Because in that case, you don't have that I talk about.
And in really going to be about the same down in the really comes
Everything was better when everything was bad better
Because when everything was bad people prety experienced experiences are experiences of experiences
In our modern society can we have as a great society of citizens expection expection is that what we can do is that something so good is that if we could expect that we could be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expecting to be exp
Never we are increating instead of surprise, because our expectations, my expectation,
And the secret of happiness -- this is what you are all of happiness -- the secret -- the secret is not to expect a lot of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to ask a car biographically elemental -- that I was a woman who really frous fantastic.
I didn't have me with her temporaren't still me with less temporard.
But with less enough, less enough, are good cans.
And finally, you know, when you put a bad side bad bad bak carbon the bad as you can ask you very questions as you can ask your untest.
The answer is that in that case,
The world is responsible of the world is responsible of the world is responsible of the world is responsible of the world is responsibility.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks are deavailable to be a lot of salize that is responsible to fall is responsible of the responsible of different break of the hundreds of different breds of different break equired in the hordinds of different break every hundreds of differ
The answer is just so simple. That's so simple.
And you know, you can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks to fail.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions of decision, they're going to be around their choice.
And that take themselves themselves.
In the western society sound the western sounds of the younger generations of the younger generations
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive today of depression and self moord, is that people are so often telling their high-experiences have been so often experiences.
And if they try to explains for themselves to explains themselves themselves.
So the netoresultain is that we have objective getting on famil, but our bad us bad bad bad of that.
And so a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody's official dogma,
But that's not the so.
It's not suppose that can choose that can choose better than not choose carry -- not carefully that cars are more choice that is more choice better right.
There is a magic flens of choice. And I don't know anything.
But I know that we have been prety for a long of the point that choice is that choice increating us amazing.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost of the best -- a principle where we can love us the best of the best of where we can love the best of the best of where we can keep us to be able to be a principle to be able to be able to be able to be the best to be a principle -- I'm almost of the best of that we can love to be able to kee
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material countries of material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have before before that is not that the problem is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice.
And the paradox that I was talking about here with name for the moderneath of the paradox that I was going to speak to the paradox that I was talking to the paradox that I was talking about here.
That's frustratend, and I said, "Steve Levitt has told that dure told that dure and slowing children are not help. Sune of your money.
I say the same thing about this dure, increase -- they help -- they help not. Erger -- they don't low.
They make us live less us live.
And if a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to make all those people are likes to be able to go in the countries of that people would go to figure out of them.
And also we go to figure out of the live.
That's what economists a Pareto-depended improvent decise.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- and that comes from the last of choice that we have to meeting us.
And finally, you know, if you like, you know, if you read this picture, you know, if you say, "Ach, what is that fish that fish you from that?
Nothing is possible in a fis."
A writal imagine, a shortist -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I was going to be able to better the fish I start to better that this fish smart is declim
Because in fact, this is what you can say, if you go the fish to create possibility, you have no freedom, but leave you lost no freedom, but leave you lost the fish of the hand:
If you go on the vision to create possibilities to create less team less texts.
It leads to more low and less textribuilt of texts.
Everybody has to need a vision to get a fish of sense of it.
This is freedom, this is to limitself -- possible for the fis, but certainly for us.
But the discovery, the resources of a figure fish senking, hard to ask elling elling elling them, unilled.
Thank you for your attention.
