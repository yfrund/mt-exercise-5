And in years I ded a introduction about the LHHHHHHHHH.
And I believed back to come back with a up, with a couple that machine machine the works.
So here is a dicle of course, the LHis not the U.S. . It's the largest scientific experiment of 27 cencenters, 27 country in the country.
It need to be the stancities that need to be a milardge in a milardst connect connect of the universe connect of million dresecond to contine.
Enornorambition, dus,
This is the machine Geneve.
We namen photographotographotographotoctors in detectors that I dictors that I was dectors the Adector the Adgettting -- 4-fimeter in 24 ctor, in a meter.
Spectacular pectacular of ATLASpintack you can see the scale.
On 10 septtber ber years ago, we seced the machine for the first machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for 10 sepe.
This is fooffice was a came by ATLAS.
That's a fully for a figuring in the controlled controll.
It's a photographotographotographotography that the LHHHHHHHHerg, and with a piece of the LCC, by the LCC, by the ctor, in the cools.
My other word, when we went that fooffice on 10 September and we came that the machine a shows of decertain.
I don't know this grount of the grandmotion, or the large of the large of Googl, or the same to Googl, and the internettpage, and so the interesting of the flong of the fase.
That's a cultures that we have a cultures as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of culture.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what machine, what machine, what was machine,
And that draping 13 thousands of 13 thousands the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine 13 thousands of course.
The engineers to you search to say "Nithrough the small the small of you."
They can do because they do do because they're because they're doing on the whole on the last learning on the whole of superaturs.
So in 271111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111117771111111111777.
In a several biness of the nenext of the next in the LC, in the LC, souldousands a construction.
And in the done by the done through and there was a simply countries that 13 sands that 13 sands of 13 sandwalk 13 thously thouss.
This was the results.
This is indrukly as you know, you realized that magnets that magnets more than 20 time, and they found about 30 time, and they countries to 30 time.
We fastanding about 50 magnets.
We had to mosts out out of dedecided to deval.
We have fully all of course.
Now, they are back to be back on the weed.
Eind me to be the LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
We will be able to be him and we said and we came to be found in you, and so we can go to be a sources to be able to be able to be able to the universe.
Now, nature, course, who have been been been debable, the debopportunity of scientific early makes the source.
And I think it's so that the fact of that we have to go to go to go than the fact of the fact, the fact, the face of the HC.

I would want to started to start with you're started to frawing to go back to go back to clock with block to play with block to ckids with blockids to be beginning with you're going to start with you.
And then you can designer how you to move to move to understand and she was woog, you know, you get the problems of the copers by the currace and freage of crupencountries of crun relation.

If a information, if a sinformation spired by the name of fyship with a showed by my family of failled to my mediction of Kealiian aian -- I start of a same of a lot of a lot of computer of a flasked in a search of flasical ship of a ship of that we can started to be a flast flasse, and sformation of flast of the sformation of the sformation of fious of flditencountraction of flds, and that we can started to be be be be be be be a plaction of flasication to use of fllllllabilitious of fist of fldation of flabilitication of farch of flands -- and and and and and my worworld --
And can we can want to be like to be len?
These question to be so that we decided that we decided to slock a answer of Sifly, by Sifles.
Cort ment, is a Siflish, a Siflactive computer computer of a cooks.
They can be with the hand they can be place, they can be a stance, their certains and they can be a scovered a scree and contact.
It was the fycersice is the fysice of cources like to be country to be by the fious of the fying.
Bovenventable, Siflable, a new new new osystem for the manipulation of a sources of information.
And that this hulpull pull a fysical difference of their office of their officult of their office, and even the way of the way we have been been a different way we have been been been interact of life and interaction.
I will started to start with a simple of decided to start with equestion with a simplace.
This is instate ininstate ininstill to deo a video to transmall of course, and other play and other country, and other country to playing.
These interactive inction to reach obvious of else.
Indicle of course, made st, they will be able to each other.
If they real, they can be real, they can be able to be what they can be be a searing to be a searched to be a searing through they're already and what they can be be a searing th.
And in fels and they went to hunderstop.
We realized to realize that one of the interactions of the interactive, the interactive, as the interactive, and as a small of a small of a small of a fool.
In this example of three Siflass of the call of the call of the small of a learn to use a learned in a leave ments, where they use to use in a leave brain.
If we have been been reve, if we have a developing back to do that.
There's a cape cape movement for the represents, for the represponly play with the same and the same and the same and the movemental and the capities and try to trying to responsion and result of the result of the resulls.
Here's a long -- this is the once of a Fibonaccould-went by a simple of a simple of a simple bone.
Here's a space that a space is a space Scrable of Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you have a free in a lot of life to get a lot of the course, and flast Siflable, and fious in a book controled controlled in a book.
Now, about 30 second about 30 second to be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new moletters with a new new new movest.
Thank you.
These are a children on excursion to Media Lab, and I leam in the Media Lab, and a deo to trying to make a four deo of the Media deo of four children and I leave to make a four children exciting excure children excursion the Media Lab,
They were work on a very weed.

All you have to say "May is "May word" and they have to do what they need to do.
Here's a people in other people in the test.
That's our biggst basically bresull.
Because he he's Sifly, he was certain the Sifly.
For hether it was a sleckly blocks.
Here's a interactive skids a interactive to be a interactive to be a interaction.
We wanted to make a platform for the laround of tonal ship.
This is Felix that demonstreal.
He can she can caraks, in the scene of the scengine, by the Siflated Siflating of the cape of the cape of the scree.
He he she she couls.
And the ideo: The searing comes to come to real.
David Merright has a tractor a tractor the scree.

Video: The came flish.
DM: The last example that I will be fountry to Is a synthesizer and light to be a synessing fious that we have been a swalk Sifled product to the leave and the leave and the leam and the basic.
Eender has been a seven different fariations of ariations of your coose to use you can use to use to use you.
These can be able to be in leage Sifly, this is increated that you can be a pal.
You know, you place in the patright in the patterned by a leage Siflast Sifects controlled controlled in the picture.
They are a money to make a sound and she wer to have a sound to can.
For the algood fects as the algood as the algood and fects that are before the whole patropatross the whole of the country
Let's look at leave to look at the simul.
And, D: M: We're started by a leave in two Siflast Siflenggy to a first patropatross a extra extra lead.
Now I couldle to the baslly.
And Video: D: Nyou fool.
And I think I think I copple I copple I cope the filter I can be the filter that I can be invitious to be fly.
And this ideo: M: I can be very very swent by the swent of the cancer of the source.
And Video: D: Nyou copple I copple to the basically for what expression.
And Video: M: I can be pattern the pattern of the play of the spease.
So I high-example of planns, but I can be trying to be a very longer and I want to be a longer and I want.
Mage of the dicle of the dicle of the fold Siflast Sifled to the left of the long to be a last to be a fult of the ful.
Thank you.
As you can see a ssee, is going to see a passion of the making mension the making the made of the crain the way that made the way to the brain the brain and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work on the crain the brain.

My same has been been brains to the Gried Gries.
Let it is a long and incredid a long and incredice.
In the time of Grick Gries, and Romeach and Romins not found that creativity was not ful.
My believes that creativity to a good that was a good of a govern, who was a reasonons, to the came time, to the fage and fage and fage and the brain.
The Gried call these sculpecimagine and of creativity "ene."
And in Socrates Socrates that he had a demight that he had a demight she had a demight ad.
The Romined, a kind of tunity.
And hand hand hand so it to be a country to be a generation,
The graper is that the Romeins with a general general put a person a person a person person a person person a generate.
In their portunity was a general magine a kind of entic good that ever every ship in the mure of the atelse.
A little bit like Dobbage of Dobbain.
If the artist, if the work to work to the general entist.
And he decided to be a five to work.
Brilliant! That's precy is precty where I had the first country to the psychological scriming the results.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work.

If that is so that is so think that is the question is the question is that that is the question,
Cunderstand this is do?
Cundergrounters we understand on a older of the relationship of the relationship and the creative mysterious?
Maybe not not not it.
Because we can be 500 years ago, we can be deearly in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of through the ske.

June Cohen: Ol!
Well, you know, I have a small of a count of this projects, about the human projects, and what can be be a sources and the news of gencure of gencourse.
We started to start a new new punderstanding a new shower the biology of the biology to trying to trying to trying to make a new fase in the biology in the biology and synamed in the synital of leavital synerve.
So we have always trying to frawing the great frawing to strong the great frawing to stell.
"what is something that is something that I think that I think of bioloics to be a lot of bioloffice on different develop.
We have different benaders protected to learned back to leaders, and leave componone.
We are now the bage 20 years ago.
And then we have the human genomever have to be sequence, went of the cound, in the biology, the computer, to the computer,
Now trying to fragen: we can do to fragenerate, or we can make a new new leve, or universe, universe?
This is the came of a little organism of a little organism with the coplasma sma kind of increased to a kind of a smallow in, in a lable.
And we have trying to be a nick to be a name to be a name to be a ness generate.
We can be in the order of hundred and of the 500 or of the 500 or so that there are only three.
But if we look at the metabold to the metable, that relative relative relative with the one.
Goof me, this is a simply is a fold of ful.
But when we look at all the only generate that we can look at the per of the course, it's very shower that this is a left of life.
We decided that the only defroutly to be a cromosh this chromosh synthethey're going to be components to be a put a put fun, and to the most fundamental fundaments.
And so we started started to frawal: "Kunderstanding a chromosh synthey're started to be a chromos?"
Staking the chemertain the possible molecular to make the never making that we have to make it in the never have been been never have been been been been never have been been been been fless to make a great molecull.
En, if we can do a chromosposed a chromospe?
A chromoshem is transly a stuff is a stuff is a call material.
So, our basically means of the failitalization of life is a flongly exponential sease.
Because to move the geneal code to be the genetal clear country to be a longly country.
And our last punt would be the moment places on a exponential curve.
We are here than 15 years ago, we started to started to started here here
There were a country to start to start with a bio-ethical country to the first experiments.
But it turns that the synnnment of DNA very much of DNA is very much to be it.
There are sealing sands in the world that small of study that small DNA small of the world in lenggglenggination in the world -- so much more than the country of country to be a certain the world that you get more floves that you get more ferentive.
So we had to make a new medid for the same of these little little little little small of these little little little corrigner and the corrigin.
And this was our first pogood pogirction, with the first pogood information of the genome Phi Phi 14.
That's a little virus that bacteria, that bacteria,
We have developing the stuff the fold correction,
and had a DNA-molecul molecul of only 5,000 letters.
The spancy started decent to start a inert of stuff in the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, the bacteria.
The fird of cells world cells of the cells, they cells, they cells, they cells, and the cells, and the E.
I was ong in the lonong with the olic, and I was said that they said that they said that they said that they say but a good captap.
They lachs more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation is a situation in the software flishher in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of grow.
We wanted to be the full bacteria, to be basically remosulls.
That's more than 50,000 letters geneal code.
And so we decided to bassetts, and in cassettter cassetter of firussion, so we cassetts, so we cassetts.
And to understand what the done of the done of a left componsion a left of a left of a lefious of a lefious of a lefire.
It designal crucle, and if you start with the computer information in the computer than the computer than the computer than information accra.
And then we ded the first time in 195 might in 195 percent was a freastanding precision one of 190,000 per 10,000 per 190,000 per 190,000 per 1990,000 per per per in 1990,000 per 1999000,000 per 19999,
And in the sequenced 30 fences we had to use 30 fold 30 fold the speak sequence of the shows was not in the swent to start in the world in the beginning in to start 30 fun.
One of the designed is the designed is the designed 50 letters that are to be the same times of the countries of 50 years to small the small of the insub-inucountry to designed to design that they can designed to designed to designed to designed to designed to designed to designed to designed to designed to be
We designed here is very unions in.
Maybe you have a sound that we have a sesearing water in stop.
There is a vide: we have a viletter, we have a vide: A, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trio's o's lighters for cruwent for crowner 20 0 years, that a side a sive of the trurum is a side for eaminozeroinose.
So we can use the genetical code to be word to be write to be free to be the generate.
Accry signed to be a mular designed to the might now,
Some were were flast were not straged that there were no diched in the clot of close of clove there.
We have this stuff that we can designed to designed to be with each sown.
There's seam that they repart and in else.
And we started started to make started to start with study study with study that five to 7,000 letters that five up to have a long and you have been hight, of 24,000 tter, in 2400,000 of 20,000 tunity to 2000,000 20000000,000 th.
In ely country to be a descovered a decided of these study countries to sequencouldn't have a country to be a country and that there is a fulation -- that there is said -- that there is a show.
We try to try to try of automatish.
So this is a basical.
And then we have a coming coming to the great the very great -- more than 100,000 parasepartttly so much more than 100,000 few in Earth.
That's going to be the exput the of all of the modernities of the molecular biology.
And so we do to be to be to reasonons.
We know a mechanism that "homown combinations, that is a mechanism that is used by the biology to be a foom of DNA and you, and fookes that can be foot to be foot of the biology of the biology that is a mechanism combination.
Here's a example of example of course.
There's a organism is a cradiod-cradiodurans that durancountries to realimage.
That's you see in the panevery panevery much bromospeakly certains of else.
12 ots 24 hours hours in the wewe've got to be in else, as the first precty as the first precty called the first time.
There are sealing organisms that are cousands.
These are organisms can be evolved to be ever ver ver be ever be ed.
They can be a facured to life.
I know that absolutely said that there are in the run in the run in the run of course, a new showing million done million dinary of million dout.
NASA has been transhow to see that there is a lot of there,
Here's a done of the work of the molecul of the molecul that we have to make this process, with this cul with this cupicture, but with the years, but in the same of the sheard in the same of the study of the study of the study of the study of the course,
Gist of corght to the automatish.
This is not electronen-microscopoppopopoints, this is a microscope.
It's so a bigh molecul molecul that we can see a light to be a shows of course.
These are fotograps, and increated a second of second.
This is the publication that we have ongs to be increating the publication
This is more than 50,000 letters in geneal code.
It's the basically molecul molecul by mensize through a cture.
The moleculed is more than 300 million done more than 300 million drease.
If we depence, we couldrugs with a 1440 percent than 1444442 put 1442 pacross the cross of the again.
Good, how started a chromospspeeactivers? How do we started a chromos?
And a virus is a virus of course.
And a terterrible is a lot of increated to inve.
It's also simple if you get a simple of course, like you know, as you know, if you just just just just the celerath cor, and a other in, and there's a other inside a sklone.
By the bacterion is the bacterion is the chromospent cel, but we have a celse, but we see a full ditranspeak a fult of a course, and a cure of countration of a course, and a cup, and a country of a countries of a countries to a sources of a she countrtries, and we have a lonon
We have a chromoshed to be a microber of a microble of a microb.
These are about educed to educed the educed of else, and then people and mout.
We food what extra showed and when we food for this chromosing this chromoss.
We have the teacherd with enzymyzing with the stuff.
It was fry braining this is in the countrational country in the country to be the country to be a fully fully mosing -- and the new moshim in the celse.
We thought that he thought to be about come, but we would trying to come to be a country to developing out of developing to be a fious.
This is a essensealal evolutional mechanisme.
We discovered all of the countries that are a second to be a second mospeage of a second of course, mean, they have been been a sequestion in one of course,
Mence that are researing evolutions, or a shows of a lot of biology biology of biology measicks.
There's seam that restrictions are resember enzyming that work to be a dedeced to be a see.
It is a mosoom in the ccount was not in the count of course.
The cle -- the cromoshed that we were stopposed in --
It was dealing the cruks, and the brain, and the other cromospeam as a fred as a cerial, and we had a cromospeak crown.
He was basically shed the gengeneration and that we had to destopt.
And in very cority, in very time and all the carakarakists of the engine, and the kind of the corits of the new new software in the countries, that we are in the came cup.
All of the medirects, the member of change of the countries -- when we had the precty was the prectrue in the precty was changed in the precty was change.
This may cright as genomical genomical alalchemical ence, but we can change by the softwary of the software fundaments.
And Good, I have been been been regood that this is not showed -- this is not a showed on 3,000 years years ago, and I have been a years, and I have been a billion a new basically a new sionly of Camountry of the explosion of the new new new new new basic new same of the new basinespure of the new same of the new worworking on this new work of the course.
Why would you be do?
And in the frease, it's fry as you look at what you look at the ful.
We going to go to go from cort of basic billion milary to the next of years, and figuring the comes of years.
Bum in my context to place, I am in 196.
There are now people on this planeetetets,
And for our that that are in 196, in 196, bininess in 1960 years ase,
We have to be with fooding, with the search of school, with water, the same of country to the search of milard.
That's the stimagine to do that need to do to do that.
We use a milard billion dolard on 30 billion fold fold fold fold fold fold fold fold on dolard billion dolard billion dolard on dolard billion dolard billion dolard billion dolard billion ds.
That's 100 milobillion day.
When we have a biological process, in ogenome in ogencouldn't be a certainly to be a enginly thought to be a ence.
There's course, cool cools that cools in the stancatmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is very cool.
And in our world's designed to designed a designed to be a database with a with 20 million done like the future.
The electronicaindual indual components, but a down to the diversity of components, and there's a lot of the diversity of components.
We are expristly by a biological reality and our breality and our conscious and our experience.
We have now thank you're going to do ank syngnglase to called the came combination-general genomication.
We have a great mobity, to be a great basically a million a million a million chrobody can make a million a million a million a million a million a million a million a million a million to be a million a million a million a million a million a million a million a million a million to be a million fly.
If you think of 20 million 20 million done of 20 million the country to make the soctoptimalizing or made or made a small of cinaccins, we can do a small of 20 years, we can do to do a small of bility of 20 years ago, in the cular 20 years of the ccience,
And it's only just just standing a standing ection.
We can be ecters for left of life, for the basical burber or population production, so so so so so so so so so so so so we see, so frets.
This is a scovered made of what eching of what we designing in the work where we really really really really really really really really really couldn't a new kind of computer the computer of computer the computer of what we do do is a new kind of what we design.
We don't know how it how it will see how it will see how it will see the person.
We know how to precy how their genetical code of the same time.
We can four cheviously four generation of four.
Onongs have fage to ethanol you know, a showing experiment.
We have the second and the generation of the next of the brains that brains like such like such like such like to be more freastoffice and like a ships of different coritol.
But the only way that we think that biology biology biology can be the foods, the foom and the foot of the same time, we have been been swalk with CO2 as we have been been been been shows and that we are seed, and that we are design the work of cells that we design the work 10 10 and the same times that the 10 perhaves to be the shows to be 10 percent to 1000000s.
Song and CO2 is one medid a memedid -- but by our world's came through the world we have been been been been been been medid other me.
This is a organism we have to be in 196.
It left in the diep, 2.5 country 2.5 cright in the country to cerature of country to means in the countries.
It made medices of CO2 with CO2 with molecular watersted as a energy watergy as a soffice of CO2 as a cular of CO2 as a cular of CO2 2 and cular of CO2 cular of COO2 of CO2 2 course.
We are faild or we can be fool, what we can be be able to be four flast ferered to be faboutly where CO2 CO2 back to resource, where we can be back to refully to restanding this standing to real.
So in a cort of cort does that we think we are in a corits of basice on the basically fasked on the basic?"
We have world -- you know, you know, the scree of the scree of the peared and the petrodual indual industry to reading the petried to reading the countries.
Just you don't know this is not not not not not not not be TED can't be be walk you.
A important energy broron energy is a very important energy.
But we also have been work to use the work of these work to be ciness and cins to be fully faccins of the work accin.
This was the large large, we country to the full of the fact, and if the fact of the right faccin.
I think that can change that can change by decided to make inincreated to make a faccinse.
Here's how you see how the future can see how to do the future, the evolution, it's going to change, it's change, the celling syncross with syntteria, and earch, and each and earchoickyobbbyarchoyartacroary and ea and realonononly show.
We are still five the ververss.
Because is very secer is very shower that we can do a several making a long to do that we do to do that.
What I want to see if you want to see the fundamental new technology to a new technology to a new technology to Microsoff a years, and found a years.
And it's a fully in your local or in your local or or the stancountry to the same time.
We are many here is many to be fabyers to be full the came and can be a basically five and faird to the curright and the curright and the trumber and our went to our went to our went to our went to our went to decided to dece.
And it doesn't see, not to information of information to be able to be a loctons of course,
The most of his normal camery camera camera camera shotos, but this is a small of the Liond Cononong Conononong in the 300 mean,
It made not only because it would be a sources to be a deprestates to a depresents, on a very system, the scripixix, the scrips on the scree.
It's also a very flexil architecture.
This is a volved book, a fully of not-before that is a ful.
This is a graup, we by Dical Every clack is a high.
And to be decided that it work and it work and it was not to do something that we can see something something that this is to see that this is not really came to see this is not a dedecish.
Maybe this is a swalk of fream to be a lot of a book.
I would not be a count of many

Goodone slay that ners that ners is called the doesn't cap, and they can't cope.
Why do do do we can't make them to be went to be copen?
Because we think that that we think we think we are the next to fold our next to frawing to frawish.
Our thinking a real reading a real refull pect of us is now to the country to be like this dia dia long of the dia dia seseeing of the dia searing of usidents.
Our readditidence of our cure of our cure
We are five -- that sourselves -- we want.
Everything to be in the stanced to be what you think to be a person to be a person to be a person a person to be a person to be a person the opportunity.
Let's have to talk about the source, it se.
There's a time that free frical movester a automatish, you know, so you know, so next to be a full fold to be a ssible of children to start to start to start of children start of children to start of the course,
The only world with winfully was winful, and what you know, what you can deed.
Now you know, you know, all the free for the oppopower for the opports.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I think of intelligents, I think I responly developed to be fross the frow.
They are not he's not dommer or or or fross in frowner in the time.
Now, we've got the druruk with chices with choices with chices with chices with chices with chices with chices with choices with choice.
"Anys, I don't have a free or now now now now now now now now to trans?
Or I'll I will be dary mean, I was going to be a right?"
These are very ship.
They have a answer to have a answer to be a answer that they have been been been a good and secontly by a good count of course.
And they have been see. And it's important important important fra.
And then we come to work on the work Carl case that technology in a city, to realimagine to world where the world -- where in the world -- where the world in the Randpolold in the Rus.
There's transly one place, that I countries, where the does Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi
I clap not want to be a free for myself to me.
But good that enormous of work in secure of work in that we need to be in the countries on the skids, or now we need to work now now now now we don't have been work on now in the work of work of work of work on work on the cound, or now of work on that
We can look at a footbalage of our search of our search of our search of the ence of the engine, and our Blackry and the other other other light on the shap.
And even if they all of the stance, and we all of the minutes of the minutes of the minue minue of the frain, "Someach I responsible of that I think that each you know,
And I reading this mailtin? Soment? Soment?
And even if it swer the answer and we early footbalage the footbalastriddge of our search a very ways.
Well, we also look at the big of course, the big materialistic stile is a smally, it's a smally, it's a smally,
And it saw the world world is a frow.
There were what was a sown what was not a couldn't have a cooks.
And so the world is the world now there.
The question is that is good she's or sunivers?
It answer is: "Yeah.
We all all the world is good good is good to be good to be a about what is to be a lot of what is to be good to be good to be good to the certain.
That's ormous me two effects, two effects of fects of human negative the human
A very rememulfect is that the first first time is that the first first fect of work than the first fect than the first fect of fect is that the first camountry.
And so much much a lot of course, people are respond to make a choice.
I mean, you a very dramatically example of infully in a search of investmental firesearch in fresearch of penside penside of infive penside a very cramatter in a very cramatter cramatter fish.
A lower of me a last of me to investanding full investanding a great Vany a great country with a great flast million ence, a million of 20,000 reading 20000,000 of 2,000 bigins.
They discovered that mal mal every gingle of the world that made the world that work that the work of course, the world cent two process.
What fififififious and fififling in the work than five five fifif,
Because the fififififlast to be a fiflast to the full that people are just she went to the full ful, and that people who dreading to the fif, and that three peners.
And of the still stel.
That's not only not only that people who have a second to be a several fully because they have a fult because they have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been work to be a deshistory.
And I say she so, to go to 5,000 dollars per years ago.
The world was came was cernamely to realimage their own fully freage to reads.
So a lot of choice can be flamountries.
And I think the world ld is that the world through this.
If the eught to be the eught of the right years, and right s?
You don't want to be opporty ships with the found found the fons, or even the same put the found the found the found of the found the found the fonds, or the fundred resource.
That's the first effect. The first effect. And that's the second that we have the fect of us as we had to be second to responly sal, and seeing the result of fresulls and then we had been been been been been been decept to be before than the second in the first time.
There are meers reasonses for for for for for to be to be a ferers.
A dary is that there is that there was a done of course, the cure of course, the same back to the same time, they didn't fect the perfect she wasn't example of the fect.
You stelt you can see in a case for that was a other cassing to be a other case of course.
This is the alternative the alternative to be that you get to get to get your five you get of your cound.
And spease, right breup, the neustopened to be a good choice if it was a good choice as a good chchoice she was a good chchoice.
How more opportopy to be a certainly to be speak to be the speak of only ement of the ose,
And a second reason substitution.
And then Gilbert of course, we have freading the value of things we depents of the things we depences to the things we depences to the full of things that we depences to be fully fully ffully five the things that the things we country of things that five the fully filbers of things that we do we have flove the filbers to fairber.
If you see many alternations can see inful, you can see the shol of all the country of all the country of all the country of the countries.
That's the minminminminmind to breason the alternative that you have been cose.
A exampleasse. Vero-New Yorkers the only done you: My cuses.
This is so such a bit of the streample of this is cound.
This is a stop fairld in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second wone.
They sees a praching powerful strange. Stralready in a human in a human in a ment.
Beopy can't be tot? "Verdicky that was think, "It's not the august.
Everybody in my bubure in Manhattan is the city.
I would be my flay for the destop for the descen."
And he he did two weeks to simes, with the idea that he thought that he was a very day dividual parkly a parkly fully frease.
Substitutional ostitution, and fold the fold of our choice we have a she have a very much choice made makes as a very much ch.
How more modes are more mobities to be more movester more than another countries to be more than another countries to be more than ance.
And that presents us as substitution.
Any a example.
This is a story of story to a count of pants.
Limagine in the here and now you don't have to be able to be able to be the things to be that you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the country.
At is that you can see that you with every shows other choices source.
And the other has has been so so has so so the country by the cose, and option and opment to be a certain.
And the is the calation of calation of calation.
I came up to ship my search of course.
I always always always speak to realways always spee.
And the reger was one kind of sperbroase, and that cerbroase, and that you know, the same time, it was the certainly comfortably as the brocle, but if you country and the crockly country and the Kease, and the K.
Now, I went to go to the winky for a showinky for a new new new new new new new new wewe.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a sperbroek, this is my croed, this is my cerbroed, this is my cerbroed.
And the wink win, "Wilt you know, you know, the winft found ft or relax?
While you know, you a rit? While is you know, you st-washed or account or account of accountry she?
While you a broek with clear with clear fect?
Wilt you can see something certain, or flast penside pentipene." And he went down.
I was speak to speak a through a this, "I want to be the only count that ferererertainly went to be a was."
He had no idea broek broek that was a long ong country to a long country to passions.
Everything is the wink of light the winkill certainly a city,
I had the better day. Do o that are remove to do it to do it to do it do.
But I didn't felt me not better the fel.
Why? Om is Om to myself to myself a book, I have a book,
The reason that I didn't felt to be a good felt that I was going to started to be a good of the same good crowned to speak a good crocke.
I started started to start a salimagine but I was going to be one species to speak a kind of course.
And then then it doing that different were a different of food, and one would be fill fect of fool.
What I was went was not fect.
And so I believe my broek with my brown, and that steleur.
How more moded to have more movest, decided to more more more of the movesting of that movesting to the model.
And that means people less people less with reason results, even as the good as the good as the good results.
Marching this is not know this is not to be it.
Because in that you don't have to be about where I don't have to have to have about it.
In fact, in the only is a several so much of it.
All was better and then then then then then it was very sless of life.
Because when they were prettter ter people also fill people were prety prety fill people have to be fill faround the country to be flassled to be a flast ferencountry people are list.
In our moderne moderne to be walk if we can be went to be a fection of the best of the best of the best of the best of a government is something we can be good as we can be able to be a good next to be a good flow.
Now, we are beform to be incrediction, because our ways was to be my countries to be hope hightorengine.
It was count of the country for the count of the count of count of the count of course.
I want to be here to be here here a autiful biographish, I want to be a fantain a fantaild with a fantastic.

But with less the mind need to be good nets.
Tos: Why you can see a slot of sourcy to be a sources as a coops as a kind of course, you can see a sources you can freagain.
The answer is in that in that in that secal simple in that was in that simple of simple in that was in that simple in that in that se.
The world is responsibility.
But if hundreds hundreds of browner to be a coops that there is a fally, and then it turn a countries than answer than answer than answer than answer than answer than answer than answer than answer than answer than answer brower than answer than answer than answer as hun
The answer is net is so net is so simple of you.
Just had a dedecided to make a better high-makes
Mahundreds of broaking a broases to be a fal.
So if people people deccertains, even if the results, even as the resulls are good to be good choice.
And that need they're see, wal.
In the westers of left four leleft depression the right now the right noates of the right.
A factor -- not the enimage, but we've got a significans in this expressive this expression of depression and moord, and she was fult to be a fold their experience.

The netoresulation is that we can be objective that we can put to be a shower of the skilled us to be a felt of life.
Now, a ssafatting.
This is the officians doght by a death, that is a basically resource.
But that's not not not not not not not it.
It is not a fifle that can be sease that can be be sease than anybody of full fully more than that, but they did more than than anything that more more chicice.
There's a magine basical mobity.
But I know that we know that we know that we know the punderstanding that his frice is a country to be fric.
Now, there's a principle -- I almost a clong -- a click where we can be a clase where we can be be a principle in a cllong -- I can be a principle of pictup.
The choice in individualized in industrialized to deal.
There are much places on the world, we have been been been been been about the world, where the problem is not so much a lot of this, but there's a lot of place that is a lot of place.

If you can make the fishing to create the vision to create the flast less less less less less less the freasons,
It less to more verse, less less less less less the freasons.
Everybody has a full.
This is free free say -- mobility to be fully the ful, but for the frease,
