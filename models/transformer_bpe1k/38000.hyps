Forial years, I showed these two slight of the last years, and that the pollish three million year, about the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent curved
But this is actually the reason of this specific problem because it doesn't show the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crach in the summer.
The next slide I show is a deceed, version of what happens in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is clearning in red.
And as you can see, it looks at darkblued.
That's the age ice of the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years or five years or parent, is almost like flowing in the body here.
In 25 years of this is going to get this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrate and there's a very large amount of warming carbon the amount of frozen carbon diased, when it designed by microbes in methane.
Compared with the total amount of responsibility in the atmosphere, would double that could double the core of the atmosphere.
In one of the understanding of the antial mes, in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey winter was Katey Walter of the University of Alaska of different team to another team to another team to another unep of undeep resember to another team to another team to another team to another team to another team to another team to another team of the University of the last to another team of the last
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be
A reason for that, is that this huge warmte-warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt of a single before
The water than ever ever before is ever bigger than ever ever ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuage in Southwest Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea leap of sea because it comes again, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These streams.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the South Pole, on the Earth.
And last months of scientists scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
Mear specific is the ice in the West the ice of the South Pole very quickly quickly a few of underwater islands.
The whole continent is six meters of six feet of the being sea legal continent of the fixed, like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass, there are now new now that are now a few years ago, which were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is going to get half of his drinking water of that smelt time.
In the Andes, this glass this glass of drinking water for this city.
There's more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also drowning the drinking water.
In California reduction of 40 percent in California of 40 percent in California of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you read read ready read it.
This global dramatic dramatic stye of forest fires of forest fire.
And the number of nature, of course, all around the world is ran incredible and never seen accidents.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the front gone in the front of the front of 75 years.
This pattern is completely impattern is completely impattern is completely intensible.
If you look at it from a historic context of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 hours --
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, and look at the eastern area of Stille Ocean, from America, west, from America, west, from America, west, there's a drastic drastic drastic dings in the oceans.
The only great warming causes of warming the Earth, next to 20 percent of the Earth, is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and step is a problem.
The United States is one of the two largest touch-footest with China.
And there was a proposal to build much more steals.
But we see a wrong time.
These are the voice cales that the bold that the building was annuleaved in the last few years and where green alternatives were represented to the past few years and where green alternatives were put in the last carbon of the past carbon the brow years and where green alternatives were represen
There's a political battribute to the country.
The cities carbon and oil-industire gave in 250 million dollars to promote cleaning to promote cleancy of cleance, which is a counter-opposed counter.
And that image me think that image me think that image of me think that image me.
And the current was in Tennessee, at me at the home of four billion liters of four billion ghtly point of believed moded month,
You probably seen the news face.
This is the largest of fires in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooling around the Kerstrial,
Video: "Frosty the voice guy is a black guy, up, soil,
He's fluence of fluence here in America, and he's worried in America, and he's growing that our economics.
Frosty the voice is cleans with the day clean.
He's paid and cutble and cutty cutty and cutory their job."
Here's a big part of the bunch of the cool in West Virginia from day.
The greatest minds of the country is the great bage of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me be clearly Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reme, they don't know what they talk about."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaign of campaign on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat-a-change threat.
That's the reason why the most important goal is to give a magic realize of advertising to the light and the reason the light of the truth of truth cup.
Fit is, step is not smartly.
We think it's clean, it's clean, and it sleep.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let's just get us to us.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern cleans clean.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of law.
But that's the sound of clean urban cools technology.
despite the fact that the fact that burning cities of the main causes of the Earth, change warming cleans of the Earth, change the Earth, change that you see all this.
Look good around, this is the clean urban technology today.
Al Gore: Eindemands the positive alternative alternative alternative of national security of national security of national security of national security of national security --
Video: America in crisis, America in crisis, the economy, the national security crisis.
The red wire in all of these bags, is our dependency of fossil fuels, like pole colls, as pole colls and inported oil.
But now there is a common new solution to get this out.
And further America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America plan that is a plan that safe safe that safe us and the warming of the Earth counter-today.
And the since of an enough to solve enough to solve our problems.
Rearpower America. Ontde.

If you want to go far far far and get together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Forg year, I gave an introduced an introduced the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I again. For those who were not going to be the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment ever experiment ever experiment ever experiment.
It has to do the circumstances that were present less than a billion a billion second the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition, so, this!
This is the machine of Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one I work. It's called the ATLATLASDDctor -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS. In building so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLATLAS.
That was a party of a party chamber.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all around the LHC and with the LHC HC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with particles in the detector of the LHC, and with a photograph of the LHC with a photograph of the LHC and with a picture of the LHC and and with operating particles that all the way the LHC, and with the photograph of the LHC, and it was a picture of the bone,
In other words, when we knew that picture photograph on 10 September we knew that the machine works, which is a huge winning.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the charge, or this, or then, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden habits of these golden week.
Those wear wears 13 thousand amper camper that the machine on ful,
The engineers will say, "Not that they're going to say, "Not that they're too small draden."
They can do that because they superceither are low temperature of temperaturs.
So at the min 271 degrees, you know, colder than the stars, the stars, who drags that wears that wearing power than the stars,
In one of the connections between the nine of the nine of LHC, sat a construction.
And that was something warmed the wire of it was a bit of electric weather and thousand amper characteristics.
This was the results.
This is still impression when you realizing you realizing that those magnets more than 20 tons of away, and they were about 30 inches of inches were moved to move inches of the realizes of the magnets that magnets more than 20 percent tons, and they were about 30 inches to get about 30 inches more than 20 inches were move.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have repair tools.
Now they are back to away.
Eind messing the LHC will be again.
We will put it again, and we expect measurements in Juniverse, so we can go to the outside of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who started the debate of the value of science. It's easily research.
I think it's so hard is that it's so hard to be so hard, the fact that we are going to be beyond the LHC.
I learned the last words on English scientist Humphrey Davy, and I moved the deceep of his teaching experiments of his teaching experiments of his teaching was his teaching was so dangerous than readvances of the human spirit of the human beings than regulars of science that there are no respiritive to completely that there are no resonsistans of our overs are completely definitione."
Thank you very much!
I would start to ask you back to your childhood and when you play with blocks and when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to understand how to go to grab and resolved and resolved by the way, you actually solve problems by learning the declining with and depended with the dependuring with and depended with the dependition.
Rumble insight is strong, because with the understanding the world to understand us.
As an information inspired by the way, by physical interaction with objects -- together with my advises with my adviseur Pattion and my computworker Jevantage -- I started asking a computer to use, what if we used a computer instead of that mouse increase as a kind of indicating engindicating with a place of bureaugments we can move with both indicating with both indicating information fy-fiels
and can orders and as we want?
This question to do this question that we decided that we decided to see a answer, by Siftables.
Corner is a Sifty of an interactive computer in a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can move each other, they can show them movement, and they have a screen and wireless contact and wireless contact.
The core catore is the physical traffickability, as blocks they can be moved by understanding to grab through it.
And the tables are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And so this resources have a more physical difference, aware of their movement, and even of their movement, and even of the way we movement, and even of the way we move, there are different new and fun.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sift's institute, to show a video to do a video to cancells and others and others and others and others played the back of the back legs of the realize of the reason is playing to play a video to play a video is played to play a video is playing to play a video to play
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And indicated next to each other, they will be interesting.
If they get surrounded and they can do this and can be able to do this.
And they feel movement and celling.
We realized algauw that one of the interesting consequencing this interaction, the using of all of the interaction, as it was a color as it was a color as it was a liquid as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid --
In this example of the example of Siftables and I can use them to go to a color in a leg to to go into a leg leave and I can use them to be mixed with a leg of the example of the example of the example of the picture, and I can use them to use color in a leg to use them to get color in a leg example of them to go to a lot
If we have drive to go back to what we return back.
There are some cleverage cleans for education, may game with language and logics with language and logics that we want to give people the capability to give people the captivity to see things so.
Here's a set of a Fibank of a Fibonacci of a simple calculating programmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmatic ship -- this is the development of a Fibonacci shows -- this is the development of a series of development -- this is the development of a slightly counter.
Here's show you a game that a cruep between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every raround a randomly letter to every Siftable, and give ormed words are controlled in a dictionary dicated words in a dictionary words are control in every Siftable,
And after about 30 seconds it is a very rescued to be rescued and appears a new series of letters with bilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in it to make it out of making it out to make a video of it.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost no instructions needs.
Everything you have to say "Make worden" and they know exact what they need to do.
Here's some other people at test of test of test other people at the test of it.
That's our young batta tester, right?
And it seems to be just the Siftable.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting shown.
We wanted to learn a platform for developing language
This is Felix that demonstrated in the demonstrates.
And he can new characters in the scene bringing of the scene with that characters of the table, with that characters of the table.
Here it sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he's got a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done than! Yeah!
And by shiftables and Siftables and the next to each other, he can leave the characters with each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it decided to decision.
Video: The catcatches away away.
DM: The last example I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, that we developed every Siftables and drue.
One of every one of them ariations, where you can choose what you want to do is using the variations,
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected to be injected to pattern itself.
You put a sound in pattern by the pattern by a living a leg Siftable live controlled live controlled of reverble as reverb and filter.
They are added to a sound and added by can't be counts.
And the general effects like tempo and volume like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's see a look.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a lead pattern, leaving a lead.
Now I put the basline here.
Video: ThM: Now I feel a little bit of slagwork.
Video: ThM: And now I couple the filter to the filter to the effect live live live to the effect live live to the effect live to the filter of the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can affect live live to the filter to the filter to the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can aff
Video: DM: I can accelerate the canes of the side of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo blocks.
Video: There I headlet the filter to the filter to the filter of the expression.
Video: DM: There is repeated the pattern while it plays.
I don't need to plann, but I can improvise to plann, but I can improvise, it just like I want.
With the end of the dims of the whole through the volume Siftly to can.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make new humans to make new human-computer interfaces that are straight have been voted better in the way our brains and bodies working and lichames.
And today I had the time to show you a new element in this design area design of course, with some possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the same to a very new generation to a very new generation to interact with digital media, which is the information to our world like we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you all with you put it with you.
I am write
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am not realready to be changed.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and careers in my life and careering my life and careering my relationship with my work.
It started with a book that I wrote a book that I have written a memoire, "Eten, Biddy, Biddy, very experiencing the whole world and a very international existence the whole world and an international existenced.
The result is that people are always anywhere I had to put me and always does anywhere I was doing it.
What is what -- it's called that.
People come to me and ask me and ask sure you and ask you say, "Don't you afraid that you can never ever ever even?
And if you don't you keep your whole life will keep keep being a book will be a book publish that people will be heat where people will be hearm for warm to be hearm of warm that people will write heavy that will be heat that time?
And if you don't have a afraid for that?"
Every single reasonably you know you.
Of course, that would be very well. But I remember 20 years ago, I was when I told a teenager, when I told I wanted to be write I said I was write to be write that I wanted to be a teenage of 20 years ago, I was going to be a teenagine,
People said, "Don't you afraid you never get success?
If you don't see the decision, that you will go on through it down?
And if you don't you afraid you live to this work on this work without of this ever being something that you will dealt on the public fail?"
Something in that streting.
In the short comes to my answer questions of this questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called the things are called
Alwaways all the time.
But I also am for a lot of other things that all of the things that all of it.
For sea weet, for example, and other end, and other end,
But what I am write to write myself the last time that that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody is to be afraid to be afraid to the work for the work for their opinion on Earth are they put their opin?
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make sure to creative processes, something that we have been put in a little bit of a work what's going to do something that is not happened to do something in the other kind of work too work on the earness,
Take my father. He was clearning engineer, and I can't remember that there was a question of it ever asked him or he didn't have any of him or he didn't have any of it.
And this is what John, "John, how it is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, so it was not worried about it.
And to be fair fair through the equal engineers have also not the reputation of the edge of manical-depressive alcoholists of manicalcoholists of it.
And the right writers well, they have such a reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have bluedly reputation of the reputation of being instability to be instability to be instable.
Look at the core dead of the most magnifical mind under the most magnifical creative minds of the 20th century.
Many fairly young, often by own own own own own to do it.
And even those of those who are not suicide of suicide of their gave under their gave to be own.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of exciting of this kind of basically we don't see anymore.
We've all heard and heard it and have heard and have accepted it all before.
The case thought is that creativity of involativity is involutes and that a artist, and that a artist, an artist, and that will lead to elling the equivity.
And so I want to say everybody here today, asking you say, "Are you life?
Finds you see OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I don't think I think of the way I think of the way at all.
I think of the realize.
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see that this century.
We can creative mind a lot better to live better to live and live.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark thought of dark life.
See of the phase where my careering is now realize now is now.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper fix years.
I can work that I can work four decades.
Haviginally will be what I published now is going to be seen published by the outside work that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends on the other, so I can lap you know, so I can lap it likely to be likely to me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think of that, you know, you're going to be nine hours to the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the wor
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after long after long after a conclusion that I can just go through with writing a psychological protection in the process in.
I have to write a safe distance safe ast, and my overwhile, and my overwhat's very understanding and, very understanding publishing publishing publishing publishing publishing to the responsecurrently during a safe distance in a fairly few descript of the responsing
I have been looking at ways of past year, to ways to ways do that.
I have down in history and have retail me, and have me deep of other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My quarters has pulled me brown to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let's op, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins people didn't believed that creativity was coming from themselves.
Men believed that creativity was a garble mind that creativity was a faul, unknowledge place to humans were unknowing and unknowledge.
The Greeks call these tremendous mind of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that demand influence.
The Romain the Romeins had a bit of a bit of idea.
And in the called them called a geniused to a genius,
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, is a particularly pienterer person clearning pienternal person clearning is that the Roman is not a particularly piently is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their political distribute a kind of magical entities that have been ophiiated in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the househ.
If the artist, the past of the work, purposes assistance.
And the same being work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about the earlier protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be work.
The artists was so in protection to the protection of the narcism.
If you got a brilliant brilliant there.
Everybody knew that is an invisible genius,
Well, you know, you get crace, then it doesn't just read that not only you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genius.
Long time that the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything.
There's a whole new idea: the individual humans is the individual humans is the universe and mysteries.
No space to mystical creatures, regard from the dival world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely came from the individual.
And for the first time in history was talking about artists became said that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I think I have a big wrong faile.
And to be one person, one person is to set of individual, believe that he or she's field, the course, the source of the century of the century of everything that did is to family of the family human piece, and it's a family for a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks somebody asks the sun in slike.
Egos are blown to huge proportions and there are unimaginable to be incredible high-expectations of prestations to prestion.
And I think this pressures the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists decade.
And if that is, and I think that is that I think is the question, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the parently,
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism not unforforward a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably people who are in the audience people who tribute in the audience of the idea that have been certain pull creatures of the fact of the work of artists of artists to inspiring heights of the work of artists artists in the audience of artists in the audience of the idea that are primary of the few edits
It doesn't seem to get me to get you all of that.
And I mean, I wonder it.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought to next the thought of the way?
It cutting so much as much as all the other explanations of the total explanatibility that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided to the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something that has been trying to create -- so in fact -- so in fact that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process -- you know, the creative process of the creative process of the creative process -- you know, the creative process -- you know that the creative process of any of anything.
That sometimes almost paranormally intension.
I have recently, the great American closer Ruth Stone meet meet meet of Ruth Stone meet meet of the great American closer of the great American closer of amazing American closer of amazing American closer of Ruth Stone of the great American closer recentons.
She's going to be in the nine. Her whole life all life all of life.
She told me about her jeught on Virginia.
Sometimes when she was on the field, she felt a poem of close to the country.
It was, so said she said, along wave air, as if there was a great wave air.
Soposed golf poem golf than the country to her.
She felt that the ground of her feet, and she was started shaking her to shake that point her on that moment to do is stonly one thing to do is to she wonder her lifetime.
And she ran hometers followed by poem and she had to see them as possible and paper.
When the poem through her her came to write waves her only to write it.
Sometimes it wasn't quickly.
Then run, but run, it's not run, it's not a house.
And in the moments set up with her her her home, searching about the fields, search -- in her words -- in her words -- to another power.
And also, I think about it, I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they almost any close to the close of the story -- they almost mistake.
And then she was in home looking for paper and paper and paper and poem through its its it.
Juist on that moment she had a pencil of pencil
And with her other hand, so told me she poevice she poem the poem of the air.
And she picked up with his tail, and pulled it back into her body and back it back in her body and wrote it back and wrote it back up the poem of its rescue.
In those case came up with the piece of case in the case of paper and then in the case order.
When I heard that heard, I thought -- what happens to be able to be so forth of my creative process.
This is what my creative process is not a medium! I am no medium!
I am a mile, who are every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans it with blood, sweating and trans represents.
But even in that daily customized that day I had such an experience of experience.
You know, you will also know that you can know that feel that there are creative ideas in your break of a source that you can identify impossible you can identify impossible of you.
What is that for source?
How can we use it without without we have become crazing?
And one way that we have good for us?
The best contemporaine example of this is what I can think I think is musician to be musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the store about this.
And in fact, a great part of his life have been shown the showed of his life of the aware of the same artists that results from all power, to get to the unition impults that resources in him.
With the years, Tom a little rough.
And one day he reflected in Los Angeles about the speeas, and changed the process of radical.
And as he realized that he realized a fragmental of a melodie.
It decided to do it like inspiration that is doing cust, understanding of it.
It was a beautiful good, and he wanted to be the hold of the hold.
But that went down't.
He had no paper -- no paper and no piece, no tany paper to them.
The amazing exciting exciting excited to him: "I realk the melody is remains it remains me eech.
I don't am good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't refully in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sture?"
"Think I really said I can be a song of the song,
If you really want to get this song is coming out of it.
Now, you don't know anybody else is falling fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohent." And from that moment was walking very different.
The work is the same thing that is the same thing with the known familiary suburbance.
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him reduced him when he distanced the creative of genius.
It was geniused to close on the skin and livered only and livered only to close it.
Tom realized that there was no reason it was not reason through to go through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizarre cooperation between a conversation between Tom and the own aspect that didn't really be allowed from Tom himself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I have already put up of it.
I was writing in the writing of Ets, Biddy, Biddly.
And I think of case I have in despair.
You know that well: your work is not good to be a very book, and you think it's a terrible disastrikes a terrible disastance.
Not just bad of bad bad, really terrible bad of bad.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that I was going to be a whole thing to do is to be a power.
I wished from my manuscrips and I focus and directly to me to a leg of the room of the room.
And I said hard-heard says, "Listen then, we know everyboth is not only through me.
You can see I have everything in me having in the benefits I have in me.
More can't give it.
And if you think it has to do better can, you have to do this.
Stack you not, right? That's rough thane.
I just write write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are failed that again, you know, it's just on the office on the office of the office ago."
Tja--- United comes up here.
Eures came up in the North African desert people to dance together to dance in the North African desert music.
And at the back and hours and hours and floors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes a lot of extraordinary extraordinary happened to be a particular thing.
One of those dancers was than transcening it.
You know what I mean, you know, you also seem to do with you, you also see you ever see anything that is to a performer.
It was like the time silence and the dancing and the dancer through a poriginate.
He does nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights of nights of the thousands of nights of nights of nights of nights of nights of the thousands of nights of nights of nights of the thousands of nights of the thousands of
And suddenly seemed to be a longer only a human being.
In him, under him, above him, above him.
A fired fired fired through it.
And if this destian destrop of people who had the Dan they started clapping and clapping up in child, and call the time, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical fact: Too the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spain, they brown this just tile with it.
The question is realize by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah," in "Ole one."
That hear you today today and flamengodness, flamengodances.
And a put artists in Spain, or magically does, "Allah, other, fully, "Allah, other, Allah, ful, broa."
And, understandable, souldn't a glimpse of God.
Precipies what we need.
Lastil is that the dancer that the dancer is discovered that the following of dincluding the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning charge disease.
At that moment is he's going to be a little older man with depently customers that will never come to such a set of either than any of the high.
Maybe never going to be anybody God to have dance,
What does it now to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show you for a creative mind.
But it doesn't need to be so painful need to be so painful
And imagine not going to be able to get the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of yourself.
And imagine you believe that you have a while, you know, a while,
When you get you ready around it. They get give to somebody else.
That's what it is properties to do is considered everything.
I depend up with instances that thought of this.
The last months I worked on a book, that is going to be able to get in short of a long reach reach to a lot of reach reach reach of the case months of the last months of the case months of the last months of the last months of the last months of the corn.
The result of that illuster progress.
And if my thought with me on the hands of my mind, I love and I went and the same for, I don't know whatever it doesn't affor.
Doo just do you work.
And just the thing you just do you do this, whatever it is.
If you task you task to dance.
And when the goddary geniused to decision to decision of your work on enil of the wonderful source of the wonderful source, "Ole !"
Then not, then, dance then, thance of this.
And also then, "OK."
I believe that heart.
"One of whatever we have a pure human love and owned by human love and owned by legaccessness,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: OK!
You know, I have already talked about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean to do is meaning, and what that mean, and the discovered.
We actually start from a new point of point we were the biology to the digitalize, and try to try to go from that digital code to a new phase in biology to go to a new phase in biology to design life.
So we've always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And what I think I tried to understand what have tried to understand on different levels levels levels to understand on different levels of biologists are trying to understand "What is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand on different levels of living?" "is something that I tried to understand "What is
We tried different approaches of approach, the back to minimagine.
We're now almost 20 years of the digitalizing right now.
When we have sequenced, the human genome ced, it went from the analog world of biology, to the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask to ask raining live, or can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a kind of smallest genome in a laboratory laboratory in a laboratory --
And we tried to see if we tried to a non-smaller genome.
We can take in the order of the 500 or shows of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relatively relatively simply with the onony.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get piece of the piece of the piece of the things that we can probably living cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell of the genes that would be able to be able to make a lived cell that would be a living cell lived cell that we can get a live cell of the gen
We decided that the only questions that the only questions to synthetic so that we could have the components to synthetic components to be so that we could have a few of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we have a chromosome, "Can we synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic solightist of asking questions are starting with questions of as well.
And the chemistry the chemistry of the molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, can start a chromosome?
A chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelerating on exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code, but it's just giving a lot of slowly, but it's taken realized to be a lot of course,
And our last point would be the moment would places on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a few stage of stage, to start with a bio-ethic tory tooling for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult is.
There's tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, so the longer you make, the more longer you make the capture.
So we had to do a new method of the society of these little pieces and corrating all the mall pieces and corrators of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempting with the digital information of the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that death.
We designed the pieces, did the wrong correction,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria cornal code reading and the bacteria of the genetic code and make viral particles went to make a piece of the bacteria cump of the bacteria piece of the exciting particles when we read the exciting
The viral particles were cells, they came out of the cells, they came back after that, and then the E. coli.
I was along in conversation with the oil, and I said they were model but already too good snails.
They laughing more than you.
And we think this is a situation where this is a situation where the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassettty cassettty of viruses, so we could close the cassettty cassettty ...
to understand what the real realize actually components of a living cell cell is a living cell area of life are actually coming the characters of a living cell components of the real components of a living cellent cell of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that it has to be very digital information is very accurave.
When we first first put together this genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard per 10,000 baseparated per 10,000 baseparating per 10,000 baseparated per 10,000 baseparated this genome of the first fault of the standard in 1995 was the standard of the standard in 195 periments.
And finally, we found after 30 resequencing 30 errors -- if we used the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start out and start started to start to start to start to start in the way.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters long that have to go over the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so they can design so that they can design so they can design so that they can go together.
We design here unique is unique of this.
Maybe you read that we have read water market that we put water in stopping.
There's a four, we have a four-letter code: A, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of codes for back 20 aminoses -- that there is a long-cup.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentence, sentence,
And the signs we only called "We're just a messing of it.
Some of them were teleurges that there were no poems were not poemmit that there were no poemmmits.
We have been designed these pieces that we can eath them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they put and they put and in each other.
And we started making pieces of them and pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long, pieces of 24,000 letters, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, until 72,000 letters, to 72,0000.
In every stages we could cut a confluence of these pieces of these pieces because we want to create a process of process because we want to create a process that is very robust.
We try to achieve the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of this as a basketball of this is a basketball of this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces of the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparates -- then they don't grow easy more in E.
That is the exciting of all modern tools of modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to rade other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologists recombination called biology to repairs to repapers, that pieces of DNA to repair that pieces can feed a piece.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million rad rad to ray engame.
And you see that in the upper panel, she just clear, she just clear.
12 hours later, he put it back up to each other, exactly as the first time.
There's thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely dried are completely dried
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can be moved to move, that can find a new aquatical aquatical environment.
NASA has been show that there is a lot of of them is there.
Here's a real microphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually yesterday with the right design of the pieces that we did in it.
Gist making sure they automatically say,
This is not an electronen-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we have recently,
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of ever molecule, with a clearly structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million of this.
If we would deplot of the 10-points letter, without spations and letter, then there's only to pressures to pressed.
All right, how do we start a chromosome? How do we activate?
With a virus is clearly easy of easy.
With a bacteria is it much more complicated.
It's also simpleer if you provide under eukaryots, like we just get the cell and does another in, and then you get a different in, and that's what you know if it's clong, and that is what you know if it's clone.
And in the bacterials of the bacterial species in the cell of cell, but we show that we show that we show that we show that we have a complete transplant transplant to a full transplant to another, and activating a cell transplant to another,
We have a chromosome.
These are about as far from each other, as people and mice.
We put some extra little extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome of the chromosome of the primary
We have the devailing with enzymes to make all the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will put the very advanced graphic images -- the new chromosome of the cell.
And we thought that he would come to show you would come to develop the process of developing a process.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of these kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the third of thousands of properties that they three thousands of properties in one time of the species.
People who proposed evolution evolution to change a lot of biology have not much biology comes to be a lot of biology comes evolution.
There are enzyms that are called DNA called DNA real.
The chromosome, that in the cell has not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever --
The cell -- the chromosome, well, we stop -- well, well.
It was expresses and recognize the other chromosome of chromosome, and then it was a strange of material, and then we had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was stopped blued.
And in a very short time away, all the characteristics of all the characteristics of one species and completely completely in the new species, and completely in the new software that we had stopped in the cell we had stopped in the celebrating of the new species,
All eggs, the membrans of the mbrans -- when we change the genetic code, it was changed.
This is a massive alchemist, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Already of the Camble of this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a break billion years evolution, and I have been paid that we maybe we may be almost a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this digital design on this digital design on this digital design --
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to take from six-en-on-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There's three people on these planets,
for each of us that lived in 1946; within 40 years, that will be four there.
We have a moved with food, with food, with cleaning water, medicine, fuel of a six-and-and a half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine ine nine ine for nine e.
We use five billion tons of colls, more than 30 billion collect other.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the any process to replace that is to replace that is to replace a huge challenge.
Then of course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And though our worldwided of our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had just a dozens had a dozens components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of that.
We're pretty limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have this technique fastly synthesions to do called combination called combination generating called combination general.
We now have the possibility to build a million chrobot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the dection of 20 million different genes of the way or trying to optimize octan, or trying to optimes, new vaccines to producing octan, new vaccines, then we can change a little team molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard standard of selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design design software where we work on work, so that you can really go to the computer and a new kind of computer.
We don't know what it will see is going to be there.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of it.
We focus on four on generation.
One of you see the grain of the ethanol of you see, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come in, as sugar, as sugar, sugar, as sugar, as a different fuels like octan, or different butanol.
But the only way we think biology biology can have biology without the food price of making higher and the available of available to get as we start with CO2 as are food as we have been designed with CO2 as are food designs that we think we are going to do the first food, and we think we think that we have the first fired generation of 18 months about 18 months of the any of the foods.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea -- about 2.5 miles deep cooks, with cooks,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at CO2 we can take cO2 is to take a little through through pipelled to get to factory to factory where CO2 is becoming back to the fuel of fuel -- to stye this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to expand we think we are able to expand on the basal question, "What's life?"
We actually have realize -- you have the case of the purpose to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED can do, where it does?
A important energy source becomes around
But we also are using these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools are now to think of these tools to think of these tools to do right now.
This year, there was a flu -- we just walking a little behind the facts of the course vaccine.
I think that can change by combines from testing vaccines of the combines of combines from a texts.
Here's how you can see the future of it can see evolution that the evolution is going to change the future, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're already removed from humans.
Our goal is to certain to make a long enough to survive long enough to do that may be able to do that may be makes to do that may be makes you may be a long enough to do that may be a chance to be a long enough to survive that maybe we can make a long enough to survive long enough to do that ma
What I want to show you a new technology is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have a cattributed. This is Sedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can get local or on immense amounts of visual data can work data can work or any data can work or on the distance of visual data can work or on the distance of you have local data can work or on the distance of you can work or in the distance of the distance you have loc
We look at many gigabyts, and we can see many gigabystical images and made the sort of seven in and experience, and then may be the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the big, the large of these collections or images are images or images are imagins.
Most of this is that most of this normal camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of this normal reached here.
It all doesn't matter of anything because the only thing would be affect the prestations of the prestations of the screen system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image of data.
This is a graum of Dickens. Every collecture.
And to prove that it's actually too, and not a picture, and not imagine, we can do something that this really text is really a text of this is really not imagine.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic, example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part of the part.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or capital of a medium.
We also done with the corner of this extinue of the Guardian.
We made a nep adversisished of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising extra information information information in.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technological specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of accumbing the screen of accumbing the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other other subjective -- not necessarily will be now -- not necessary will be necessarily -- not needs that this is not going to be necessary that this is not needless that this is not a pop-ups more and other subject of the pop-ups of h
Of course, of course, is a fairly applicating for a technology like this, I will not spend a time to do this one, except that we can contribute this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And on the top of a picture of the NASA of NASA .
Now let's look at something different.
This is a married live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web; you can see it look at the Web; you can see it a look at the Web; you can look at the Web; you can see it on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the attack.
This project called Photosynth, who connected two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snah, promote of Washington, promoso to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz at U.W.
And Rick Smyiski at Microsoft Research. It's a beautiful continuous.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been broads of these images have been coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of the stabilized diashws of panorama and panorama and all these things are space are space to a lot of these things are space space to a bit of these things are space being space -- and all these things are all these things are space are all of the computer.
I don't know sure or there is another environments.
There are more commundanger.
I want to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynthems that we work this summunicated came to the communicating what I have in my head is the realm of this technique of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to do with the advice with the advices and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dell Dell with imagins Flickr. You just sweeks in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such the campus and so the campus and the campus and so you get imagins of the Notre Delection of the Limages of the Notre Delection of the Leah, and you just sweep this --
And each of these orange is gives an imagination of this model in this model of model in this model of model in this model part of this model in the part of this model in the picture.
And so this is all of Flickr pickr that are pictures, which are in this way.
And we can get on simple developed navigate possible wise of simple wesceil.
You know, I had never thought I ever thought I ever thought would work at Microsoft of Microsoft of the Microsoft of you know I ever thought I ever thought I ever thought I ever thought I ever thought would work at Microsoft of Microsoft that I ever thought I ever thought I ever thought I would work to Microsoft that I ever thought I ever thought Microsoft of Microsoft that I would work that I ever thought I ever thought would work to Microsoft would ever through ever through ever
It's too overwhelming here.
I believe you can see that this many types are cameras is cameras we have a lot of grid to mirror cameras, a great number of it.
I will try to find some strange imagine.
There's so much of seen faces and such like this.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Delebrate also good is also good by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things that we really can do with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the whole of the whole of everything to each other.
All of these pictures are encounter, and shapes together a lot of larger than the parts.
You have a model that from all Earth of the Earth earth of the Earth eas.
Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use and also the benefits of people who use it.
Their photographs are being substance of metaphorrived somebody else.
When somebody would like to click all of these sacres and their names and their names and their names with all of the Notre Day, and I can use that that metaphor, and then I can use like a access of anyonce and creating a photographs, and create a helmetype of cross-modal, and create a little bit of cross.
And of course, the me-product is a rich virtual fashion of this immense virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from airline photos, satelling images is directly, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are devided by everybody can get all the images that can get decide?
BAAA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovering.
And the creates to your wish, hyperperperpicians of imaginations.
And it does that basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that is excited exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of these information that are very much of these imagins.
When you see you search for the web searches of imagina search of the picture, and the texth page of the imagina lot of information about what the imagina result of what the imagina result of the imagina is a lot of information about what the imagina is that you have a search for the imagina is that you give a search, and the text of the picture.
What if you now that are conceived to all your imagination?
Then the number of the understanding semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that comes to that comes from that comes gigantic networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of research and of edness is the possibility to live between them who are the ancient habits that are not forget to the ancient wind, the profits of the wind, the productors of policish, the productly stone, the product in bitters.
The science Jaguar-shamans still revies, or that the Milky galaxy or reminds of Instead, or that the myths of Instead, or that the Himalaya bood-hunt jait of Dharma, remember remember of Dharma, remember read-opening opology of anthropology in a absolute sense, but it's not a model of moship, but it's moded moship of the world of mode,
the consequence of a reset of adaptation, the result choices that made our ancestry ago.
Of course, we all shared the same adaptting realists, Brength: Worlds. Brents are born in the world.
We all all put induction rites.
And so, because of the individed of the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dance and art have dancing and art have the art of the art of this.
But interesting is the unique cadancadancy of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to reissue the Penan in the walk of Borneo, or the Vood-acollions in Haiti, or the freedoms in the Kaisut-batch or the Cara-bya-basically in the Andes-basically in the Saharan -- this is the guy with the Sahara month, a month, of the whole of Qomanger -- or now a month, a money -- or a money -- or a money of Qomangma,
Everest, the god-in-mother of the world.
They all learn us all that we can think we be think different, differently, differently --
If you think about it, you can just give this idea of you just give up to hope.
And together shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet and it's biosphere.
This cultural life-web as a bit as a edge of eth.
The cruster cutting up as the total of all the cornal thing, dreams, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, and inspirations that are breagments of the imagination of the imagination of our consciousness.
The cnosphere is the great nalatence of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and already that we can be able to be amazing curious curious species.
Not like the biosphere, is the eeth, is the eeth, and in many greater matter.
No biologist would take a biologist that least half of all the kind of extinction of all species in the point of extinction is not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptical scenario comes in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is loss of this is the loss of this.
And then everybody here are born born born of these are born talking on Earth speaking on Earth producate.
A language is more than a word or her grammatic rules.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the vehicle of the value of every unique culture, the material world reach.
Every language is an ewish, a thought of mind, a disingle disingle of spiritual possibility.
And from that six-thousand language today half of thousand language half of children are flistening in children flistening in children are flistening languages today of those sixts,
They are not longer longer to be learned babies of babies are not longer longer to be more longer to be more longer to be learned babies of babies not longer longer to be drager longer to be taught longer to be longer longer to be a longer longer to be babies of babies not l

Popt that is somebody's benared state every two weeks of the state of the earth, because every two weeks dies of the last letter-field, the last letter-fairly died language of an old language --
And some of you say, "Well, you don't have better the world don't have better place as we all have the same language of you, "Super, let's take Yoruba take take take. Or Kantone."
Or Kogi." You just realized you realizing the way it would not be your own language to speak language
So what I really want to do is take you today is taking you on a short journey by the eating nosfer that has to be lost a picture of what is lost of what is lost to be lost of what is lost to do is lost to do today.
Many of us forget that when I talk about another way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different ways.
For example, this Barasana child in the North West Amazon the anaconda, the people believes of the anaconda, that they believes the melcrach cording to the sacred of sacred snast, in the benefits of sness.

One of the phase of the fascinatory tribes that I have read the Waorani in North Ecuador, a remaining completely in 1958 follows contact was a fascinated in 1958 followed contact of the fascinated with the phases of the fascinating of the phase of the fascinated tribes of the phaled in 1958 perify phase of the fascinator,
In 1957 tried to explained five missionariss, but they made a critical phance.
And the air stream they pictures from itself to our idea's friendly bars, where they go to our idea's friendly ever a two-dimensional image image view.
They were talking about the pictures and tried to find the face behind the face.
When they found nothing they found the dun, they were the dunil they were dunderstanding with this.
But the Waorani not only extracts, but also the extracts, but each other.
Fiftile percent of their death came from borations.
We could have genealogies back to eight generations back to eight generations that we found two case of a natural death of a natural death general.
And when we put through the earning of parently died that one man ever died any of parently died by the way, but by the way, they had a connection. But at the same time they had a connection.
Their hunters could put hunters on 40 passes and tell you which is the animals, and tell you what species it was.

What foodo, the foodo, is the living is the living and kill the lives and kill developed the lives and kill the deaths.
The lives bars of the mind.
The mind of the minds can be represented from underneath the Great Water, answers to the thank of living time, the soul of living time, so that during the following of the following is the god.
And so that's why fairly food, "You're going to be any of you go to the church and talk about God.

This included with the day that she was outside outside and for the first time and for the first time, if they are 18 she says a 18 she says that clear point of the first lights, if the Sun lights of the first lightly conscious lights, is that they have learned to be abstract with her lightly in full glorial. The priests saying, "The priests say:

And it's the realize of you. It's realize to you." They call themselves the older itself.
And then we are the younger brothers, which are the younger brothers, which are the destroy of the world.
And this is a very important.
And if we think of indigenous people, and landscape, we often think Rousu seau and the old fability of the epartical wildlife is an idea that racistic in his simplicity in his simplicity in his simplicity.
Or we get Thoreau and say that these are closer to the Earth are than we we are.

It is basically regularly intuition is basically conscious intustants, because of the lives of the results.
What does that that mean? It means that a little child from the Andes, which is growing up with the faith of a spirit will be a fundamental other relationship is going to lead from a small child will have a little child of Montana, opposed to be growing from Montana, opposed to mine the idea that the mountain, ready to mine.
Or it the lives of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that keeping the resources of the individual world, of natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capes.
That made me a different humans than my friends of the Kwagiuth, who believe that those forests boses, who believe that forests forests are north of the Hemel and the Kroms and the cannibal minds that are in the north of the world.
These mind his important in their Hamatsa-in-basic.
And if you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities can create a bit of their extraordinary extraordinary discoveries. And take this plant. Take this plant.
It's a picture I jumped april in the North West Amazonone.
This is aya-huasca, the most powerful psychoactive reaching the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayage is fascinating is not only the farmacological potential of it. It's just how to do it is. It's built of the farmacological potential of them -- it's built of two sources.
Enerners is a woods, there is a lot of that better and harmaline in its walk and harmaline in its walk and light hallucinating works.
If you take only take the plant of it that a blue resky regulars by your drives your drives of consciousness of consciousness.
The plant is mixed with leaves of a coffee of a coffee become, Psychotria viridis.
The plant powerful tryptamines, naudicating tryptonine, dicumbrain diathyltryptamine, 5-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methyltryptonine,
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they snore substance of different species that are also substance of methoxydimethyltryptamine of methoxy?
That pooder your nose, is like a become shot of a become shot with barokay, to country to country to country to country to country of the reality; it design the ship of reality; it designed with baroks,
I tried to tried my professor, Richard Evan Shtes, to convince -- a guy who discovered the psycheded by his psycheded by his 1930s.
I mean, this tryptribute that these tryptamines were hallucinating, because when the effect his insted, because when the effect his intract to experience the hallucination, and then they are not realized to experience. Tryptamines are not oral oral oral to be designed by a symeans of human dark in the human darking.
They only get oral to be entirely with something that the monoamine of the samine of the samine.
The fascinating is that the basic carbolines in the limble monoiced monoown to the tryptamine-suppressers to activate the tryptance. Steeds the question: How can do this in a flora of 80,000 planties of two morphological varies, which are combined a biochemical farms that bigger than the same sales that the same bigger than the same s?
We say euperist "trial and ror, which is like meaningless, which is like meaningless.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us." What is that data Deeans that data Deayage is 17 variants of ayaca, who are all the great distance of aya-distance of ayage distance as a single species would be identify in our eyes as one species of the case of the case of ayagainst us.
If you ask their taxonomics in the candle of their taxonomics, say, "I thought you knew something of plants say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
You know whole all the way at all.
And it turns out you can hear all the 17 of the full moon in a full moon in different totally singled in different totally sings.
You try not moved with Harvard, but it's a piece of boot than guns countly booking.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is even those sympathy of us who are sympathy seeing indigenous and show you as curious and show you realize the history of the history of the history of the world, meaning our world, meaning our world, dealing our world, dealing our world, dealing our world, down.
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded will be reminded to be the war or technological innovations, but earlier as the era time of the time that we were standing the mass of the mass of biological and cultural diversive and cultural diversy diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always part of the things that are always to a dance of life as possibilities.
Techtechnology is also the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Sious to be Sious, when they gave their pile, and boat the boat as well, as the Americans are stopped Americans and they gave their horses and ways purposes and way.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eating factory of the eating nosphere is power.

What you look at the world, you will notice that it's not the lock of these cultures to represent.
These are dynamic living people, whose existences by identifieable forces that are powered to their adaptational powers that are powered reach reach of their adapts.
Or this now is to care of the field of the Penan, a nomadical of Penan, a nomadical south Asian addition to the forest, and reduced with the result and now reduced to the rivers, and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers are seeking of Borneo Chinese Sust-seeing Borneo Chinstance South Treaders Chinese Supyarders waway.

And one day they got a day per unhappiness on a Mao. For this over-fix years of a desperate of them seven years of desperated for seven years of courseven,
The pain of Tibet can be unbasically realized mind of the people, but the light of the people.
And finally, the way it comes up on a choice.
What will we have a gray world of a live, or we want to live a colorrrich world of diversity or diversity unity?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead said she was that she was peace that we direction.
We would not only see the human imagination are limited to a smal, modally thinkader, but we would have also many other options that there are other options of them are also existenceed.
We can feel our humans to feel that our species of the idea that our species is about 1500,000000000000000000000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our agricultuts, where we gave our replace to the cular of the shaman became the shaman was replaced by proza prozero and we shoes through specialization was only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface this is not the idea that we have all the answers of the idea that we have all the answers of the questions that will have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to ask of humans are asked to 10,000 different votes of the world they have with 10,000 different votes of the world are every much of the world to 10,000 different of the world to say the meaning of people, they have to answer,
And it is that song that we have reinty re-discovered the possibility to be what we are, a folk of the work of the work of all the work and all the gars of the garbagnity.
This picture I have on the northern point of Baffin Island genomes, when I went with Instead, when I went with Instead.
This guy, Olayer, Olayer, told me a wonderful.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Invent. In the 1950s they were to reality, to figure our sools, in the correctly,

In 1999 gave the Canadian government of California and Texas a piece of country greater than California and Texas Texas Texas Texas Nunavue.
It's independent area. They rescue all the resources.
It's a amazing example of how a nation-state engineering to her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly clearly -- at least for whoever it is tools of the world is not realize that she really doesn't get far all the way from the world is not away away.
They're somebody's homebody.
They are going to be in the way of the human imagination, which are going to the beginning of the time. And for all of us will all the dreams of these children, just like the oney, part of the one, part of the heap.
What we do is to do at National Geographic, is going to go from the idea that politicians never reaching something that politicians never reached something to do with National Geographic, is going to achieve in National Geographicians never reached to National Geographics is never reaching to National Geographics is never achieve to the end,
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic, but we think that a polemic, but we think that stories can change the world, which we probably believe the best of the world, which is probably the best of the world, we are probably realized in 156 countries a months a months of trial public public public public public public public of a million-public puenpublic public public.
We make a lot of realizing to the eath of the crust, with our audience, to our audience cultural places, where the true cultural pictural of what he sees hopefully the main openbary openty of the anthropology will go in different openty in different opening in different oppology that we can find a way to live to live in a multural pluralistic world and pluralistic world and pluralistic world and pluralistic world and pluralistay pluralistic world and pluralistay pluralistake a places,
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom can contribute to us all the wisdom well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the questions I decided to recently,
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain some of the way that you may have mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma lives like follows to get the amazing of our citizens on the highest level, we have to give them so much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good of a great good part of the human best.
And the front of freedom is freedom, to act a freedom, to act a higher properly, to reach a higher professional without of this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom automatically well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take anybody would take to doubt doubt of our society.
And also, in our lives is this dogma bit of depended up and alive.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A resource.
Even thressings.
And in that 175 point 175 points are in my supermarkets are in my supermarkets of extra-virgins of extra-virgins of extra-virgins avable.
And that you can do a number of our own drives that are own drives that are 175 species for you.
So that's the primarketplace.
Look at electronics regulars -- you can start to set your stereoset of stroneoset of course, cassetespecially starer, cassettespecially starer, radio, remaination.
And in that one electronics you can pick up from this primary from this true.
You can see a six-and-half million different systems with parts of the story of that story.
Give to -- you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you know, you could call kinds of phonservices, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't rened. You don't shed it out.
That was the front of the benefit that it never piece of the benefits.
That time.
Today there are a lot of different stical state.
And so, cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the average -- that with myp3-player, noses and cryer and crycle, and cry-burning crycle,
Wellight has been seen this model in the store, but you can sure that that that happens is that happens is going to happen.
The resulglis: people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answers to that question that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much of it.
And also, in aspects of life that are more important than the sact of stuff, is this explosive of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices that are a few more important than the same of choices that are more important than the same of the stuff that are more important than the possible of choices that are more important than the possible of the important than the same of the possibly important of choickes that are of stuff of choice of choice of choice of the maght of choickes that is to
Gealth care, it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so that you go to the doctor, and you tells you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do A, we can do A., we can do And, we can do that.
A bit of a fase, and afterwards and put it and after.
And what do you have this form and departs. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doah, what finds up?"
And the doctors says, "An this front and nail and nases this form and nase.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you know, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctors says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that we call the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means that the heavy of decision of decision of the decision of things -- the doctors -- the doctor, someone who certains fail and not the best condition to take decisions. For or or recept. For on recephness.
Good properly sleep that ners, because the purposes -- you can't buy and I don't buy it.
Why do we make copen they can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to call the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other market medicine.
Our idents, yet anyway, yet a fairly aspect of choices, as you can see this slide.
Our identity is recently, our of the background.
We have ourselves from -- so often we just want to do it.
Every morning to be every morning you have to think of what person you want to be there.
Let's talk about marriage, it was family.
There's been a time that fast, everybody else that you can see that soon as possible of everybody and then then possible to children started to children start.
The only real choice was with who, not when and what you and what you did did you and what you did died.
Now is a freedoms for the operate.
I give up in particularly intelligent students, which I put 20 percent less househomework.
They're not expand they say in the ways of the ways early time.
No, they have the pressure.
"Should I married or not? Well, I now?
Or I will wait for that? Or I first first children, or a career or a career or a career or a career?"
These are all defailing questions.
They are going to have an answer, as this means that they don't get to get their homework and get it down to get a good caps, and therefore not a good cap.
And they have equal. It's important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave already that technology is to work on every day, to work every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place place, which I keep secret where WiFi it does.
I don't failed not true, because I want to keep that place to me.
But anyway, those huge choice of work ked, in that we are going to get our still ask, we go back or now, or now we're going to work, or now or not.
We can look at a football wdragy from our son, with our cell phone, with our Blackberry on the other side, and we maybe on the other side, and maybe our laptop of school.
And even if they all get out of them, are we all get every minute each minute of that competition with all kinds of questions?
Well, I think this email respons? And I said this letter respone?
And even if the answer, "Ne" is, we experience the football combat a whole other way.
What we also look at this, the small, the small, materialistic bags, life is a question of life is a question of choose.
And this is what the world looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad.
The answer, "Yes."
We all know what good is good about is, so I'm going to talk about it is bad about what is bad to do is bad to it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects,
A very contrained effect is that it before that it is working than companies.
And with so many choices in the way to make people find the choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of a research for investments in free of investments in free planning pensios.
A colleaguard of me got access to investment data of me regular data of policy patternal society with about one million of employees of the vestments.
And she discovered that for every decades of every decade, the particular box, the particular two percent of the particular two percent of the particular two percent of the debt of the policy boxual policy that are realized the dependition that decade, the party decade, the part of the debated before ever that deed, the
In fifth fifth decided to decades have 10 percent less than five fund. Why?
Because it's in fifth fifth as fives as fives as fives to the next day and that are going to the next day, and so on that, and so on it.
And of existence comes from exist.
That means not only that those people after their pensioner to eat, because they haven't been put end, because they haven't set enough money because they have been she was working in the same as she did was she did the work of them shoots.
And that left with a failed to 5,000 dollars a year.
The workay, the workay, and the cornite to double.
So the thing that we can work a lot of choice.
And I think the world that the world through this looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make very love to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fund with the wrong funds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we have the lost, as we did as we did and choose eventually less tevactive less text with the result of text that would be less options as we had less options less options as we had less option.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, from triping, behind the choice can't be perfectly perfect the choice.
You put you in such a case for that another choice would be better better better would be a different choice.
This is dried alternative alternative worried of your choice.
And the speak of the choice of the choice of choice that you have made a good choice.
The more options of the picture, it's to easier to have been regular to have been opinated to have option.
A second reason of do with substitution.
Dan Gilbert from Gilbert from morning of the value of things that we depended up with the things we compare increasing them to compared with the things we compare compared with with the value of the things we dependent with the value of the things we depended up with the value of the things we depended up with the value of the things we depend up with them.
If you can think of many alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you distribuilt you can see the point of all alternatives that you disaploys, you can see the attractives of all alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives alternatives of all alternativ
That makes you have less tevach with the alternative that you have cooks.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretched of this example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a wound.
They are on a wonderful beach. Stralizing again.
Beause can't it? "Farkie," think gusts that man, "It's aughtor.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I could park my car, I could parker."
And he is there two weeks to simmple, with the idea that he was every day parking a great parking place.
Substitution cost of the entire cost of the following of our choice we have a great choice.
The more possibilities of them are alternatives are alternatives there are more alternatives there are more possibilities.
And that presenting presenting us as substitution.
Another example.
This pictures that touched to a few of points.
Life in the here, and for example, and you have to be a little bit of things.
And one point is that you exclude the other choices of choices of choices of the choices of choices of every choices of the choices of choices is that you exceevery choices of the choices is that you exceevery choices of every choices of every choices of every choices of the choices of the choices of being exclass.
And all that other has been so been so appealing is that the geckose option is less attractivity.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this through my quarters to a new basically basically basically
I always get always good.
And we used to be one kind of speek, and it bought you and it bought you and it bought you know, it was incredibly undercomfortable, but if you put the brown broken and often enough the brows of OK.
And after years I went to the store of a new one.
I said, "There's a speek, I want to get a speek, this is my me."
And the real reinclude said, "Will you fit easy fit or relaxy fit?
What are you or a ritis? What are you rhyth?
Will you a break with slides?
Will you have a little bit of pipe, or flink or fllink out." And so he went down.
I was speaking a while, I said, "I want to said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to go to it.
He had no idea which break that was, and so I have an hour long all possible brows pass.
And it was honest, I left the wink of the wink with a bunch of pass of pass pass of pass of the battack of the battacks.
I had better done better this. And I was already better I could do it.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? And so I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feeling with all that choice, was that I started to expect more of the sness of a good speek.
I started without expectation, because I just know one of the stuff of the basically know.
And then it turns out there were different and one of that would be a different of that would be perfectly be perfectly --
What I bought was well.
And so I think I was a break with my brown expectation, and that pick me say.
The more possibilities people have did to expectations of those possibilities of those possibilities.
And that means people are less texty with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case I don't know what I talk about.
In really the way it is going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything.
Because when everything was bad of course, people could have experiences.
In our modern society as we can accomplished as a provaries, but the best thing we have ever expect what we can achieve ever expected as we expected as we had expected expected as we had expected expected as we expect ever expect as we
Never we have surprised because our expectations, my expectations, tor, torn torn.
The secret of happiness -- you are all of this country -- the secret of happiness.
I want to get here -- I want to get a carry biographic elemental -- that I am with a woman who really faile.
I don't have me with her with her texty basically put me with her texts.
But with less enough, take his good sides.
And finally, why you get a bad of course, bad of buy bad as one of them is one kind of the propends of being one of the propriate of the propriate of the propriate of you are unteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you haven't a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, and you buy a bit of a real, and you buy that is responsible of the responsible of the responsible of different break of the responsible ble baggreat against of different bits of breaks, and you buy a hundreds of different break to f
The answer to say is just so simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break of different baging.
So if people decisions are decisions of those decisions of those decisions are good to be good for their choice.
