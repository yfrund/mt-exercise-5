And I show these two slight of the polar shows that the last three million years, which was about three million years, about 40 million years, about 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent curator.
But this is the reason of this particular problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a way, the classroom of our global climate system.
It put in the summs and crace in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a accelerated version of what happens in the last 25 years.
The permanenence, the permanentiated in red.
As you can see it from the dark blued.
That's the yearal ice during the winter.
And the summs in the summer summer in summer.
And it called the permanence, or five years, or five years, is almost like blood, that comes from the body here.
In 25 years of this go.
And that's a problem because the frozen floating around the Northern Iszea very big global warms and there's a very big amount of carbon frozen carbon diase, when it comes from death microbes in methane.
To leaving the total amount of the total amount of atmosphere, it would double the amount of the atmosphere.
In some understanding in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey winter of the University of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another understand more.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver of this is a smell aterriver
The water volume is bigger than ever bigger than ever ever bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerly, right in South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea leave style because it is the landics in the sea of where it comes in the sea legal community.
These streams are flightly flightly to the sks.
On the other side of the planet, on the South poll, the largest ice massive of the planet,
And last months scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative icro-balance balance balance balance of scientists that the whole continent is reported to the cure continent now is reported a negative ical balance balance balance.
More specific is the ice of the South pole is very quickly very quickly to the south of waters eiland capture of the souland faster ish eilands.

In the Himalaya, the two after greatest ice mass, there are now new now, there are new now, who were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting his drinking water from the meless of the mely.
In the Andes, this glassing the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now streams.
But when they disappeared, it also dressing it too.
In California was a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you read reading the predictions of it.
This global dream has led to a dramatical sty-fires of forest fires.
And the number of natural around the world is standing with an incredible and never seen.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intended to be completely infully intended to be completely intention.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happens.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 available to do 14.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from the west-view of Indiase subcontinent, there is a dragh sun-dressing dragh drify in the oceans.
The only caused to warming the Earth, is designs of the Earth, which is burns of 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and voice is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest out-largest emergency with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more of more urbing countable.
But we see a course.
These are the barrassed country that the building was the building in the last years, and where green alternatives were presented to the last years.
There's a political battle on the country.
The steone carbon and oil industial gave for 250 million dollars to promotly clean-carbon dollars to promotly clear.
And that image me thinking.
Rond the charst of the home of Tennessee, about four billion liters of billion liters of money model moder.
You probably have seen the news.
This is the one-greatest display in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hold about how that works.
So here I am here. For the LHC is the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever experiment ever underneath in the case of the course.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion a billion of a billion times a billion times a second of second.
Enorm ambitious, thus!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is where I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in diameter -- 44 meter in diame.
Spectacular photo from ATLAS. in continue so you can see the scale.
And in 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that care of a party current in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that is all the LHC to the LHC and with a piece of the LHC with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the LHC, which is current in the detector of the LHC in the detector.
In other words, when we knew that picture picture that picture that the machine works, which is a huge overwinning is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest of the most right or this, or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden wear.
And those days, 13 thousand thousand amper resources when the engine on full power to work in full force of the machine on the full of those who worked in full of the machine on the full of the machine on the full reason for the full of the reason ago.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small wear."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superceive on whole temperaturs.
So at multiply 271 degreed, the space between the stars, who can draw drags that drags that dragm down.
In one of the connection between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructivator.
And so the wire was something warmer, and there was a electric weather against 13 thousand ample of the 13 thousand amper resources.
This was the result.
This is even more than 20 centimeters when you realize that magnets more than 20 tons of away 20 tons of the ton again.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We have them all tool.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC is intact.
We'll be again, and we expect measurements in Juni, so that we can go further with the expensive of what the building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have accidents that debate the debate of science started research. It's easy to research of science research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be so much the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did during the decise of the valuable experiments of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of human mind than representation was Michael Fara's mind to the definite of human minds of the human minds of science that our imagins are not a define in nature, that our re-define designs of the designing the designs of the designing our made of the design define in natures of the definitires of the definite of the define of the define of the res of the define define definitive experident of the experire, and of the definitive experive experirea
Thank you.
I would like to start with you to ask to your childhood to your childhood when you play with blocks toys.
When you discovered how to figure out to understand and remote awareness and remote on the learning of space and learning space and deal relationships.
Rum insight is a strong because of the world to understand the world to us.
If a information that inspired by the nurture of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advision with my advision -- I started to ask Jee of Kalanithi -- I started to ask -- what if we could use a computer from that one mouse to a set of which is information as a kind of digital fingers that information moil reauthorital fingers we can put up with both a plat the pyclassing of information that we could pursuing a pires of information that information in formation in formation that information that information that information that information that we can fital fit to fitation with boiable to figation in a figation in a figation of information of information of information of the pact of inform
and orders can we want to be able to me?
This question of this question that we decided to look for a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort conversation is a Sift a interactive computer size of a cookies.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel each other, their movement and they detect a screen and they detect a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade, like block of course, they can be moved by understanding to understand in the floor through to understand the nuclear under,
Bovendis are Siftable, a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
And so that these tools have a more physical different of their movement and of their movement and of the way we have to discovered them from each other, and even of the way we have a different new and fun.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is institude, to show a video is to show up a video to play county others played and others played played played --
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And then Indicated together, they will be interests.
If they are currened, they can also do it and can be able to smile.
And they feel that they feel and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of the interesting consequences of the interaction, as it was a fluid of the interact of a color if it was a fluid -- it was a fluid of a color if it was a fluid of the interaction, as it was a fluid of the interaction, which was a fluid of the interact that we realized to realize that one of
In this example three Siftable, and I can use them to go out color in a fairly in a lot of course, where they are getting together.
If we have drive to save some of the back.
There are some clear clear capable to play clear to play clears with languages and logics that we want to give people to give things the ability to try to try to see things quickly, and the result of the result of them to see things figure out of the education.
Here's the developing of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic of a Fibonacci --
Here's a game between a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter to every Siftable, and drived the dictionary words are controlled in a dictional dictionary in a dictionary dictionary in a dictional book.
And after about 30 seconds it is a new series of being a new series of letters with bases of series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm closed it out of it and I close to make it try to make it and make a video of it.
They were really road away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have almost no instructions of the applications.
Everything you have to say "Mak words" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people on test.
That's our youngest benefit of the front of the right?
And it seems that he was just the Siftable.
For him him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting show.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can burn new characters in the scene, by the Sift of the table, with the Sift of the table.
Here's the sun.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good does do! Yeah!
By the shahaving Siftables and the next to place each other he can reach the characters with each other -- Video: Wlllet et away!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hall!
DM: It's a story with a story with an open end.
and he decision how it it it disses how it break and he decision.
Video: The cat flies again.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have evolved to be recent a sound product that every Siftable, like the lead, bass and drum.
Anybody has a four different variations, where you can choose what you want to do is using it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftable, so you can be injected the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the atterns of a lightly Sift of a live controllaborial of available like reverb and filter.
They're addition to a sound and addressing by cancelebrating to the sound and countable.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: That M: We're starting with a leaving in two Siftables, to a first pattern, leave by a slight of through a lead.
Now, I place the base line here.
Video: DM: Now I feel some bagwork.
Video: And I courage the filter to the drums, so I can influence it to the effect live it effect live in the effect of live in the drums, so I can influence the effect of the drums, so I can influence the effect of the drums, so I can influence the filter of the drums, so I
Video: DM: I can accelerated the cancers of the tempo block of the tempo block of the block of the block of the block of the block of the cancertain of the cancertain the cancers of the buck.
Video: DM: Now I capture the filter of the expression.
Video: DM: I can re-class while it plays.
I don't have to plann, so forever to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And the end of the whole through the volume of the volume to show to cancells left to the left solid to the left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people, my passion of new people, which are stemed to the way our brain and work our brain and work our brains and work our bodies and work and lighing.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the same to a very new generation to resource a very new generation of interact with digital media that information to our world like we want.
I thank you very much.
I look at it to go out with you all and talk to you to all of you.
I'm writing out.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am not writing for a long time that change will be change in the way that will change it.
And yet there is unless something property happened in my life and career, and career, and career, I had to see my relationship with my work with my work again.
And it started with a book I wrote understanding understanding of the world -- "Eten, Biddy, Biddy, very contrained to my early work the world and a international piece of the world and a international primarily was writor.
The consequence is people all over the whole thing that I have to do is called me anywhere.
What is what -- is doing --
People come to me to me, and ask to me and ask "Don't you any this success is never going to be success of this success?
If you don't know that you will read your entire life writing but never remaining a book publishing where people will be heating heam for warm to heave warm that people will walk up to heave warm and write you're not going to write your entire life is going to write your entire life writing to the whole life w
If you can't get there?"
Eright-hitted soid.
Of course, that would be a very much that I remember 20 years ago, I was crue 20 years ago, when I was write to write that I wanted to be write that I wanted to be write 20 years ago.
People said, "Don't you get that you never successful?
If you don't get a afraid for deal, you know, you will supply it by the way,
If you don't know that you live to this work in this work without of this is not coming out of your broken dream on the puin your broken dream of broken dream of broken dream of broken dream of broken dream of brok?"
And it is that inside.
And in the short comes to the questions of this questions that "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things that are called things that are called
Always the ways of it.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you know that all of a lot of other things.
For instance, and other single things.
But what is writing is writing myself where that fear from, where that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody is capture to be afraid to the work for the work for the work of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the work of work for the work of work that somebody is capture to their opin?
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of them on the mind of the minds, something that happens doesn't happen to work at all.
Take my father. He was a single engineer, and I can't remember that there he did worked in 40 years.
And so you say, "John, how is it with chemistry block?"
No, it was not working about it.
And to be fair fair through the centuries have to have the centuries, not the reputation of the eter-depressive alcoholists.
And then that have this kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have happened to be the reputation mental instable.
Look at the griming doty doing the most magnificant creative mind the most magnificant creative minists of the 20th century.
Many of fiels is fairly fail.
And even those of those who don't have suicide of suicide of the suicide of their gave buricate.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty what to say about your life work.
But of these kinds of view we don't look at any more.
We all heard it before and we have heard it all a single accepted.
The heart thought is that creativity is creativity to connection is connected to suffering artist-eventually intended to ell.
So I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea lives?
You see that, you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I don't think it all the way the way at all.
I think the realization.
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see this century this century is that this this century.
We can do creative sports.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to dark in the dark of dark life.
And seen the phases that my career now in my career now is now in.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper fixed years.
I can may be working on four decades.
Hominstanything I'll have to do anything I is going to be now by the outside world when it work that followed to that extraordinary successful.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can felt you know, higher my greatest success of my greatest success of my greatest success of me.
Jemity, what a idea!
If you think about that, you're going to be nine to the nein the morning to the nine hours in the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love to the work I love with the work I love to the work I love to the work where I love with the work where I love with the work I love to the work I love with the work I love to the work where I love to love me love to love me love to love me of the work where I love to love me love me the work I love to love me love
The question is: "Do me?"
And after a long after a long time I can do that I can only go by writing if I can deal with a psychological protection in the process of inside the process built of the process.
I have to create a safe distance safe airly between myself and my overage of the way between myself and my overage for the reactions of my future publications.
I have looked at the last year, I went to ways that do that.
I have in the history and I have done in other history in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to see creative people to get creative people to get creative people to get creative people to deal with the emotional complicative process.
My quarter, I was broad to me with me of the old Greeks and Roman and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Roman and Roman believed that creativity comes from hundred of themself.
Men believed that creativity was a good mind of a dive, who was from a very, unknowledge place to humans to humans to humans to the humans of unknowledge.
The Greeks call these breads of creativity called "demonen."
And so, Socrates believed he had a demon who had a demon who influence him in the words.
The Romeins had a kind of a kind of idea.
And in the called them was a bit of a geniused to creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Roman is not a genius, is not a particularly pended up the person clear.
In their political entities was a kind of magical entities that are up in the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the huiself.
If the artists artists was the genius, reading the genius.
He gave he shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the psychological protection to the result of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is going to be work in his work.
The artists of artists to be protection to the against for example,
If you were working billiant to be there, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Everybody knew that is an invisible genius,
You know, you know, you get a work of work -- it's not just about you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty indeed.
Long time is that reason is how in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change the Renage --
There fold is a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysterious of human beings and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures from the device of the device world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity, that creativity is completely from the individual individual
And for the first time in history was about artists artists that they were not that geniused to be a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I think I think that a big fair.
And to one person is to single individual individual human beings believe he or she or she or she or she or she or she famili, of everything good, creative and the familiar psyche.
Anybody anybody to sun, the sun,
Egos are bloning up to huge proportions and there are unimagine expectations of prestations to exprestitution.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years, a lot of artists has made a lot of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists that dream in the last 500 years.
If that's so what I think, and I think, "What is now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back understanding the relationship between humans and creative mysterion?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes.
Probably there are in the audience people who have read scientific double double double creatures of artists of artists of artists to inspirating artists to inspirating the work of artists of artists of artists that are in the audiences of the idea that are purpose to inspiration.
It doesn't seem to me.
I went to question I went to me.
Why not?
Why would we have this thought to be able to follow that thought of this?
And it is just so much as much as all the other explanations of the total countability that decided that decided to the creative processing including the creative process.
And everybody who has try to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, the creative process here -- knows that the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative processing of the inside of the path of the anyone who has been here -- knows that the creative process -- -- knows that it has not always to create the creati
That sometimes it feels that almost paranorally.
I have the great American closer of the great American Ruth Stone meet.
She's disk in the nine. Her whole life all life in the close of this.
She told me about her right on the platounand of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field of work, she felt a poem coming a poem on the country.
It was, so said she said, as if there was a big wave air came to ream
And so a poem wave than the country to her the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, and she felt that the shasking her and knew that her on that moment but one thing to do is standing one thing to do is standing for her life.
And she was running home by the poem and she had to see it as quickly possible and paper.
When the poem through her was her only through her only to write it on the same to write it on a crowd to write it on the crowd of her came up with her one.
Sometimes it was not enough.
Then running and running and running it doesn't reach.
And in the moments of moments up the close of her -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another dich.
And also there were a bit of the story -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they died.
And then she was in looking for paper and paper and paper it poem through her its.
Juist on that moment she had a pencil to pick up a pencil of the possible in that moment she had a pencil of the moment she had a penciled.
And with her other hand, so told me she was poem the poem from the air.
And she picked up the poem in his body back in her body, and back it back up in her body, as she wrote it back to the cite.
In that cases the close of course, but then in a piece of paper -- but then in the case of paper --
When I heard that, I thought -- what happens to happen to be able to do it my creative process of creative process of the creative process of it.
And so my creative process of this creative process not! I'm not medium!
I'm a mile, who are every day on the same time, and sweating the same time, and sweating it with blood, sweeks and trans down through it is a good showing and flowing it in the same time.
But even in that day I had a swer every day I had such an experience.
You can also know it myself, that feel that feel that creative ideas in your broive ideas in your broidentify from a source you can identify identifics.
What is that resource?
How can we use it without the without we can be cut?
And one way that good for us is a good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I do is musicians is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazin.
We had the way to do it in this.
Tom is a big part of his life has been part of his life of the amazing of the amazing artists that take all the power to get to the universes of the universes of creative impulse creative impulse of creative impulse to him.
With the 1990s Tom some rough.
And one day he remember in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed it radical.
And as he was so true so he was so heard a fragmental melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that is doing that it does, understand is inflying --
It was a beautiful goods, and he wanted to be the hold of the hold.
But it didn't do that.
He had no paper -- not a tape of paper at the same way.
The amazing exciting exciting exciting to him: "I recommend the melody recommendity, and then it stay me the century of the familiar and then it requence.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the walling?"
"Think you very much a song you can write a song of you can write a song of you can write a song you can see a song you can see a song you that I can do a song of a bit of a bit of you can do a song you
If you really want to get that this song -- you have to reach again, if I have time for you.
And it doesn't have anyone else did someone else.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohend." And from that moment in the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar universe.
But the slight of exciting the creative process in him critical currency of the genius.
The genius, it was close to close and live it alone.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner really, it was not quite at all.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a lot of course, I had a crop.
I was in the middle of Etten, Biddle in the middle of Ettom.
And I think of course, I mean, I mean,
You know that well, you want to work and you can't do good and you think it is a terrible disaster disaster. It is just a horrible book of it.

I wanted to read the whole project all the project of this.
And then I remembered Tom who was to be certain to be genius, and I decided to be a point to way.
I wish me from my manuscrips and I focused to me to a camer.
And I said, "Lister this, "Listen thing, we know everybody is not just book, then coming through me.
You can see I see everything I have in what I have.
More I can't give it.
If you find that it must be better can, you know, you've got to do it.
Do you do that? Do you can't do that, right?
I just write to write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular is that invite away that it is a different on cantable,
Tja--- United it comes here on the down.
Eures ago, there was in the North African desert people to dance in the North African desert music.
Urine, and hours and hours and hours to the morning burns.
That was great, because the dancers were full to the dancers were full --
But sometimes a very slide, it happened to be a good thing.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you also have some of you have also seen in a performer.
It was as if the time standing and the dance of the time and the dance of the pate.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights, but now everything together.
And it seemed to seeing a human beings only a human beings.
In him, under him, under him glass --
A fully fired hold him.
If you did something that happened to happen to Dan people what it was Dan they started to clap and curring in childh, "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historically fact, in fact, when the Moren Span, they broke this well.
The deck is real realize through the centuries, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, old in "Ol, oly."
That hear you today the day in died, and flamengodances.
If a piece of artists or magically, or magically does, "Allah, old "Allah, old age, Allah, brarab."
And, understand souldn't see a glimpse of God.
Prified what we need.
Lastig is that the dance of the next morning the next morning that he discovered that he discovered on dinary 11 hours at the morning of the morning of the morning.
And at that moment he is that a little bit of an older man with depenever set in the moment will never come to zull up to zull room will come to such the moment is coming up to zull that moment is that we have a bit of the same high-high-high-high-hig
Maybe never going to be anybody God anybody during his dance.
What to do is he now to live now life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show to show to creative spirit to creative spirity.
But so painful highly needle.
Imagine you don't get out of the excited that the most unusual aspects of your person coming from yourself.
Imagine you believe you that you have a while in a while, of a while,
When you get it ready with it.
And so it protect is everything.
I hand-infers that thought to do thought of thought to it.
The last months I have worked on a book that inside that inside will alone. The book where many reach is looking at is outside to be expensive to the book.
The follower of that illuster progression of the illuster progression of the illuster of the illuster progress.
If my minminds me with me to go to me and hold me the same fore: Don't banger ance.
Don't do your work.
Blive just doing you do this, whatever it is.
If you get your task is to dance, dance.
If the good genius, that you can decide decision in your work at enious moment of the amazing source by lying to ful, "Ole !"
Because it doesn't happen thance anyway.
And also then, "Ol!
I believe that harted.
"Ol!" what, because we pure out of pure human love and owness of the human love and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have a few of these projects, and what it can mean and what it can mean, and what it can mean, and what it can mean, and what it can meaning, and the discovered of new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were trying to do it: we were the biology to digitize digital code, and now we try to go from that digital code to go to a new phase, with the designs and synthetic designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And what I think is something that I think a lot of biologists to understand in different level.
We have different approached different approach, the back to minimum components.
We're now going to be a 20 years.
When we have sequenced, it was a sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask -- we can live regenerate, or can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universum?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genitalium, with the kind of a kind of that can be multiply in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a small oratory in a laboratory cure of a small organism,
And we have tried to look at a non-genome can come up to a none.
We can do in the order of hundred generating from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relatively simple to the metabolical card,
Gelebrity, this is simply simply --
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a live.
We decided that the only representations of this chromosphere, to synthetic so we could have the components to synthetic so we could consider the components to ask the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions to ask this chromosome of the most fundamental questions that we could ask this chromosome
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we have a chromosphere, "Can we have a chromosphere?"
And the chemistry the chemistry of this very big molecules that we never see.
And, if we can do that, can be a chromosphere?
A chromosphere, by the way, but a piece of chemical iners.
So, our tempo of the digitial life is accelerating life is accelerating on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code, but is a slow slowly, but is taken to be able to reach the genetic code.
And our last point would be it in this moment would place this exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of the city, to start with a bio-ethic typical typical currents.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world who makes DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more mistakes of it.
So we had to do a new method of these small pieces and corrating these small pieces and corrating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt of the genome Phi Phi X-174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the bage, the bage,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stop, in the bacteria piece of chemical stop, and viral particles, and viral particles.
The viral particles were cells, when we came out of the cells, they were coming back after that, and death the E. coli.
I was a long time in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that they were model but all of good fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which the software the software own hard-within biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in size of viruses, so we could fired the cassettes of various --
to go to understand what the realize the realize components of a living cell
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that it has to be very accurave.
When we first put it together this genome together in 1995 was the standard of the default of a 10,000 baseparating of the pares.
And then we found after 30 mistakes after 30 folits. If we had the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start to start on the state of it.
And the design of the design is the design of the design is that 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so they can go to build a 50 letters that we have to design so they can go together.
We design here unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read watermers that we have in the stop.
And this: We have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, Gend, God, God and T.
Trios of those letters of codes for back 20 aminozers -- that there is a long-ter-ozure.
So we can use the genetic code of the genetic code, thought.
And then we just called "Is we just called "Is a mal.
Some of them were calling country that there were no close to it.
We have these pieces so designed them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repay and put in each other.
And we started to make pieces of course, to start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters of 24,000 letters, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, take sets from 2,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stadium we crowd a continue of these pieces so we could sequence them because we want to create a process because we want to create a process that is very robuled -- that's going to show them.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate baseparate -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
And that represents the exert of all the modern tools of modern molecular biology.
So we went to raise the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologism that "homologist repaints, that is used by the biology to repaDNA can foot together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million raid raid to can.
And you see that in the top panel, so, the chromosphere, just the chromosphere.
12 otated 24 hours later, he was in the weather of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms that are thousands of organisms that can do thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms of
These organisms can completely remoted.
They can live in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that life can find it in space that can find any example, a new aquaticically environment.
NASA has married to show that there is a lot of it, there.
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did them in it.
Gist worried automatically conversation.
This is not an electronen-microscope picroscope picroscope picroscope picroscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we expand we expand it out.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule molecule by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule-wiched million of today
If we would present the drugs with a 10-points letter, without spations of the pages only to present the genetic code.
Good, how do we start a chromosp? How do we call it right?
With a virus is clearly easy easy.
With a bacteria is it much more complicator.
It's also simpler if you are doing under eukaryots, like we just take the cell and does another in, and it doing a different in, and that's what you know if it cell clone.
And the bacteria species of the chromosphere, but we have a full integrated that we have a full transplant to a full transplant to a chromosome of a cell transplant to a different, and it can activate.
We have a chromosphere, we have a chromosphere.
These are about so far as far from each other as people and mously as people and mously mously as people and mic.
We add some extra little bit of extra general so we could have a chromosphere.
We have reference to enzyms to make all the protein all of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protected with enzyms of the protection.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very available graphic images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought that he would come to be just coming to develop the process of what we do is to develop the process.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of the third chromosome of the third of thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who imagine, as if there is one of the only change at the same time, not a lot of biology communated to be a lot of biology community.
There are enzyms that restriction enzyms who are realized DNA real restriction.
The chromosphere, that in the cell that was not ever ever eat.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stop it -- well,
It was expression of the other chromosome of chromosphere, and it was strange material, it was every time in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new chromosome cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cromosome of chromosome of the courtype of the courtor, and it was the other chromosphere, and we had the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of
He was the blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the one species and changed in the new species, and it changed on the new species, and he had stopped in the cell of the new software that we stop.
All the proteins changed the membrans -- when we read the genetic code, it was exactly in which it was changed.
This is a masound as a genomical chemist, but we're in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Good, I have a pathy better that this is not a creation -- this is a billion years of evolution, in 3.5 billion years, and I have a new version years evolution, and I have a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical new species where there in this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to get inside of six--half to 9-billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years.
We have a lot of food, with food, with clean, burning clean, fuel for the six-billion.
That's getting difficult to do that.
We use five billion ton cold, more than 30 billion cutter.
That's 100 milos fix falls a day.
When we take biological processes in ogenschool or any thing that we do about it, it is a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all the carbon dioxide of the batmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronical tronical industry had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the electronics.
We are conversary limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now dank you very quickly synthesize synthesize called combination genomics."
We have the ability to build a big robot that can build a million chromosomes a day.
If you put up to the 20 million different genes, or trying to optimize octan, or trying to optimize octan, or medicine, new vaccine, new vaccine, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard standard of the selection.
We can select select for life vatable, chemical or fuel production, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design real of what real design is that we work on the corner and a new species on the computer can design a new species on the computer.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We focus on the fourth generation of fuel generations.
And the way you have seen you in the floor of the floor of experiment.
We have second and third generation of the fuel of the burning fuel of coming in from sugar, as sugar, as a sugar, like octan or different species like octan or different species like octanol.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have big influence without the food price and the available of available and the available of course, and therefore we have the cells that we have the first food generation of the way that we do it in the first food, and we think we have the first fool of the first generation of fun generation in about 18 months of the first generation of fixes of the 18 months of the foods.
Sonlight and CO2 is a method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the depth, about 2.5 miles early cooking at the cookkend-cool solid set of cools.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources.
We are looking at the way if we can take CO2 -- which is easy via pips of pips in fabried to fabried out of fuel to fabricated to fuel this processing to fuel this process.
So in a short time basically we think we are thinking that we are in too breads on the basic question: "What is life?"
We have a realization, you know, the cities, the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, what?
A important energy source is being a major source.
But we also now work on the use of these tools to think of these tools to think of these packs.
This year, the flu, we walking it behind the facts of the facts of the particular vaccine.
I think that can change that can change from a teforward vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see how the future that the evolution is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eukaryota.
We are far to improved from the improved of people.
Our goal is to sure that we make a chance long enough to survive long enough to survive that may be doing that may be doing to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to a Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a vironment in which you local or in the distance of visual data can work data can work data can work data can work data can work or in the distance of visual data can work or on the distance of visual data can work with immense environments of visual during in which you can work in the envir
We look at this here many gigabyts, and can seeing it in digital images and can see, and out, navigate and extract it to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information, how big these collections or images are images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapial completely of the Library of Congress,
It doesn't matter all because the only thing that would be influence the prestations of the prestations on a screen system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, a example of non-ipture data.
This is the graute of Dic. Each collection is a chapter.
To prove that it really does it really does -- and no imagination, we can do something like this, to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read a book.
I wouldn't have it reason it -- I wouldn't crafy it.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Each big picture is the beginning of a sub-battle.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or capitual magazine or newspaper, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also have something done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a net of advertised from high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising extra information -- and we have extra information information information of information -- and we have extra lot of a higher resolution -- and we have extra normade of a normal resolution -- and we have extracted
If you want to see the possibilities of these cars, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make the limits that we can do the limitations of accutting the screen of accounts.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course, country to be a country to put a technology like this, I will not spending time -- except in this field that we can also much of this field -- except that we can contribute this field of course.
These are all the weighting in the U.S.
And then the population of the NASA --
So let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosyn, who connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snahington, provenessary by Steve Seitz University of Washington, defails by Seitz on U.W.
and Rick Sseliski in Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have broken these images to coming up with the real room -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashors or panorama and all these things are spaces.
I don't know sure or there's time in a certainly time to show or another environments.
There are much space that are more space.
I want to like to do one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth -- to the communicate that we work in my head is the real power of these technique of the environments on our website.
We had to love to the advocate and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dadiction of the Notre Dadicurrent in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the cam
And each of these orange layers gives a picture that are part of this model of this model.
And so this are all Flickr images, which are in these way space basically crop up in this room of the copped of these areas of the copped in this room of Flickr pieces, in this way.
And we can capture on simple designs.
I had never thought I had thought I would ever work to Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is so much of this is so much of the way that it is so much of the way to be so much of the way that is so much to be so much to be so much of it is so much to be so capture of this is so much about this.
I believe you can see that these many types are cameras are cameras are cameras to mirror flexcameras, a big number of them,
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much discovered by fact, and so so so so so so much
And anywhere between this is a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dadicately is also good by the program.
If we did the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say is that we can really things with the social environment. This is the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of them, the Earth -- and buy that everything about everything -- and buy that everything about everything that about each other.
All these pictures are represented to each other, and form together, the same than the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth is the whole Earth
And so, this as a confist on Stephen Lawler's work on the Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when it uses to the benefits for the people who use it.
Their pictures are being metaphor-data that somebody else data that somebody else
If someone would like these sacres and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Dadicates with all of those data, and I can use it as a access to that space, and that can use it as a access to that space, which metaphold of anyone of these kinds of cruphotographs, and creating a kind of crue modal, and creating social experience.
And of course, it's the meadoing a bit of this immense virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who didn't only from air pictual images and applications and other applicative memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes you software possible to a day, in the next years, all images that are part by everyone in the world can be cope together to the world together?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovery.
And it creates to your wishyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the images.
And that's designing when you think about the riching when you think about the richdom of semantic information that mantificial information of these images.
When you look for the web page in the web page of the piece of the piece of the piece of the imagina of information about what the image of information about what the image.
What if now that is the image of your image is to all your imagination?
Then the number of the number of the universial connections and the amount of wealth that comes to give it comes to gigantic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of revels and from eating eating the ability to live them to live the old oontes that are not forget to life their past forget to the wind, the resources in the wind, the profitterest in the wind, the profitter, the profound in bitters of bitters.
The science that Jaguar's still reviews still the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inven-parents, or that the myths of Inven-parents or that in the Himalaya booddhist of Dharma, remember is really dhood of the Dharma, you remembers is not a breath, the world in which we live in a absolute sings of the world in a absolute sings of the world is not a model of the model of the worworworking of the working of the world, but the work of the work of the working of the work of the working of the work of the work of the way of the work of the work of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
the consequence of a course, the confist choices that makes our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all sharing the same adaptation: Wordincers in the world.
We all make it independed up in the case rites.
And I go with the individed of the individe.
So it can't be surprise that we sings, dance and art art and art art art.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the song and the ritme of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to the Penan in the Borneo, or the Vood-Andeaths in Haiti, or the fighting in the Kaisut-batching in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-burn bing or the Caravant of the Carea -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- this is the man with whole through the destroke, or now a month aheaded of the wholangma colanga -ma,
Everest, the Godin-mother of the world.
They all learning us all different, different, our different, our different, our differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope on it.
Sums the intelligencultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet, and it is as important life web : the biosphere.
This cultural life web you imagine you imagine you imagine the eat.
The eath of the course of all the way you can defining all the time, dreams, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas inspirations that are continates that are continue by human imagination and intuitions that are inspirations of our imagination.
The eath is the big nalatence of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we can be able and we can already be amazing newser satisfied of animal.
like the biosphere is a slide, is the eath is the eath that is called -- and in much larger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist that least half of all the species on the point of extinction because that's simply not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario coming doesn't even in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is loss of this is losing in the language.
And then everybody here was born born born of the Earth case --
A language is more than her words, or her grammmatic rules.
A language is a cutting of human soul.
It's the burning of value that the soul of every unique culture the material world reach.
Each language is a century mind of a disine, a disinction of a disinction of spiritual possibilities.
And from common to six, thousand language today the day of that, not fluistrated in children's fluistated in childrent.
They're not taught babies around babies of babies
Effective means that, unless a change that they are dead.
Is there something that is too lonely to be able by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the children's ancestors of the children's children's reward?
And pick that one is somebody's benefits on every two weeks on earth of the Earth, because every two weeks die. And every two weeks of him the last letter-field language.
Some of you say, "Super, the world are not the world as we all have the same language if we all all the same language. I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba names.
Or Kogi." you realize your ogi.'
So what I want to do is take you today is taking you on a short journey by the eating of what is lose has to be lost a picture of what is lost in fact,
Many of us forget that when I talk about a different way of being a different way of being a different way."
Take for example, this Barasana child in the Northern Amazone, the full of the anaconda, which is that they believe that the melk of the anaconda, in the brain, in the buy of sness, in the buy of sness.
This is a full that cognitive the colors and not understanding the skling of the skults, because it of the sky, where the ful, where the ful, where the full depending on the oers of the oerwer is depending on the equipment of the skulty that is depending on the skulls of the skulls of the skulty that is dep
They have a falling language of course, which is the linguist exogogy is called someone who is called somebody who is called someone who speak a different language.
This has his roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary full in their homes, or seven talks or seven talks to about seven talk, but you never heard someone heard in the mythological hear.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinating tribes that I have lived with which I had lived the Waorani in North Ecuador, a fairly in 1958 fe-declined contact came to the contact of the passociated with the fascinator.
In 1957 tried to five missionarians contact to explain the critical fault.
And they remembered pictures they from themselves from themselves to our idea's idea that pular that this is never seen a two-dimensional.
They took the pictures and tried to find the form behind the face of the face of the face of the face of the pictures and tried to find the pictures and tried to figure out the pictures and tried the pictures and tried to the face the pictures and triew the pictures and tried to get the face the face of the face of the face.
When they didn't found the device they found that the divel of this, they were responding to the fsionarians with spears with spearned by the missionary of the frame.
But the Waorani doesn't just outside the outside of the break of the other.
440 percent of their mortalities came out of their mortalits.
We could have generations to eight generations back to eight generations from a natural of a natural death of a natural death of a natural of course.
When we took a bit of the early showed that one man ever diever diever died, and then he was just a curated to be a amazing ships of the eye of the same capital of the same ouldn't knowledge of the ancient knowledge.
Their hunters could be cruels could be clean-adapty and tell animal of animal species it was.
Begin 1980s, I got a contributes to reference, when my professor me to inflashion to Haiti to infill gene-gene-gene-gene-society that are the basis of president Duvaler of presidential elity, as a also the way that are presidential elitorps and it made out of the summber vironments.
And to this sensational things that can understand what to understand something about this particularly belief of Vodoun from Vodoun -- that no cular is that not culate a cular magic.
It's a complex metaphysical world-image means -- very interesting.
Would I ask you the big world-religions, what would you say you?
Christian, islam, booddhism, boodhism,
One continent is always outside of the attack that Africa was not religious to the Sahara religious belief. Natural had been to believe this.
Voodoo is simply simply the destillar of this deploy-up ideas, in the tragical diaspora at the tragical diaspora at the slavery period.
What foodoo is so interesting is the living and death.
The living bars barrain.
The minds can be touching of the Great Water, answers to the dance of the dance of living time the soulle of life is moving the soul, so that during one that one is the full of the follow is the following moment the fold is the depended the follow is the depended the soul.
And so why is food-air, "You're going to go to the church and talk about God.
We do in the temple and God." And because you are so God." And because you're so invited by the mind, what can you happen to happen to happen in the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a blue show you reason that show you in trance that funishing burrence of trance collision gling collapse.
This is a true demonstrates the ability of the mind to influence the mind to influence the minds of the mind is extreme is extreme is in extreme is in extreme is that we have extinfluence is to influence the mine of the mind to influence the mine of the mind to influence the mind of the mind to influence the mine of the mine of the mind to influence the spirit is.
And of all the volves I have ever lived with the Kogi, the most extraordinary, a ful, a whole of Colombia.
Afrstamels of the Tairona society, which is ever the Caribic coast-flat Colombia have of Colombia in the nasles of the individual conversation.
They are pulled in an isolated vulsion of the obvious offically mass the coast.
In a blood blow continent continent was never ful, this is never ful, by the Spanks.
And then they get a ritual priest, but the training society, but the training to priest of the priest to priest of the particular.
The young acologists are away to their families when they are three or four are.
They are coming up in a world of darness, in the world of glaciers, in the case of glaciers, 18 years.
Two periodes of nine year, conscious to break the nine months of nine months of them in the school of their mother cutter.
Now they're talking to the speak of the big mother.
These time are the society of them the society values that are realize that only the reason that only hits the cosmic or ecological emagine or ecological equal ance in stand
This indedicates with the day that they are inside to the outside and for the first time in their life, if they are 18 sunseen they're seeing in their lightly moment of the first light, if the Sun landscape of the first lights, and the Sun capitters of the light in the full shows they have all abstract in follow the full say: The talk in follow is to full sodd soile: The learning she say is that they are in follow gencately s:
"Did you know? It's like I said you've got to say you.
And so beautiful is the reality to you." They call himself the earders.
And we are the younger brothers, the responsible for the destruction of the world.
And in this point is the intuition is very important.
If we think of thinking about indicate and landscape, we often fix Rousu seau and the old fabelt of the epartic, a idea that racistic in his simply is in his simplicity.
Or we get to the Thoreau and say these people's closer to the Earth than we disince.
Indiculations are nor sentimental falls by nostalgy.
For both is a little space in the malaria moerass of the Asmate or in the icro-winds of Tibet. Designing in Tibet. Designing out of time and ritual mystical mystical mystical mystical of the Earth is basically basically based on a lot of subtled subtile that the Earth its that the idea is basic basically sure.
What does it means that a small child from the Andes, which is grown with the mountain Apu-minished is that or her locks, or her locks, a fundamental different human beings and a different relationship of Montana, which will have a small child from Montana, with the idea that the mountain a cape of Montana, ready to mine called the mine of mine.
Or it the lives of a mine or a lot of erother, is irrelevant.
And interesting is the metaphor that the reason that defines the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were ccapital to get cape.
And so that made me a different than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forests the lives of the lives of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel and the Kromme Snavel of the world.
These mind of their minds are important in their Hamatsaines
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary of their extraordinary extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture I jump. I mean, in the Northern Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive of the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayayage is not only the pasinating is not just the parmacological potential of it, but how it is. It's built of two sources.
Enerzy is a woods, light carboline, harmaline and harmaline in the hallucinating and light hallucinering and light hallucinering in the halluciners.
If you take the plant -- it seems that a blue sky, it seems by your floating through your floating drives through your floating --
The plant is mixs of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee fridis.
The plant tracks powerful trial tryptamines, naudience to brain dicurnite serotonine, 5-methoxyltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.
Did you ever see the Yanomami as they seen that doing that substance of different species that are also that substance of different species that are methoxyltryltryltryptamine of vied methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylabors to the Yanomami methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryl, and the substance of different species that are doing nut?
That pool you nose in blower nose is when you get a shot of a barokay, to country to country to country to country to country of electricity. This is ships of the reality; the ship of the reality.
I tried to do my professor, Richard Efrom Shultes, to convince the psyched-discovered the psychediscovered by his discovered by his 1930s.
I painted that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when it effect his hallured -- there is no one more hallucination. Tryptamines are not oralines oral. Tryptamines are not oral.
They can only be oral oral to be environmental that the monoamine of you effect in the sample of the samine of the samine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of you that the monoamine of the samine of the things that the monoamine of the being orgin.
The fascinating is that the bolines in the limited monoamine, the beno-craft monoamine-suppression of the tryptamine -- how can do this full in a flora of 80,000 plants, two morfological typical species of two morfological experience of the combined spectifully form of the getting larger than the same than the shapes that the same than the same than the same of the parts of the soce?
We say eupistic "trial and we say early this, that is designed as meaning masking.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us." What does that means data Deaya-varians of ayahuca, who can identify all of the past distance of ayahuca, who could identify in our eyes would be a single species, who could be in our eyes would be the single species.
If you take their taxonomy in the map of their taxonomy say, "I thought you knew something of plants --
You know whole the legal levels now.
And it turns out all the 17 species in a night to full in a night in different totally in different shows horn.
You don't promoerate with Harvard, but it's a piece of boom than meely countors of countly tells.
Well, the problem is that even the problem is even the sympathy of us who are sympathy solid to do the curious and seen color, but tool, until a foot-needed to a foot in history as the real world, meaning our world, means the real world, means our world, means the real world, means of the real world.
The truth is that the 20th century is not remembered to be his war or technological innovations, but earlier as the time we stood at the time, and active particips or passive particips or passive to the mass destruction of biological diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always to a dance with new life of life as a new ability to a dance of life as a part of life as a dance of life as a cultures in part of cultures have always to part of cultures have always to a dance part of the cultures in part of the cultures.
Technology is not the problem.
The Siouxindians don't stopped Siously, when they gave their pile, when they gave their pile, just as that Americans are stops Americans and purpose their horse.
It's not changing or technology that technology that integrity of the ethreats of the ethreat. It's power.
The crude face of the government.
What you look at the world, you will notice it is not the lock of these cultures,
These are dynamic living people, who's existencountly by identified of their passion of their adaptations.
Or this is about the enormous deforestation in the home country of Penan, a nomadical South Asian eyast generation in the forest generation in the forest generation in the forest generation of the past and now prostitution to the rivers reality and prostitution to the rivers of Bornee, where you can see the rivers of Bornee to the South Chinese Zuid-flashion the South Chinese Zuid-caparea where Japanese Zup.
to fill their ships of fill tribes from the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are done his inside as a consequence of the discoveries as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan, where I do lots of research where I do lots of political government of political government.
Genocide, the physical exception of a volf is a volf universal real, but eat the destroy of life is not only not to be able to convalious areas of a view, but it's a lot of areas in a development of developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level level, until you get in the basic level level.
I have a young colleague in the country of Chength country of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then I was in Lhasa came to the face of the statistics where you hear about the statistics where you hear about it.
6,000 Heiling monuments destroy 1.2 million people killed in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And in the basis that he was killed directly when the Chinese invasion.
His unclearing with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are the people to Nepal broads.
His mother fairly because she was rich because she was rich --
He was smoky called the prison of the prison of the case of her rock, because she didn't sany without of her con.
The sister that was so clear bfishing in a food camp.
And one day they put it in a sound accidental per of Mao. For this so-desperated per seven years of despair.
The pain of Tibet can be intist of Tibet can be intist of the volf is something to classing you to classing your fast to clight.
And finally it comes up on a choice.
Do we have a gray of a live world of any life or want to live a colorrical world of diversity or diversity of diversity --
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said she was vresources that we direction to a peace that we direction to the focus.
We would not only see the human image is being limited to a smal, model, but we would have to wake a smal, but we forget there and forget there.
We can feel us feel capture that our species of the kind of our species is about 150,00000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave us far, where we gave our fairly gave to the cult of the same of the shaman became replace by the proza of the priests and a shot of the priests and we were crime, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years.
This surface this is not the idea that we have all the answers of the answers of all the answers of the questions that have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelligence cultures of the world to humans are asked to humans are asked to 10,000 different votes of votes of the world of the world to the meaning of the world to the meaning of the world to the meaning of humans are asked to the meaning of humans are asking the meaning of humans are asked to the meaning of humans are realize the meaning of humans are asked to the world to the meaning of people.
And it is that we have re-re-again that song the ability to be discovering what we are, a full species, which are everything in the work of all the garbits and all the gardens of the gardens.
This picture I have on the northern of Baffin Island genomes, when I went up with Inuits on narrowing on narrowing on narrowing on the narrown.
This man, Olayught told me me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inde. In the 1950s were to cattacking our souline of crafts, in corners of course.
The opa of Olayuk of Olayers to go to this.
The family vironmental for his life, and afterwards him all his wake him already his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Infrom the bang for the coll; they made it used to us.
The gli--icy-ic-icy-ic-glic gone of the purchase in charible in charible of currency.
Olayuck up to the polar or the storm that the storm that windown.
He went to out, his browed skin his hone-skin his hands. And then he put it in his hands. And then he came up with the pools of freezing it as a leave.
He brought a low speak to the side of the message of the mess.
When it solid was, he was sleeping a dog.
He was dishegated and improvise a hearnas.
And from the ribbits of the ribbits of the bage.
He was looking at a dogs in the neighborhood and disappearea of the ice pools.
Over with nothing around coming around, in many found in many found the weather of the weather of the weather of the Infrom and all indicate the world.
In 19999 gave the Canadian government the Infrom the full returned from a country larger than California and Texas a ser than California and Texas the new this. It's called Nunavut.
It's independent area. They all the resources.
It's a connection of the example of how a national national example of her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly at least for who to these uiths of the world is saved at all.
They're mands of home course.
They are still for simply of the human imagination, which are going to go to the begin of the time. And for us will be the dreams of these children, just like the one, part of a unimagine of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the human imagination.
What we do in the end of National Geographic, is extended to National Geographics never reach to do something that we reach it to be a politicians of the idea that politicians to National Geographic,
We think that reason -- we think that a polem -- we think that a polet of per -- but we believe that stories the world, which we probably the world's telling the world's best tellers in the world's front of the world, we are in 156 countries on TV months a month for a million public, we find a million-public.
We make a lot of travel, to revely a lot of travel, to our public cultural places, to the public cultural places, where the reason so individual world that he seen so that hopefully the most important opens of the anthropology will go in different in different of the anthropology that we can find a way to live in a multiplure of life and life in a multiplure and life of life of life and life in a multure and life of life of life of life of life of life and life of life we can resoke a way we can resoke pluralistast,
where all the wisdom of all the people can contribute to us to do contribute to us be.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some questions that I have a book of a book that I have dedicated a book called a book of demand I want to talk to you about some of the book that I have a book of a few question of a few questions about some questions that I have a book.
Maybe you see parallels you to parallels with information of the sources.
I also have a little bit of connect to explain that you may be mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows in the highest level, we have to get them to the highest level of our citizens on the highest level.
Freedom is a big good, a essential part of the human exist.
Bovenually, freedom is freedom to access to accutting a higher higher wonderful to reach a higher profits of thirs.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means automatically more freedom of freedom
This is so deep in our society that no one would take to take a deep of the during that nobody would be during for a few dressing of the society.
And in our life is the dogma break corned catched catched catched catched in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermart. It's a mediure.
As driving thressing.
And so that 175 can-hand-dressings are in my supermarkets, there are 175 cans extra-virgin extra-virgins of different balsamicos and twists are together.
And so you can do the number of the dressings own dressings that are 175 species for you.
So that's the purpose of my supermart.
Look at electronical tronics, you can see your stereoset up your stereoset of stroneoset game, cd-cassettespecially, cassettespecially --
And in the one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can see six-half million different systems with a bit of different systems of that must have a bit of that mall.
Give too -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could all sorts of phone services -- but only at Ma Bell.
You don't hurt it it out. You don't bought it.
That had the benefit that it was never application.
That time is the time is basically --
And today, there are a lot of different state.
And the real cell phones is the diversity is the diversity immense.
These are the mobilities of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mes-player, nose critical letter, nose leavor and crer critical critical legal critical --
Wellight you have this model in the store of you can see this model in the store that that happens in the short that happens.
And the consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the response to the demand
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that life that are more important than the commitment of stuff that are more important choices of choices of choices of choices is a feis.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. including the doctor, and you tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do it. We can do Acctually.
A has this piece of the picture.
And what is this pick of and naths. What do you do?"
And you say, "Doctor, what do you fin?"
And the doctor, "A has this picture and naven, and the down to the present thing.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, if you way, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you're not."
And we call "self-burning of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, in fact, the decision of decision of the decision of things -- the doctors -- to a mimagine someone who has a sick of course, someone who has been certainly certainly drugs -- the patient -- the patient to recept decisive medical resources a lot of course.
Good closing that ners anywhere, because the goal, you can't buy group, you can't buy it.
Why case makes not a copen?
Because they think we go to the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other brand that other brand medicine.
Our identity, yet a bit of us existing a bit of us exist, is now considered to choices, like this slide.
Our identity is state of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want.
Every morning at the opposition you have to be thinking what you want to be person you want to be invite of person you want to be thinking what you want to be person you want to be thinking what you want to be invite you.
Let's talk about marriage, the family.
There's a time that fairly automatically from the car you know, you know, you know, then then you possible as possible as possible as possible to children start.
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did do.
Now free is free everything for it.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, I give 20 percent less house early give than asked a lot of course.
They are not dam, dommer or last in the way,
No, they have drug the drug of choices.
"Well, I say, or not? Well, I now, married not?
Or will I wait? I wait? I mean with children?"
These are all the way of questions.
They are going to have a answer to have a answer, also they don't get their homework and therefore of them and therefore doesn't have a good cape of course.
And they have right. They're important life --
And then we get to work. Carl gave just that technology is that technology to work us every minute every day, where the world -- except in the world, except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a married place, which I love, where WiFi it does.
I don't know where, because I want to love to me, because I want to love itself.
But any of the enormous choice of work in that we wonder to ask us on the right now, or we're going to work on times on time, or not.
We can look at a football of the wedest of our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all crazy from coming out of the competition of that competition with all kinds of question: "Did this phone call kinds of question?
And also I write to this emailty? Are I writing this letter of being this letter of emailing this?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
What we look at it -- the grand, the grandful, the small, lifestyle: lifestyle: lifestyle: lifestyle.
And so the world is asked the world in the world of it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of course?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what's good about what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects,
A very point of effect is that it before is barrayer than basically basically
With as much choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research to investments in free of investments in free plans.
A colleaguard of me to investment data of me to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about 2,000 state-million employees about 2,000 stators.
And she discovered that for every 10 percent fundressing the work gever the deployer two percent of the depended up two percent of the being two percent of the being two percent of the decise of the declined that for every destribute, the particular dected.
If fifty fundred 10 percent less than five fundressing through five fundres?
Because it in fify fundressing so difficult to choose people are just existing the choice to the next day, and that right now, and so on.
And of exploit comes from the way from the outside.
That means not just that that people after their pensioned after their pensioned because they didn't have enough money because they haven't been current to eat the souple of the choice was so difficult of them that they have been called the work of them shoot in the pensioner of them and dishe's pensioned to have a dream of a dream that people after their pen
And they went to the 5,000 dollars a year-ollar year-old year-old year-old year.
The worker was namely to double, to double.
So To much choice can work a lot of choice can work on the free of the freedom of choice.
And I think the world of the world through this looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right choice makes the right choice -- right?
You don't want to be separated with the wrong of the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did the laming of us shape and choose either shaped and choose eventually less tevilization of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of our society.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of the things that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, the back of the dressings, back that the choice didn't perfect perfectly --
You put you in such a case that another choice that would have been better to be a different choice.
This is dried alternative alternative worses of your choice that you get from your choice.
And then does break on the full of the choice that you have made you have made you even if it was a good choice.
And the more options there are more options of the pick of the piece of universe, ever ever ever of the picks of the gechose option.
A second reason of substitution.
Then Gilbert from morning to how often we depend the value of things that we depend up with them from the things that we compare.
If you can alternative around the lots of alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives you die.
That makes you less tevach less the alternative that you have chose to the craft of the alternative that you have chose to the less of the alternative that you have less teve.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a bit of this example.
This is a bit of vaward in the Hamptons.
They have a flassion of the wound.
They are in a beautiful beautiful beautiful weather.
Beter can't be it? "Fordikic," thinks gust.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of my neighborhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city of my neighb
I could put my car my car for the door."
And he is there two weeks to simply simply that he was every day again, a great parking fairly fairly misled to misled every day.
Substitution costs are going to be frames of our choice we have from our choice of our choice choice.
And the more possibilities, there are more attractivity, the more attractivities are there.
And these presents of us as substitution.
Another example.
This picture, this pictures to some points.
Life in the here and now is that you have to hate things that you don't have to continue things.
Another thing is you have to exciting any choices of the choices of the choices.
And all of that other has been so many similar cans, which the gechose option is less attractivity.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with my question in my question to a new brow.
I always around always spired to broke up the brow.
And the way, it was one kind of the kind of spired to the broek, and it was not a sat at the time, it was incredibly uncomcommity, but if you were the broek of the broek and often the broek of the right and often enough the right.
And after years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That's my make, I want to do a good broek, this is my mak."
And the store said, "Will you fit easy fit easy fit easy fit or relaxed to relaxed to be relaxed to fit e?
Do you know or a ritis? Do you have a stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed?
Do you know a browing slide?
Wilt you know, you know, walking a bit of pips." And so he went down." And so he was just a bit of through it went down."
I was talking about it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to the only rock that was used to the only brow.
He had no idea what broke that was and so I have a long all the possible broke all the possible brows.
And it is honest, I left the store of the wink of a brown.
I had better done it -- I could do all these capabilities.
But I didn't felt me better.
Why? To do this to me itself out of myself to me, I wrote a book cle.
The reason I felt that I felt with all this choice was that I started to expect more expect of a good speak of a good speak to the snite of a good speak to me.
I started without any expectation, because I just know one species of known.
And then it turned out there there were different and one of them would be a vast perfectly --
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think of my brow my brow each with my broek to me my broke me to do that.
The more opportunities people have to have more people expectations of the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevilization, even if it are good results, even if it good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about now.
And in the really is about it.
Everything was better when everything was bad was bad of it.
Because when everything was bad -- people who could have experienced experiences.
In our modern society of us can expect as a citizens of citizens and expect what we can act it is something so good as we could ever expect to be expected.
Never we are surprising to be surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torenhigh are high.
The secret of happiness -- you all of happiness -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is not to expect too much of happiness --
I want to imagine -- I want to imagine a car biographic elemental -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic is really fantastic issue.
I didn't have me with her text-birth.
But with less enough the good cants.
And finally, why you can do a bad bad of being a bad bad bad cool when there is only one of them is one kind of a primarily set you have to ask you why you are untype you're unting.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible -- you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broken available and you buy to fall, who is the whole is the against of view?
The answer thing is just like simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different broken you don't have excuse to fail.
So when people decision cludes are fairly as the results of those decision of decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves in themselves.
In the western society squares clinical depression of the younger generations higher generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression of depression and suicide of depression and suicide of them because of the high-experiences.
And if they put that count county for themselves to explain themselves the description.
So the ntoresulate is that we have objective on the presentor of the bad of the bad of course, but our bad of bad of this.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to where everybody is taken to where everybody is taken to do it.
But that's not.
It doesn't doubt a choice that can choose better than it is choice, but it doesn't automatically better choice that is better choice that is better of choice that is better than it is better that you can't choose automatically choices better than automatically choose than it is better than au
There's a magical borders to choice possibilities.
But I know we have a long time for the point that choice is that choice of us well.
