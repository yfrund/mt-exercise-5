Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, that the last three million years, about the last three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this underestimate the serion of this particular problem because it doesn't show.
The ice kap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crach in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a fasted version of what's happened 25 years.
The permanent ice, the permanent ice in red.
As you can see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And it cracross the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, or five years or older, is almost like flower, that from the body's body here.
In 25 years of this went of this.
And that is a problem because the frozen ground the North Icelebrate around the Northern Icelity warms and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon carbon diase, when it's designed by microbes in methane.
Some of the total amount of engineering in the atmosphere, could double, that could double, if we could double the corner point.
In a few indicate in Alaska Borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey wind Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with a different team to a different team to a different team
Whoo! She's OK. The question is that we will be.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than ever.
This is the Kangerlussua-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea level because the land-myself, because the landics, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These streams are taking down.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And last month reported to report scientists that the entire continent now has a negative ice balance balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly, very quicklands.
The whole continent is six feet for six feet, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the only two after greatest ice mass, there are now new now that have a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population, half of his drinking water of that mely.
In the Andes, this gla source of drinking water for this city.
There are now.
But when they're disappeared, the drinking water.
In California, there was a reduce of 40 percent in the snow.
It comes back in the water reservoires.
And as you could read it.
This global dramatic dramatic dramatic rise of forests.
And the number of nature around the world is crossing with an incredible and never seen sped.
Four times in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intention.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we've added 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean from the Stille Ocean, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic drification of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great cause of the global warming of the Earth, next to 20 percent money, is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and along is a problem, and it's all greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest stoters, together with China.
And there was a propose to build a lot more cool carbons.
But we're seeing a reverse.
These are the voice carbon carbon that the building became annul in the last few years, and where green alternatives were presented in the last few years.
There's a political battle on the country.
And the voice carbon and oil industraight year, 250 million dollars to promot, which is a carbon carbon clean carbon carbon crity.
And that image me about this.
Around the currise was in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of billion gallon.
You've probably seen the news.
This is the size of one after size in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising caught strium around the Kerst.
Video: "Frosty called "Frosty glman is a black guy.
He is overflension here in America, and he's concerned that our economy.
Frosty the voice becomes with the day.
He's pay and cutting and cutting their job."
Here's a big part of the voice in West Virginia.
The biggest mine worker of the country is the great bigs of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they're talking about."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of this.
Video "ALergy, we see COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat.
That is the reason why the most important purpose is to giant a giant goal to the light.
Fit is not smart.
We think it's clean clean clean clean.
So, you can't worried about corning climate change.
And let me leave to us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean carbon carbon carbon carbon.
Fantastic! The machines are best.
But that is the sound of clean cool technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the fact that burning carbon of global warming causes of global warming, changes the remarkable, the remarkable carbon technology that you see here.
Look at right, this is the clean carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Al Gore: the positive alternative to our economic challenges and that on national security of national security.
Video: Stem: America in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security crisis.
And the red of all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pile colls and inported oil.
But now there is a new solution, new solution to get out of this.
Before America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America plan to work again, a plan that makes us safer and global warming.
And eventually, a solution which is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's absolutely again.
One of the fastest ways to make an end.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 22: New investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speak that says, "If you want to be quickly.
If you want to go together."
We have to go, and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here. So here's one of the ones that didn't be the LHC is the biggest scientific experimental experiments, 27 kilometers.
It needs to the circumstances that were present less than a billion-billion after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
On 10 September last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That careful for a party.
It's a photograph of the first particle classed around the LHC wently around the LHC, and with a piece with a piece of the LHC, in the detector.
With other words, when we were seeing that photograph on 10 September we did that the machine.
I don't know whether this is the biggest right, or this, or this, or somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we've made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to have a problem with these golds.
They're doing 13 thousands of 13 thousand the machine on follow.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small weight."
They can do that because they're superceive on whole temperature.
So at min 271, colder than the space between the stars, who can draw down.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
That became a little bit warmer, and there was a little bit of electrical resistance that 13 thousand amper nets.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realize your realize that the magnets more than 20 centimeters, and they were about 30 inches.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out, what we did.
We've all recently.
Now they're back away.
Eind, the LHC will be again.
We're going to put it again, and we expect measure in June, so that we can figure out what the building the building of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, those accidents, the debate of the value of scientific research research.
I think the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we go beyond beys, the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the list of English scientist Humphrey Davy Davy Davy, I decided in the words of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangergerous about the advances that our images of the human minds of science beings are completely in nature that our imagins are completely definitely, that our being completely are completely definishing that our over."
Thank you.
I'd like to start asking you back to ask back to your childhood, when you played with block.
When you discovered how to figure out how to figure out, and conscious problems of space and learning space and corporating space and depending space relationships.
Rumultiply insight, because understanding the world to understanding the world around us.
If an information, inspired by physical interaction with physical interaction with objects -- together with my advisior Pattion and my fellow Jeof Kalanithi -- I started to ask -- what if we could use a computer, in place that one mouse of mouse as a kind of digital fingerial fingerations as a moving.
and orders as we want?
This question that question that we decided that we decided that we decided by the building of Siftables.
Shortly, a Sift is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can move each other, their movement, detect and contains a screen and wireless contact.
And the physical accore is the physical accority, as blocks they can be moved by understand.
Anyway, Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
Because these tools have a more physical differences, are aware of their movement and each other, and even of the way we move, and even of the way we move, there are different new and nice interactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is incredible to show a video celement, which is playing, and otherwise plays, and otherwise plays.
These interactive portraits are awareness.
At next to each other, they will be interesting.
If they become surround, they can do this and can be able to be able to do this and can be able to currently.
And they feel movement and hell.
And we realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interesting of everyday, as it was a fluid, as it was a liquid of color, as it was a fluid,
Now, in this example three Siftables, and I can use them to get color, and I can use them to get color in a empty where they're miled.
If we have drive, we pick up what we're back.
There are a few cappe possibilities for education, mathematics with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to try and try to see the result immediately.
Here I'm -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a simplace.
Here's a game between a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in each raround a randomly letter on each Siftable, and caseed words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds, it becomes about 30 seconds, and appears a new series of letters of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are a few of children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I put it out to try and make a video.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to nearly instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make words and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That is our young business, right.
It's just the Siftable.
For him were just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting shown.
We wanted to learning a platform for learning language.
This is Felix.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift with that character of the table.
He let late here.
Video: The Sun up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Yeah! Yeah!
Because of Siftable, and the next to places each other, he can react the characters with each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it walk.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I'm going to show that Is is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recent recent recent recent recently, where every Siftable.
One has four different variations, where you can choose what you want.
This sounds can be injected in empty Siftable, so that you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern through the pattern of a empty Siftable effects are live controlled as reverb and filter.
They're being a sound and admitted by side.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftable, to a first patroon, until a lead.
Now, I place the basly.
Video: DM: Well, I feed a little bit slagwork.
Video: DM: And now I put the filter to the filter on the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate it by the side of the obviously.
Video: DM: Well, I put the filter to the filter to the base for what more expression.
Video: I can recognize the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to do everything, but I can improvise it, but I can improvise it all longer and corter as I want.
With eventually the dims of the whole through the volume left Sift to left.
Thank you.
And, as you can see, my passion to make new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and work.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this designed in this designed with some new elemental possibilities that we're developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the touch a new generational resources to the interact with digital media, that bringing the information to the world as we want.
Thank you from heart.
I'm looking at it to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I've already obviously, and I don't think it's going to change.
And yet there is a recently, recently happened in my life and career, where I had to see my relationship with my work.
It started with a book that I wrote recently, a memoire, "Eten, Biddle, that was very opposed to my earlier world and was very international before the whole world and an international existence.
And the consequence is that people now and always have to pull down everywhere.
Well, really, true --
People come to me and ask to me and ask you, "Don't you scared this success?
Are you not afraid you're going to write your entire life will writing your whole life will be publish?
Are you not afraid there?"
Because reasonably, you know.
Of course, that would be. But I remember 20 years ago, 20 years ago -- I was when a teenager, when I write.
People said, "Don't you afraid you will never be success?
Don't you afraid for it.
Don't you afraid that your life on this work without of this work without of bits and that you're going to die on your broken on your broken with your broken with your broken bitters of bitter?"
Something in that strets.
And in the short comes to the short answer, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things.
all the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things, you don't know that for a lot of other things.
For instance, for example, and different things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time, where that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is the logical that somebody is afraid to be afraid to the work for the work for the work that they put on Earth?
What is so particular about creative processes that we're worried to creative processes of the effects on the spirity, something that is not happening.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember, and I can't remember that in 40 years, he has asked to be afraid he didn't fright.
And this is "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, it didn't work about it.
To be fair to be fair fair engineers have also not the reputation also not the reputation of the reputation depressive alcoholists.
Writers that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have a reputation mental reputation mentally instable.
Now, just look at the griming death of the most magnifical creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often young,
And even the ones that have no suicide of suicide to be suicide to be obviously.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "With of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of this sort of course, we don't see anymore.
We've all heard it before, and we've heard it all the accepted.
And the heard thought is that creativity understanding with suffers and eventually connected to suffer.
That's why do I want everybody here today: can you ask with that idea of life?
Fields do that OK?
Because I agree about it, I think about it, I don't think about the pretty thought.
I find the refus.
And also dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century.
We can creative mind a lot better to life.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to live.
Searly seen the phase where my careers now.
Anyway, I'm young, am young, against years.
I can still a four decade of decades.
Now, highest everything will I'll get everything that now have publicer by the outside work that extraordinary successful book successful book.
We are friends here with friends, so I can clapping you, it probably likely my biggest success of my biggest success behind me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think, if you're going to think, you're going to know at the morning for nine hourselves again.
So I don't want to do that.
I love up with the work I love with the work I love.
And the question is: "How?"
And after long after long after a long time, that I can only go through a psychological protection in the process.
And I need to write a safe distance between myself between myself, and my over, very understanding for the reactions on my future publications.
I've been looking at the last year for ways to do.
I did in the history of history and have depends in other civilizations to see or others have found a better way to help creative people to try creative people to go with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My question has brought me to the ancient Greeks and Romains.
Let op, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Roman and believed people didn't believe that creativity comes from itself.
People believed that creativity was a killing spirit was a divable place to humans around and unknowledable reasons.
The Greeks called these minutes of creativity called "demonen."
On Socrates believed he had a demoon that he had a demon, who influenced.
The Romeins had a kind of equal idea.
One of them called a geniused creative mind a "genius."
And the funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their exactly was a genius kind of magical entities that came up in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists was working, the genius of assistence.
He was working shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
And the artists became so protection, for example to a lot of narcism.
If you brilliant, you got brilliant there.
Everybody knew that is an invisible geniusible you had holpe.
Do you want to work on you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time, the long time is how in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There was a whole new idea: the individual humans is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures from the divine world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity came from the individual.
And for the first time, in history of artists were saying about artists that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say honestly that I think a big mistake.
To individual, one person, only individual individual that he or she's fiel, the essentially, the source of the century mystery mystery, of everything -- and known, creative and known, that is too much too much to a fragile human psyche.
Anybody anybody asking,
Egos are blowing up to human proportions and there are incredibly incredible high expectations.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists.
If that, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do?
Can we understand back an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Well we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of spech.
Probably sit in the audience people who have red saved scientific doubt about the idea that elphachieve creatures with some feeding the work of artists of artists to inspiring artists.
It doesn't seem to be getting you.
I won't ask it up.
Why not?
Why shouldn't we have that thought?
It's just as much wood as much well-explanations of the total explanations that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact -- so in fact, in fact, all the presents -- it doesn't always the creative process.
That sometimes almost paranoral.
I've recently recently, the great American close Ruth Stone.
She is close in the nine. Her whole life already life.
She told me about her running Virginia.
Sometimes, when she was working on the field, she heard a poem on the country.
It was, so says, as though there was a big wave air came up with it.
And poem poem poem wave about the country to her it.
She felt that the grounds under her under her feel started shaking her on that point her at that point on that point her lives for her life.
And she followed home, followed through the poem and see them as quickly possible.
When the poem through her her holves was her only to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then running and run, but reached the house.
And in such moments shot schools poem through her it, looking about the fields, search -- in her words -- to a different close --
Anywas, there were a message -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they near the poem -- they're almost beautiful.
And then she was in home looking for and paper and paper and paper, the poem through her it.
Juist on that moment she had a pencil of pencil.
And with her other hand, so told me she picked the poem from the air.
She picked the poem with his tail, and put it back back in her body, while she wrote.
And in that cases came up in that cases of piece of paper, but then in fact, then in ordered order.
When I heard, I thought -- what I thought my creative process.
This is what my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I am a mile, which every day on the same time, that every day and flowered with blood, sweat and trans flower.
But even in that daily heavy I had suddenly such a experience.
You're also going to know it myself, that feeling that there are creative ideas in your board from a source that you can identify your impossible.
What is that befor?
How can we use it without that without we can use it?
At a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think that I can think I can think is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
And we had it about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life has been showed the shown of the great artist that resources out of all power to get to the unfortable creative impable creative impactable creative impantable creative impantable creative impact.
With the 1990s.
On one day he referred in Los Angeles, and changed the process.
And while he was doing there, he heard a fragmental of a meloddie.
It decided to him, like inspiration that fail is doing, improvement.
It was a beautiful nice and he wanted to hold the hold.
But it didn't.
He didn't have a piece of piece, no table.
And the amazing exciting exciting exciting exciting the melods, and then it turns out the melods.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry that I behind?"
"Do you really think I can write a sing?
If you really want that this song come, you have to get later again, if I have time for you.
That's not, somebody else did somebody else difficult.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohently from that point to the process very different.
The work itself is even the same thing with the famous underto.
But the heavy exciting the creative process of him distance, when he distance, when he distance.
The geniused to close on the skin and close to the skin.
Tom realized that there was no reason for it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizard collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owneral aspect that wasn't quit.
That story has changed.
I've already profession of it.
I was in the middle I was writing Eten, Biddle.
At a given moment I am in despair.
You know that well: you know, you don't want to be good and you think it's a terrible disaster, and you think it's a terrible disaster.
Not just horribad, really horribly horrible ad.
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was to be a genius, and I decided to way.
And I wishing me from my manuscript and I founded to a empty corner of the room.
And I said, "Listen though this, "Listen we all know that if this book is not brilliant, it's not just by me.
You can see everything I have.
I can't give you.
If you find it better can, you've got to do you.
Do you don't do that, right? Do you can't do that.
I just write to write because that's the one of my work.
Oh, and in the notular nots, and in the not-today."
Tjage -- eventually it down here.
Enviews came in the North African desert people in the North African desert.
Uring and hours and hours and back, to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very extraordinary.
One of those dance was than transcendent.
And you know what I mean, you know, what I mean by that, you have ever seen in a performer.
It was as if the time, and the dance, and dance through a paper.
And he did nothing else than the thousands of nights, but now everything together.
He suddenly seemed a human being.
In him, underneath him, above him.
A fired fired fire.
If such something that happened, knew people did what it was Dan they started to clapping and crossing, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a nice historical factor: When the Mors South South Spani Spanishment, they broadling this communic.
And the question has changed by the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oy."
And that hear you heard today at the day, and flamengodances and flamengodance.
As an artist, in Spanist of an artist, or magically, saying, "Allah, Allah, oy: "Allah, Allah, broad."
Oh, understand see: a glimpse of God.
People what we need.
Lastig is that the dance, the dance of the next morning was discovered that he discovered on dinary 11 hours in the morning.
Because that moment is it against a little older guy that may never before that maybe never to such hights.
Maybe never going to have anybody God anybody dance.
What is he still now with the rest of his lives?
That's hard.
That's really difficult for a creative mind.
But it doesn't need to be.
Now, imagine you're not going to be the most unusual aspects of your person come from yourself.
Now, imagine you believe that you have a whiled to be a whiled of a not nather specificate.
And when you're ready ready ready, they're talking about somebody else.
This is how everything.
I high inside that thought.
And the last months I've been working on a book that inside short will be looked at where much too long time. It book a lot of time.
And the follower of that illuster progress.
If my thought with me on the hold, I keep the same force: Don't running the same thing that doesn't fright.
Do just your work.
you just do this, whatever it is.
If your task is to dance, then dance.
If the charge geniused to decision of your work at work in your work at a point of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources, "Ole.
Now, does not, dance then dance you.
And so, "Ole.
I believe that.
"Ole, whatever, because we pure out of pure human love and ownwisdom.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can meaning, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean,
We actually start from a new point from a new point, we were the biology at digitizing, and now we're trying to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology, with the design and synthesizing life.
So we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is living a lot of biologists have tried to understand to understand on different levels.
We've tried different approach to minimal components.
We're now almost 20 years.
When we have sequence, when we have sequenced, it went from the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now do we try to questioning, can we live regenerate, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a species that can multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to see whether we can get to a nonly smaller genome.
We can put in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simple, is that relatively comparishing relatively.
Belief me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes, we look at all the genes that we can probably per piece, it's very unlikely that this would be a life.
So we decided that the only route forward to synthesizing this chromosome of this chromosome of the components to synthesize the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetics?"
Now, the chemistry the chemistry great molecules that we've never seen befor?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome of start?
A chromosome, by the way, by the way, but a piece of chemical inert material.
So, our tempo of the digitizing life is accelerating life is accelerate.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code.
And our last point would be place at this moment curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethical responsible to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it.
So we had to put a new method of method to piece of these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes.
And this was our first trying to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, did the wrong correction,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we started a piece of chemical in the bacteria piece of chemical code, and the bacteria genetic code genetic code.
And the viral particles were classed from the cells, they came back after that, then the E.
I was understood in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model just too wn.
They laughts more than you.
That's why we think this is a situation where the software the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
That's why we decided to build them in cassettes of viruses, so that we could figure out the cassettes --
And to understand what the real components of a living cell cell.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer than the digital information is very digital information in the computer than
When we first put together this genome in 1995 was the standard in 1995, the standard of 10,000 baseparations.
And eventually, we found after resequencing 30 mistakes. If we used the original sequence than it had been able to start.
And part of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build it together.
We design here unique unique.
Maybe you've read to stop.
I think about this: we have a squartery genetic code: A, C, C, Gently and T.
Trios of those letters of letters of code for 20 aminose -- that there is a letter cupon for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write the genetic code.
At a signed of course, we only called "Well,
Some of some of them were poems that there were no poems.
We've designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they put and in each other.
And we've started piece of piece, starting with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long time, and you have piece of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters, take up to 72,000.
In each stadium we could get a continue of these pieces so that we could sequence to sequence a process because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust --
We're trying to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate basevices -- then they don't grow that easy more in E.
That resources it out of all the modern tools of the molecular biology.
That's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist called "homologist is used by the biology to called DNA, that pieces together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococococococococococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurance.
And you see that in the upper panel, such a chromosome.
12 hours later 24 again, he put it into each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be completely up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space, that can be moved in space, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has a marry shows that there is a lot of this.
Here's a real microphotograph of the molecule that we've created with these processes -- actually, with just gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did.
Gist makes that they're automatically together.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a regular microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken over a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we've recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule, is more than 300 million.
If we would pressure it with a 10-points letter, without spations, without 142 pages pages only to pressure the genetic code.
Well, how do we start a chromosome, how do we activate it?
With a virus is pretty clearly.
With a bacterium is a lot of complicat.
It's also simpleer if you like, underneath you're just simply under the ckern from and does another in, and that's what you know if you clone.
At the bacteria species integrated in the cell, but we have a full transplation, but we have a full transplant transplantation of a chromosome of the cell transplant to another, and can activate it.
We have a chromosome.
These are about so far from each other, if people and mous.
And we put some extra gently so that we could select for this chromosome.
We've been reflect with enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensationally, when we put this in the cell -- and you'll put the very advanced graphic images here.
We even thought he's going to come up to be, but we tried to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of types that have a second chromosome, or a third of thousands of properties have a thousands of properties in one times.
People that evolution evolution evolution to change a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzyms who are actually called DNA.
And the chromosome, in the cell has not one.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- well,
And it became expressed, and it recognize the other chromosome of the other chromosome material, and so why we had the cell of the new chromosome.
He became blue because of the genes we had stop.
And in a very short time disappearing all the characteristics of the one species, and changed completely in the new kind of based in the new kind of based.
All proteins changed, the membranes changed -- when we turned the genetic code, it was changed.
This makes sounds as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Good, I've already before that this is not a creation -- this is pretbreak on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I've been pay to be a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to take from six and a half into nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on these planets,
for each of us who lived in 1940 years, within 40 years.
We've been trying to food, with cleaning clean water, medications, fuels, fuels, fuel, fuel on-half billion.
That is difficult to do that for nine.
We're using five billion ton coals, more than 30 billion.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes of biological process than any process to replace.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And through all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see when the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dozens of components, and look at the diversity that has come out there.
We've limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've now danks through thanks fastly synthesemethods to do the combination genomics."
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot,
And if you think about the work of 20 million different genes, or trying to optimize processes to optimize octan, or medicines, new vaccines, new vaccines, we can change more molecular biology are in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccine.
This is a screen mafic image of what real design that we work on the computer, so that you can actually design a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We focused on fourth generations.
One of you have seen lightly seen, just a bad experiment.
We've second generation and third generation of fuels will come from coming from sugar fuels like sugar fuels like octan or fuels like octan, or different kinds of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price without of the food price higher and the availability is if we start with CO2 as are food supplies and designs that moves it in that way, and we think we're doing the first cell cells in about 18 months, and we think that we're doing the first fired generation.
Sollight and CO2 is method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea half kilometers deep, with coined temperature.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at if we can do CO2 we can take CO2, which is easily accustomized to factories, where the CO2 becomes back CO2 back to the fuel, to send this process.
So in a short of time, we think we are able to break on the basic question, "What is living on the basic question: What is life?"
We've really, we actually have the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED.
A important energy.
But we are also using these tools to use these tools to think quickly,
This year was the flu, we always just behind the facts when it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by combined vaccinated vaccines.
Here's how the future can see the future is going to change through the evolution tree, changing accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, archaed, and eventually, archaed, and eventually.
We're still away from the improving people.
Our goal is certainly to sure that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that may be doing. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you, quickly, is the fundament of a new technology that we spent to a new technology that we brought to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment where you local local or with immense amounts of visual data.
We're looking at a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can zooms, and making up here, navigate, navigate and the sort of wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information, how big these collections or images.
Most of this, most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It all does nothing because the only thing because the only thing would influence influence, on a such system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is a gray home of Dickens. Every coal is a chapter.
To prove that it's really text texts, and no imagination, we can do something like this, to show that this is really text; this is not imagination.
Maybe this a little bit weird way to read a book way to read a book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine, which is actually a scale paper, which is actually a scale medium.
We've also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We've made a nep advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the opportunities of these car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really worried that we can actually do the limitations of actions can do through the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and different flaure.
Of course, of course, is a before to a technology like this, I won't spending this one, like this, I won't spending, except that we can contribute this field --
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And pictured on a image of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer-vision research of Washington the University of Washington the University of Washington.
and Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-deeply resolution.
The space of the images of the images has meaning.
The computer-vision algorithms have been brought these images together, so that they are coming to the real room -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadise Rockies -- where they're genomes of stabilized diashws or panorama and panorama and panorama and all these things are spaced.
I don't know sure whether there is, other environments.
There are a lot of space.
I want to like a Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the real force I have in my head is the real force of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to do with the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dampush with images from Flickr. You search in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and like this.
And each of these oranges gives an imagination being part of this model.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are in this way of course, which are basically,
And we can navigate.
You know, I had never thought I've ever thought I would ever work.
It's overwhelming.
I believe you can see that these many types are cameras are cameras, everything from reflexcameras, a big number of it.
I'm trying to find some weird images.
There are so much covered through faces and such it.
There's a series of photographs is even a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also goodged by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say this is that we can actually do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory, on the other.
All these photographs become with each other, and shapes together than the parts.
You've got a model that from the entire Earth.
Here's a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work.
And this is something that grows in complexity in complexity when it uses to use the benefits grow for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are before.
If somebody would want to attack all these saccess and their names and their names, my photographs, my photographs, and I can use this data, and I can use this data, and I can use that metaph, that metaphor, using everybody's photos, and creating everybody, and created a kind of cross-modal, and creatory social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social of all of all of all of thviety modalves.
And of course, is the key product of this.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible to a day in the next years, all the images that are shared by everyone on the world?
BA: Yeah. What this really does discover.
It creates on your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does base of the data in the images.
And that is getting exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information which is a lot of these images.
And when you look for the web looks for images, you get a search for the web page, and the text on the web page of what the image is a lot of information about what the imagination about the image.
What is the image of imagination?
Then the number of semantic connectic connections and the amount of wealthy that comes out of that, and it's a classic. It's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of the intense natgraphic research is the possibility to life between they're not forgotten to forget the ancient wind, who are still feeling their pasts, the tract of wind, the profitterists, the profitter.
And the science that Jaguar-shamans still before to the Milky Way, or that the myths of In, or that the myths of Instead, or that in the Himalaya bood-hunt hundred hunt hunt on the bresponsible of Dharma, you reading the world of Darma, remember is not going to live in an absolute sense, but it's a model of the world of mode, but is a model of the world --
the consequence of a result set of adaptation choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all shared the same adaptation: Worn born. Bring kids in the world.
We're all making inducation rhything.
Because the inconnection by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we're all sings, dances and art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is about the Pension in the forests of Borneo, or the Voo-acolies in the Kaisute or the Caisut in the Kaisut-Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-Kenya, the Caravanserai in the heart of the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the Sahara. -- -- or now a month, a month, a months of Qomolangling --
Everest, the God mother of the world.
They're all learning us to be differently, differently, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope.
Some of the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and cultural is as important as the biological life.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a eat.
You can define as the totally you define as the totally of all the thoughts, dreams, mythes, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are continuous human imagination and intuitions that are consciousness.
And the nature is the great nalating of humanity.
She is the symbol of all that we can be, and all that we can be astonishing curious species.
just like the biosphere is heavy heavy is heavy -- and still in many greater mate.
No biologist would take a biologist that at least half of all kinds of extinctive, because that simply is not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptical scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this.
When everybody here was born here was born six thousand languages.
A language is more than her words or her grammatic rules.
A language is a flight of human soul.
It's the view that the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Each language is a centural, a separation, a separation, a thought, an ecosystem to spiritual opportunity.
From that six thousand languages today, half the day half of the children.
They're not longer longer.
Effective means that, unless a change, that they're already death.
Is there anything else than ancestors by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your language, not to have the wisdom of the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the kids of the kids of the children.
People that is somebody's legal state every two weeks of weeks on the Earth, because every two weeks of weeks again, and with him the last last letter-good language.
Some of you say, 'Some of you say, "Well, the world don't be better of the same languages?" I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba. I say, "Super. Or Kantonees.
Or Kogi." you will realize your own language.
So what I really want to do today is going to take you on a short journey through the eat, which has got to sketch a picture of what is lost.
Many of us forgotten that when I'm talking about being a different way of being a different way of being a very different ways.
For instance, this Barasana child in the North west Amazon the anaconda, the anaconda, the anaconda, that believes that she floves from the critical snes.
This is a people, cognitive the colors blue and green not distinction, because it wonderful, because it's wonderfully equired to the wonderful.
They have a falling language-marriage rule, which is called linguistic exogamy is called somebody say: you need to somebody who speak a different language.
These are roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary following in their homes, where six or seven languages are spots, but you never never before a language.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinated tribes that I've lived the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a amazing people.
Well, in 1957, five missionaries, but they made a critical mistake.
And then the air streamed photographs of themselves from itself to our idea's friendly getting a two-dimensional picture.
They photographs and tried to figure out the face behind the face.
When they didn't found anything, they concluded that the piled of thup, which is the missionaries, and then the missionaries.
But the Waorani didn't just outside outside, but also each other.
five percent of their mortality came out of the fiftings.
We could tract genealogies to eight generations back to eight generations, where we did two cases of a natural deat.
When we went through, they gave that one man ever did that one man ever diever died from olderdom -- and then he was born. But at the same time, they had an amazing same amazing knowledge.
Their hunters could hunters on 40 40 passes and tell what species was smell of it.
Begin 1980s, I got an amazing operation, when my professor me, when my professor I whether I wanted to go to Haiti to infile secret out of the power of the power of the power of president Duvalence as well.
To sensational things, what to understand what to understand what to understand something about this particular belief of Vodoun belief of black magic.
It's a complex metaphysically, very interesting.
Would I ask you the great world religions, what would you say that?
Christihism, islam, booddhism, etc.
One continent is always outside, from the assumption that Africa didn't believe that Africa no religious believe. Natural had a religious believed this.
Voodoo is simply simply the destile of the religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora in the tragic diaspora during the slavery.
What foodoo interesting is so interesting between the living and deaths and kill the deaths.
The living basically.
The spirits can be touched from under the Great Water, answer on the dance of the living temporary of the living temporary of the living time, so that during one during the follower becomes the well.
That's why I love to say, "You're going to go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and become God." And because you're so concerned by the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a makes a certain trance that shows in trance that punishing.
This is the ability to demonstrates the possibility of the mind to influence the body.
From all of all the people I have ever lived with, are the Kogi the most extraordinary, a whole of Colombia.
African civilization of the Tairona civilization, which ever the Cariban coastfly.
They went back in an isolated in an isolated volcanic mass above that above the coastflat flat.
Well, in a blood blow through continent was never continent through the Spanishments.
And then become increasingly by ritual prieship, but the training is pretty pretty result.
And the young acoly, the young of their families when they're three or four.
They're being separated in a world of substance, in stones of glaciers, 18 years, 18 years.
Two periodds nine year, aware of nine year, to get the nine months of the nine months that they're in the schools of their mother.
Now they're talking about speak in the lap of the big mother.
This whole times the society values, the society values that can take the point of the cosmic or ecological or ecological or ecological -- balance in state.
This increments with the day ended with the day that she came outside and for the first time, if they are 18 in their life, if they're 18 and see that clear moment of consciousness of the first lighting landscape with her lights with her lights of her light crowned in full glorious say that she learned in following glorious say,
"Hay? It's like I'm saying you've saying you.
And so beautiful is beautifully to protect themselves the older brothers.
According to them are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
On this point is the intuits is very important.
If we think of indicate and landscape, we often think of Rousseage and the ancient fability to the ancient fabul, an idea that racistic is racistic in its simplicity is in simple.
Or we take it from Thoreage and say that these are closer to the Earth than us.
Inity, indicately sentimentally, nor by nor by nostalgy.
For both is a few space in the malariaxes of the Asmate or in the Asmate winds of Tibet. Despecially have a traditual may be a traditional mystically a traditional mystical myth of the Earth is basically, but on a much subtle, but on a much subtype of the Earth itself.
What meaning? It mean? It means that a little child from the Andes, which is grown up with the belief that the mountain a spirit has a fundamental different and a fundamentally different and a different relationship from Montana, and a different relationship from Montana, great child by the idea that the mountain.
Or it the living place of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor who define define define between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests forests to be capital.
That made me a different humans than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forests believe that these forests forests from Kux: The cromel and the Kromme Snavel and cannibal minds that are in the north of the world.
These mind are important during their Hamatsa-invision.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary discovery.
It's a photograph I jever april in the North west Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayage is fascinating so fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it. It's built from two sources.
Enersense, there is a woods, like, hearmine carboline, harmaline and harmaline in itself-hallucinating works.
If you just take the plant -- it seems that a blue rookwalm by your consciousness.
The plant is mixed with leaves of a coffee, Psychotria viridis.
The plant powers powerful tryptamines, because of brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they snow that snoves, that substance of different kinds of methoxyltryltryptamine?
That power nose in blower nose is being shot being shottered with baro images, to countries on a sea of electricity of electricity. This does no form of the reality of the reality.
I was tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convincing the psychedelic age -- a man who discovered the psychard in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I painted that these tryptamines are not to identify as hallucinated as hallucinating, because when the effect his infect, there is nobody more home to experience. Tryptamines are not oral. Tryptamines, because they're designed by an enzym in the human dart in the human darm in the human oxiday.
They can be only oral oral with something that the monoamine of the monoamine of them.
The fascinating is that the bettable carbolines in the lide of the benod monoamine-bottoms are to activate the tryptamine activate of the tryptable. How can do this in a flora of 80,000 plants two morfological experienced species, combined species a biochemical variety of the parts are greater than the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the ements?
We're saying early trial and ror, and ror," which is becoming designed here.
The Indians saying, "The plants talk to us. What mean? That mean? That tribe, the Cofan, is 17 variants of ayhuasca, which they can identify all the big distance of against distance as one species.
If you ask their question how they were taxonomy they say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
Do you know completely do?" I said "no."
And it turns out to all the 17 types in a night at full moon in different shown in different shown.
You didn't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book than a piece of country count.
Well, the problem is that even the problem is even those sympaths under us that sympathy towards as a curious and seeing curious and seeds, but reduced to a foot in history as the real world in history as the real world.
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember to be reminded to the war or technological innovations, but earlier as the age, and active particips or passive particips of biological and cultural diversity of biological diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always part of a dance with new life.
Techtechnology is also the problem.
The Siously indians not Sious to be Siously, when they gavate their pile, just as the Americans Americans are stopped Americans Americans, when they gave their horse their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that the integrity of the integrity of threat. It's power.
The wred face of government.
What you're looking at the world, you'll notice that it's not going to figure out of these cultures and disappear.
These are dynamic living people, whose existed by identified by identifieable force of their adaptable.
Or this now is about the enormous deforestation of the Penan, a nomadih South Asian, a nomadio that until and with the last generation in the forest generation in the forest generation of the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers of Bornew look at the South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese South Chinis's South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese South Chinese South Ahinese South Aside Chinese Sustanese South Canese Southvarese South Canese Zouth Canese Zouth Apanese South A
to fill their ships of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that are dropping his inside as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetter to the Tibetter where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical exception, the physical exception, but the destruction of the destruction of life destruction of a people, not only not afford, but becomes in a lot of areas of part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not too contain, until you on the basic level.
I have a young colleague about a young colleague about country of China to Lhasa.
And when I started in Lhasa was in Lhasa that I understood the statistics where you heard about.
6,000 Hay monuments destroyed 1.2 million people had killed in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
Because of that he was killed directly when the Chinese invasion started.
His supported with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people.
His mother showed because she was wealth.
He became the prison of the prison when he was two -- and he was hidden under her rock, because she didn't without her.
And the sister that heldhaftly was stopped in a food camp.
On a day stepped per accident on an armband of Mao. For this over-year-old she's seven years.
And the pain of Tibet can be inheard, but the liberating of the people's mind of the people.
And finally, it comes down on a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of such life or want to live a colorful world of diversity world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she death that we focused that we've direction.
We wouldn't just see the human imagination become a smal, model thinking, but also forget to a smal, and forgottten that there are other opies.
We can feel us feel to the idea that our type of the idea that our species.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our far, where we gave our far, where we gave on the seeds, when the poetry replace of the shaman was replaced by specialization, and we shot a specialization, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years.
This surface history history gives me not the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world around the meaning of humans are asked by 10,000 different voices.
And it is in that song that we're going to discover again, to be discovered to be what we are, a folbest species, that everything that are in the work of all the gardens and can flower. There are big mess. There are big moments of optimism.
This photograph I've been on the northern of Baffin Island genomes, when I went on narrown.
This man, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always before the Intern. In the 1950s. In the 1950s. In the 1950s.
The opa of Olayuk.
The family weapons for his life and record him already weapons, all his tools.
Now you need to understand that the Insion of the coll; they made it use.
The gline became the slight of their sleets were made of fish in charibood.
Olayuts was not afraid for the poolnight or the storm.
He went outside, showed his business skin and pools in his hand. Ten the power started to freezing, shaped it as a well.
He brought a layer to the side of the mess.
When it solid was sleeping a dog.
He did the dog and improvised a hearnas.
From the ribbast, he made a sleet.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared, including pools.
Anything around with nothing around, and this, in many way, a lot of symbol for the resistance of the indigenous people in the world.
In april 199, the Canadian governmental government from a piece of country greater than California and Texcas Texcas it called California and Texcited Nunavut.
It's independent area. They are all the resources.
It's a amazing example of how a nation of how a native enough of how a native.
And finally, I think it's clearly, at least for whole, at least for who is requestion of the world, that she didn't get away from the world far.
They are somebody else land.
They standing the human imagine of the human imagination, which will go back to the begin of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, just as that of the one, part of a hope.
What we ended to do at National Geographic, is going from the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that a polem -- we think that a polemic, but we don't think that stories, but we probably believe that stories can change the world, which is probably the best changes in the world is best 35 million times a months a months a months a months a months a million publics a millions of public.
We're making a lot of traveling to the eat, with our audience, with our public cultural places, where the conceptional places, where the concerned by what he sees hopefully, so that hopefully, so that hopefully the most important public of the anthropology is going to be in a way to live in a multure, that we can find a way to live in a multural pluralistic world to live in a multural pluralist of pluralist of pluralist of pluralistic world,
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom can contribute to us be.
Thank you very much.
And I want to talk about a few question that I decided that I decided to a book
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain whatever it makes you may be misting.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly official dogma of all the West, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows: Because of our citizens on the highest level, we need to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human exist.
There's a freedom of freedom to act across active to act a higher prosperate, to reach a higher prosperately without of this.
The ultimate freedom we find choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically.
This is so deep in our society in our society.
And in our life in our life is crazy.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket.
Any about dressings.
Now, that 175 can-hundred dressings are in my supermarket, in my supermarket virgin my supermarkets.
And you can put the number of dressings, for the case, for the case between 175 types of you.
So that's the touch of my supermarket.
Look at electronics, you can look at electronics, you can imagine your stereoset player.
One that one electronics, you can pick out of this attacy.
And you can know, six-and-half million different systems, with subjects, with subjects.
Give to -- you have a lot of time.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young a young time ago, you could take all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You didn't have the state. You can't bought it out.
That had the advantage of the advantage that it has never been a piece of this.
That time.
Today, there are a lot of different variety.
And before with cell phones is the diversity.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mid-3--player and crer and crer and crer crer and crer and crush.
Well has not seen this model haven't seen this model in the store, but you can make sure that that that happens.
And the consequences, people come to the store and question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the point of stuff that are much more important.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States that you go to the doctor, and tells you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and saying, "We can do that, or we can do it.
As has this fairly and night.
So what do you want to do?" What are you doing?"
And you say, "Doctter, what does you?"
And the doctors says, "As has this front -- and doctors this front.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And then we call that the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact that the heavy of decision of decision of the decision of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor, somebody who are certainly and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient.
Because considered that ners, because the goal group, because the goal group, you can't buy it.
Why make advertising, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we are the next tomorrow our doctor to ask our doctors to ask that other brand medicine.
Our identity, right, yet a tract of aspect of us exist of choices, as you can see on this.
Our identity, our identity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want.
Everyone every morning, you have to think of what you want to be.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a whole though everybody anybody else that you can possible so quickly as quickly as quickly as fast as possible as fast as possible.
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you were doing.
Now, driving everything for the opportunity.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, which I developed less house work.
They're not dommber or the long time.
No, they've got the pressure with choices.
"Would I marry or not? Well, I now?
Or I will wait? Or do I first first children, or a career?"
These are the questions.
They're going to have an answer answer, if this means that it doesn't get all their homework, and therefore not a good number.
And they're right. It's important life.
And then we've been able to work. Carl gave to work. Carl gave that technology us to work every minute every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place, by the way, which I love secret out where WiFi it does.
I'm not true, because I don't want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that enormous choices of work whether we're going to whether we're going to whether we're going to work, whether we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a football of our son, with our son, with our sone, with our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop.
And even if they're all out of standing out of standing every minute, each minute with all kinds of questions, "Do I answer this?
Do I write on this email react? And I write this letter?"
And even if the answer, "Ne," we experience, we experienced the football of our son a very different way.
What we see we look at it, the large, the small, materialist bags, life is a question of lifestyle.
This is what the world was used to look like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And the world looks like.
The question is, Is this good?
The answer is: "Yes."
And we all know what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about is bad about it.
That enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects on human.
A very opposition effect is that the earlier earlier.
With so many choices, people find it difficult to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example from here, a research for investments in volunteers.
A colleaguard access to investment investment data from Vanguard, a big polishing society society with about one million employees about 2,000 vestigations.
And she discovered that for each 10 political fundary tremendously two percent nam.
At fives did 10 percent less employees less than five founds. Why?
Because it with fifth fundred is so difficult to choose that people just extend to the next day, and that are down to the next day, and so on.
And from outside comes down.
That means not only that those people after their pensioned after their pensioner because they didn't have enough money because they don't have enough money, but also that the choice knowledged that the choice.
That least 5,000 dollars a year for 5,000 dollars a year.
The worker was prepared to double their own contribution.
So a lot of choice can work together.
And I think the world through it looks like this.
If it government, if it government, you want to make the right time, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fund, or even the wrong fund, or even the wrong.
That is the first effect. The second effect is also that we did the paralyzed and eventually left less shaped and eventually less teves.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
One is that there is a choice, for example, for example of dressings, behind the choice was not perfect.
And you imagine in such a case for that another choice would better.
This was dreamed alternative alternatives that you get speak of your choice.
And does break on the entertainly of the choice that you have made, even if it was a good choice.
How more options there are, the easier to have more option, and easier to have been option.
A second reason of doing with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert of gave to how much we used the value of the value of things that we equivalue them.
If you can imagine a lot of alternatives, you can see the attract of all the alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives.
That makes you fewer less text with the alternative.
One example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example.
This imagine in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive.
They are beautiful beautifully beautiful again.
Don't do it? "Fordikic," thinks that man, "It's aughtor.
Everybody in my neighborhood in my neighborhood.
I could flat my car for the door.
And he's sitting there two weeks, with the idea that he's every day again.
Substitution costs are going to cost of our choice that we've got of our choice, even if we make a wonderful choice.
How more possibilities, the more attractive alternatives.
And those presenting to us as substitution.
Another example.
This pictures a number of points.
Like in here, and now for example, and now you have to consistence.
And one point is that you get to every choices.
And all that other has been so attractive cans, which is that the chose option becomes less attractive to attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this.
I always speak always brow.
Because it was only one kinds of speed broek, and that bought you. The page, it was incredibly incomfortable, but if you did the broek long enough, but if you did the broek long enough and often enough, felt it was OK.
And after years, I went to the store for a new one.
And I said, "Day, I want to get a speek, this is my make.
And the store said, "Do you figure fit, easy fit, easy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know or a rhy? Do you want to be a rhything, or acid-washed?
Do you have a lot of crazy effect?
Do you want to walk a little bit, or flink walking pion." And so he went down." And so he went down.
And I was talking about. And after a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want the only brother."
He had no idea what broke, and so I've got a long long all the possible broed.
And, actually, I left the store eventually eventually included passed brow.
I did better do. And I had better to do it better.
But I didn't get better.
Why? To explain my own, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all that choice freedom, was that I started to expect a good speek.
I started without any expectation, because I just known.
When it turns out there were different and one of that, and one of that would be able perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I mean, my break with my expectations, and that imagined me.
How more possibilities, people have more expectations about the deservices of that possibilities.
And that means people are less texts with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in really about it.
Everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was doing, people could have pretty experiences.
In our modern society of society as a citizens perfection, but the best thing we can reach, is that something that we can accomplished is so good if we had expected.
Never become surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectation.
The secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much to expect.
I want to imagine -- you know, a car biographic elemental -- that I'm married with a woman who really fantastic is.
I didn't have me with her satisfied.
But with less enough his good sides.
Anyway, you know, when you bad a bad bad bad of being a bad bad bad of being a bad fast, you can start wondering why you're inteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brows are available, and you buy against a bit turns out who is responsible than responsibility?
The answer is just simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different broken you don't have an excus.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions are good, they're picked about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations.
A factor -- not the engine, but a significant factor at this explosion of depression of depression of depression and self-myself experiences.
And if they're trying to explain, they're trying to explaining itself.
So the netoresulate is that we have objectively objectively, but our bad bad of govern.
Some of a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for everybody.
But that's not.
It's not a doubt that can choose better can't choose better than you can't choically automatically that's more choically better.
There's a magical borders of choices abilities. Well, I don't know.
But I know that we're already for a long time, that choice before us.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best thing that we can keep us.
The choice in industrialized countries comes out of material overfluences.
There are a lot of places on the world, we've heard about before, where the problem is not too much of the problem is not too much choice.
So the paradox I discussing here with the paradox I discussing West.
That is frustrating and all of this: Steve Levitt you yesterday and told to install that expensive kids don't help help. Solart of your money.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help it. Erger now.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all of these choices behaviors to countries that people are going to have a little bit of these people.
And our life would live forward.
That's what economists called a Pareto.
Everybody is better through revideo -- not only poor people -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choice that we pushed with us.
Anyway, this. If you read this. If you read this picture, people say, "Ah, what does say, "Ah, what does that fis?
Nothing is possible."
Some of an imagination, a shortly, global worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I started better understood that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on hand: If you put the fish to create possibilities, you don't have freedom, but paralyzing.
If you put the fish to create possibilities, you're less text less text.
It leads to more paralyzing and less teving.
Everybody needs a fishing sense.
This is a virtually certainly certainly -- even for the fish, but for us.
But the absence of a figured figured to ask is questions, really, really, inclucky.
Thank you for your attention.
