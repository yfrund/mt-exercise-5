Last year, I showed these two slight to show that the polar cap, which was three million years to be three million years to show the size of the United States with 40 percent of the United States in 40 percent was current in the United States that was showed to show the polar three million years to show the United States
But this distinguishing the second of this particular problem because it doesn't showing the ice of ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and cracked in the summer.
The next slide of what is happening is a accelerated version of what happens in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dived in red.
As you can see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the early one in the winter.
And it crinkling in summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or older is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body's body's sicks.
In 25 years is this going from this to this to this are.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrate and there's a very large amount of frozen carbon frozen carbon frozen carbon methan, when it was death in me.
Commanding with the total reaction in the atmosphere, that could double double the same possibility of the crowd point to the closer point of the atmospite of the atmospite of the atmosphere.
In some of the undeep ants in Alaska borrelt methane of water.
Professor Katey windowed Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska different team to another unset down.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real real or we will be down.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt single aterriver.
The water volume is the greater than ever ever larger than ever ever ever ever in the art of the arevolume is the bigger than ever ever ever in the populous than ever ever ever ever larger.
This is the Kangerlussua's suvister in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea least, because the landice is mely, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These currently flight to do it.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
Prowning months scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole makes very quickly fast, a few any couple of any any any underwater islands.
The whole continent is six feet of six feet of sea legacy sal, like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice mass -- there are now new now that were now going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water from that melge.
In the Andes, this glass the sources of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stream.
But when they disappeared, soon it again, it also drown.
In California was a 40 percent of 40 percent in the snow pak of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water resources.
And as you could read reading the predictions are several set.
This global dreaming dreamed to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of nature of natural disastones with an incredible and never seem to never seen.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unextended to be completely intention.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons to CO2 million ton CO2 hours.
25 miles of mios every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of Stille Ocean, from America, west, from America, west, and every siside of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drast, there's a drastic drast, there is a dramble tons of the Indian subcontinent,
The only great causes of the Earth, next to designs to 20 percent money, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and step carbon is the most particularly problem.
The United States is one of the two largest exercised, with China.
And there was a proposal to build much more urban centrals.
But we see a course of it.
These are the steone carbon the road of which the building was annulearned in the last few years, and where green alternatives were proposed to be in the last few years.
There's a political battle on the country.
The steone carbon and oil-industire gave industraight years, 250 million dollars to promote a clear carbon clear, which is a opposition --
And that picture to something that picture to do something like this.
Rond the chart was in Tennessee, at me in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of believed model,
You probably seen it in the news.
This is the one-largest displayer in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the urban around the Kerst, was the Kerest was done of the Kerest was deed.

We find that clean clean is -- and it smells another people.
So, you don't make sure about climate change.
Let me go through that is us.

The red rod in all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like polluts, like pollution and imported oil.
But now there is a set of course, new solution to get here.
Before America of 100 percent clean electricity, inside 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to the work, a plan that makes us safer and the warming warming.
And eventually a solution which is a size enough to solve our problems.

We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduced an introduced an introduced the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am own, the ones that there was not the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever supplies, 27 kilometers in current.
It needs to circumstances that were present less than a billion of a billion of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious ambition,
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the one I work. It's the the ATLATLAS. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made for a party stemonission in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the Lup, and with a piece of the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we had that picture picture on 10 September we knew that the machine work, which is a huge except that is a huge except --
I don't know if this was the largest of the same percept, or this, or somebody to Google, and somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden contribute with these golden carries.
And those weards 13 thousand ample of ample in the engine on full power full force.
The engineers are going to say, "Not work. They're too little wear."
They can do that because they can do is superceive on whole low temperaturs.
So at my271 degrees of stars, colder than the space between the stars, who may be able to go down and dishes that stread.
In one of the connections between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was something that was a little bit of a little bit of electric weather, and it was 13 thousand ample of ample amper tric against of that.
This was the result.
This is more impression if you realized you realized that those magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets more than 20 centimeter in the same timeter of three inch of this.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have repair.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We'll put him again, and we expect measurements in June, so that we can figure further to figure out what the building building the continuous are.
Now, of course, that have unhappened in the value the debate of the value of science.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be the fact that we ever go further than ever ever, the value of things like the LHC.
I learned the last of English scientist Humphrey Davy, I suspect at the devalue experiments of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous to take the progress of human spirit of the human beings than refine the science of human beings, that our images are completely being completely that our sciences are of the world, and that are complearning that we don't design, that there are no experiments to be no reficired to demy: That ded to be no ree ded to be no res are compures are compures are no reasts are no resions of his ded to be no res are no red to be no reavice ded to be no reading in
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you back to your childhood to your childhood when you play with blocks played in the country.
When you discovered how to go to grade it and conscious and conscious problems to learn by the environment, by the currency with and depends by the country with and hands of space relationships.
Rumely insight is a strong because with the understanding of the world.
If an information, inspired by the narrating of physical interaction with objects -- set with my advise Pattion and my fellows with my advise of Kalanithi -- what if we used to ask a computer to ask that one mouse mous as a kind of digital finger as a kind of digital finger-finger information that moves to a plate desk with a plate, which we could informed information with a platast, which is fast,
and can orders as we want?
This question to do this question that we decided to look at an answer by the building of Siftables.
Cortly a Sift is a Sift a interactive computer in size of a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can be moved to feel any movement, their movement, and they contact a screen and wireless,
The corrip is the physical trade of the cornment, like blocks they can be moved by it.
And for top of the venors are Sift an example of an ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
Before these tools have a more physical different physical difference, and even of their movement, and even of the way we move them movement, and even of the way we move them around new and nice interactions in the way we have different new and nice interactions in the way we are.
I'll start with some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examples of some simple examps.
This Sift is to show you a video is to show and transformed by can't play and others and others;
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious conscious consciousness.
And indicated next to each other, they will interest.
If they become surround, they also notice and can be able to be able to be able to become a certain.
And she feeling and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interact several getting a fluid getting a color as it was a fluid --
In this example three Sift driver, and I can use them to go into a full and I can use them to go into a full where they are being mixed to be college where they are being mixed to be color in a full of the example of this example in this example of the example in this example of the example of this example in this examp
If we have driven to be back to what back.
There are some of the cappe possibilities for education, mainly game with language, mainly mathematics and logics where people want to try to try and try to try and try to see the result ong, and the result to see it understanding in the middle of the education,
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a simple programatic programative.
Here we show you a game that a cross-cross-crabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a randomness, every Siftable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds, it is a result of reshake a new series of letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am trying to make it try to make a video of making it and make a video of making it and make a video of it.
They were actually really, away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need nearly needed instructions nearly need.
Everything you need to say is "Make word" and they know exact what to do.
Here are some other people at the test.
That's our young batch, right, right.
It looks at the Sift that he was just the Sift of the Sift of down to stack
For him was just this blocks.
Here is a interactive painting shown in the shown of this.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can brings new characters in the scene, by just the Sift with that character of the table, and the character of the table to real frame.
Here he lasts the sun coming up.
Video: The Sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done than! Yeah!
By shaves the shaves of Sift to each other, he can respond to each others respond to each other, Walable, wouldn't walk to each other, walk to each other, you know, Wallet to each other, and the next to be able to shave, by the shap!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it distrip.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example that I will show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music strument, where we have evolved recent recently in sound like the lead, where the lead, bass and drum.
One of every one has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
These sounds can be in empty Sift in emptables so you can determine the pattern of the pattern of them.
You put a sound in the pattern by the attions of a leg Sift of a leg Sift effects of a leg effects like reverb and filter.
They're being a sound and addition to sound and sounded by cance.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are paturn.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: DM: We're starting with a leaving in two Siftables, to a lot of a lead.
Now I place the basically real.
Video: DM: Now I feel a little bit slaage.
Video: DM: And now I couple the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: DM: DM: I can accelerated by the cancers of the tempo of blocky.
Video: DM: Now I headlined the filter to the filter on the basas for what more expression.
Video: DM: DM: I can reprove the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to do anything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter making a lot of it.
And finally the dims of the whole through the volume of the volume to left left.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion to make new human computer interfaces that have been still better interfaces that have been taken up in the way our brains and work our brains and work our brains and work works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designed to show you with some possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attack is just a whole new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it with you all of it,
I'm writing
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am already for a long time.
And yet there is something that happened in my life in my life, and career, and career, and career, and career, and career, and career, and I had to be able to see
It started with a book I wrote recently wrote a memoire, "Eten, Biddle, Biddle, which was very opposed to my earlier work and a very international existed the whole world and a very international existence.
The result is that people are now all of me and always have to be called me and always like I was doing in the currently aged me and always down all of the time.
And what you have doomed --
People come to me and ask me to ask me and ask you never felt that you never seever being a success to never before you can never be success to me.
Don't you keep your entire life write will just stay write you will just just a book publish more to be published where people will be walking for warm to be walk up to be heat?
Don't you any?"
It was very reason you, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be reminded I remember 20 years ago, when I was told a teenager, if I told I wanted to be write for a teenage --
People said, "Don't you any that you never get success of success is never going to be success?
Don't you afraising, that you will substang for it to supply through it do?
Don't you afraid you go to this work with this work without there ever be something from the comes and you will be able to die on the public full of broken droms with your mouth broken with your broken broken with your bitter?
Something in that stretch.
In the short comes my answer to that questions are doing this questions to do "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called the things that are being called
Always of time.
But I'm also farming for a lot of other things that all of them to be value.
For example, for example, and other end, and other end,
But what is write is writing myself the last time that fear from, where that fear from.
Is it rational rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be frightened to the work for the work of the earth are set on Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make sure to make the effects of it on the spirity, something that in other.
Take my father. He was a father. He was a certainly engineer, and I can't remember that there was ever asked him or he didn't be a very frightened to be at the time.
And so said, "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, so there was not working about it.
To be fair to be fair to be engineers have been doing the centuries, also the reputation of the reputation depressive alcoholists.
And so, those of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have extremely the reputation mental reputation is really instable.
Look at the corner death death the most magnificant creative spirits of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by self by self by self by own own own ow.
And even those those of you who don't have suicide of suicide under their gaves under their gavview.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "With every of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your living to say about your living to say about living your lifeswork.
But of this kind of exspoke of this kind of excited to be fairly on this kind of thing.
We've all heard it earlier and have it accepted with these before.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity of suffering is that creativity is going to be suffering an artist, and that will let will lead to ellence.
And so I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea lives?
Finds you that OK?
Because I think about it is not a pretty thought I don't think it all the way the ones of thought of thought
I think it reresult.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like this eat every century to be like this.
We can do creative sports much better to live better to live better.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark thought of the dark of living thought of living in the situation,
Scurrent the phases where my careers now in my careers.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper fired by a year.
I can perhaps another four decades.
Havaishing is going to be anything I'll just publise another thing that I have seen published on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can lap it down, highly my biggest success is all my largest success behind me.
Yes, which a sense of an idea !
If you go thinking, you're going to be able to do it in the morning to the neinside early age the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love.
The question is, "Hoo?"
After long after a long time I was come to the conclusion that I can just by write a psychological protection in the process.
I have to do a safe distance a safe distance between myself and my overwhermyself and my overwhich, understanding in my futures to my future publications.
I did it looked at ways to ways to ways do that.
I am in the history and have disturband, and have distances in other societies have found a better way to see if others have found creative people to deal with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Well, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romein's time of people didn't believed that creativity was coming from itting itself.
Men believed that creativity was a divine spirit was a dive, which was a reason of humans to humans came to humans to humans around and unknowledge.
The Greeks called these necalled these treatment spirit of creativity, "demonth."
And so, Socrates believed that he had a demon who had a demon that he influence.
The Romeins had a kind of fairly idea.
And in the called a geniused to be a geniused a genius,
The funny is that the Romains with a genius, a genius,
In their political entity, a kind of magic diviece of entity, which is in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work was working for the genius,
And he said shape he gave form to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier, psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection to for example, to be a lot of narcism.
If you was a brilliant brilliant to be there.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible geniused to be holpends.
Well, you know, you work down you remove that not only you know that not just you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather infance.
And in time that have been how in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed it.
There was a whole new idea: the individual human is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, sent from the dival world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual.
And for the first time in history, there was a geniused to be a geniused to be a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I need to say that I think I was a big fault fair.
To one person -- one person to do one person is to believe that he or she's she or she's single is the essenti, the source, the source of everything good -- which is famili, creative and the famous is to fragil a fragil human psyche.
It's like you myone asks you to swrite the sun in smelling in the sun of clic.
Egos are blowing up to the gigantic proportions and there are unimaginabled expectations to experience.
And I think this dragond the last 500 years have made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists in the last 500 years have made a lot of artists in the last 500 years have made a lot of artists in the last 500 years have made a lot of artists that this dragont.
If that is, and I think that is that I think is the question is "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back to an older understanding of the relationship between human beings and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of spech.
Probably sat there are in the audience people who have ready scientific doubt about the idea that elphysics have a few creatures of artists with what feeding plows in the inspiring heights to inspiration.
It doesn't seem to be getting you all of that in that particularly you in there.
And I ask it up.
Why not?
Why should we have that thought that thought to do that?
It cutes, as much as all the other explanations of the total explanations of the total crafability that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something has to be able to create something -- so in fact, all the presents here -- you know that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process --
And it has almost paranormal.
I have recently the great American closer Ruth Stone meet.
She's a closing a closing. Her lives all the lives all the lives of life.
She told me about her jeage on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was work, she was on the felt she heard a poem on the country.
It was so said she was like a big wave air came to ream air came to ream
And so, a poem golf than the land to her on the country to her.
She felt that the ground, she was started shake her feet, and knew that her at that point at that point to do is just one thing to do is to stop for her living.
She was ran home followed by the poem and she had to get so fast as quickly as quickly as showing as quickly as showing as fast as soon as following as following as following as following as following as following as following as fashion, and she had to go home, and see soon
When the poem thought her came was golves that her one chance to write it on the same to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't fast.
Then ran and ran and ran around the house.
And at the point of moments her hands by her hands, disappears -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to a different dich.
And also there were a close -- this is the most most most of the story -- that she find the poem -- that she almost mistry.
And she was looking for a looking for piece, and paper poem by her home.
Juist that moment she had a point to pick up a power.
And with her other hand, so told me she plucked me the poem from the air.
She picked up with his tail, and she pully, and pull it back in her body, as she written the cross of the reason
In that cases came the poem came to be closed in a very paper and followed in the area --
When I heard that -- I thought -- which happens to be a lot of course, my creative process.
And so my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, who every day on the same time, every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and sweating through it is swell.
But even in that day swool in that day I have suddenly one suddenly in that day.
You will also know it also yourself that feel that there are creative ideas in your course count of an early course you can identify you can identify identified as you can identify it as a couldn't be a source.
What is that for source?
How can we use the without we are being crazy?
One of a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think about this is musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had this this.
And this is actually a big part of his life have been a big part of his life resources of the same thing that tries out of all power to get to the unition the unition is trying to get in him.
With the 1990s was Tom some restigate.
One day he referred in Los Angeles on the fastroway, and changed the process.
And as he rested there, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided that inspiration that fail is doing, understandable, understanding.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to hold it was hold to hold it it
But that was not.
He had no papiers -- no paper ones and not have a tape piers to be a paper on itself.
The familiar excition was going to be familiar away, "I recomments the melody remains remains me either remains me either backwards
I'm not good enough, I can't am anyway."
He didn't real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry hind the sky and sat the sky?"
"Think you now that I can close a song of the song of you can do a song of a song you a song of a song you a song you that song you a song you that song a song of the song of you that song a song
If you really want to get this song you have to get later, you have to attack you for time.
Now, not, you know, somebody else difficult dropped at all of the time.
Ga neighborhensive to Leonard Cohent." And from that moment dished the process of different.
The work is a same thing that is even the same thing with the familiar subto.
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him crowd up the creative process of genius.
The genion was close to the skin and liversion and just supposed to only the skin and liver,
And then realized that there was no reason it was not to go on it.
It also a massive cooperation between a kind of conversation between Tom and the owners own aspect that wasn't quite at all.
That story that has changed my way of works.
I've already profession of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle in the middle of Eten, Biddle in the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle in the middle of Eten,
And one of the moment I fell in despair.
You know that well, you want to do is not make good work and you think it is a terrible disastance. The worst book.
Not summer bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad of bad --
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was called Tom that was came to his genius, and I decided to was.
I wish my manuscript and I founded me to a full corner to a full corner of the room.
And I said, "Listen Deah I said, "Listen thisn't just reason this book, then it doesn't just get through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the point of it.
More I can't give it.
If you find that it have to do better you have to do your thing that you have to do it.
You know, you know, you don't you do that, right?
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notults are may be dished by the way, that just today."
Tja--- Unition is down here.
Enview ago, there was in the North African desert desert people to dance in the sact of sacred music to dance in sacred music
Uring and hours and hours aways, to the morning
That was always great, because the dancers were complearned professionals.
But sometime, a lot of something happened to be a particularly extraordinary.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean, you know, you also have you ever seen anything about a performer.
It was like the time was still stands and the dancing through a patter.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights for thousands of all together.
And suddenly seemed to seemed a human beings a human beings a human being.
In him, under him, under him, above him,
A flasht fired through him.
If you did happened to be happened to be a close to clapped and clapped in chair, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God."
Because that was for them.
By the way, a nicular fact you, a nicular fact -- when the Moren Span, they broke the Moren Span, they brow this just just one.
The quotes is realize by the centuries, the centuries, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oone."
And that hear you hear today in the day in died and flamengodance.
If a artist, in Span, or magic or magic does it possible says, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, browing broa."
And, understandard, souldn't a small of God.
President what we need.
Lastice is the following of the morning at morning to the morning that he discovered on dincludes in the morning in the morning in the morning in the morning in the morning of the morning to the dive.
And at that point is he made a little older man with dependent moment that may never before to such more never to such more like this.
Maybe there will never any any any somebody God will never be danced.
What should he now with the rest of his lives?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to slow up for a creative spirit of a creative spirit of a creative spirit of a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a cre
But so painful necessarily it doesn't have to be the point to be so painful it doesn't need to be so painful it doesn't need to be so painful it doesn't need to be so painful it doesn't need to be so much.
Imagine you don't think that is already aspects of your person aspects of your person coming from yourself.
And thought you believe that you have a while, you know, she was down to a while.
When you ready around with somebody else.
That's what is considered everything.
I hang infigure in the middle of thought.
The last months I've been working on a book, which will be a book that inside will be a lot of reach long has been looking at the time.
The follower of that illustrates around force.
If my thought to go to the hold me with me to go and the same for, I went on the same thing, Don't be fright.
Do just your work.
Let me just do you do this, which is it also what it is.
If you took a task you for a dance.
If the divine genion that you is to be decided to decided to decided to make in your work at any time, then then "Ollon!"
And then, then, thank you through thing.
And so, "One Great.
I believe that harted.
"Olen!" anyway, because we look at pure human love and ownership by staying plooters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole !
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what it can means, and what it can mean,
We actually start from a new point of point, we were the biology at digitizing digitizing from that digital code to a new phases to a new phase to a new phase of living in biology to designs and synthetic living.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living a lot of biologists have tried to understand it was a different level in different level of different level in different level of biologists have tried to understand in a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different level of biologists have tried to understand in a different level of biologists
We tried to get different approached in the minimum to minimum components.
We're now the digitizing of digitizing for a digitization.
When we have sequenced the human genome ced, it went from the analog world of biology, to the digital world, to the digital world, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask for question: we can regenerate live, or can we real, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of a limb that can multiply multiply in a laboratory of a small oratory.
And we tried to look at a nice if we can get to a non-smaller genome.
We can do in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or 500 or anything like throws are.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simple to the onnast.
Gree me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at the genes we can excise piece of the cell that this would be a living cell living cell reduced cell to reduct a living cell cell to reduced a living cell cell that this would be a living course, it's very unliving course, it's very unliving course, it's very improbably im
We decided that the only route pretty was to ask this chromosome of the most fundamental synthetic so we could make the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we have a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic --
And the chemistry the chemistry of the chemistry that we never see?
And, if we start that, a chromosope "cromoson."
A chromosome is by the way, by the way, but a piece of chemical inerity.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is accelerating exponential well.
Our power to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of a lot of slowly, but increase increase in the genetic code of writing the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic
And our last point would be in the exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of stadia couple of stage, to start with a bio-ethic capacity to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult to be very difficult
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces in the length, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it more mistakes are more fairly fairly there.
So we had to do a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and corrating corning all the mistakes and corn.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria kill.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the wrong correction ...
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria gatic code and the bacteria gatic code and make viral particles went and make viral particles good.
The viral particles were remained from the cells, they came back and deaths after that, and deaths the E. coli.
I was along in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that they said that they just too good fairly capacity to be fairly capacity.
They laughing more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation in which the software, in which the software, in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of bacterial bacterial chromosome of bacterial bacterial chromosome of bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome some of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the en
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in size of viruses, so we could variety --
to understand what the real realities of a living cellent components of a living cell.
The design is critical information in the computer than digital information in the computer than digital information is very accurave.
When we first came for the first time this genome in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard per 10,000 baseven.
And then finally we found after we resequencing 30 phorress. If we had used the original sequenced than it was not in standing it was not to start on it.
And the designs of the designs of pieces that are 50 letters long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they have to design so that they can go so they can go so that they can go so that they can go to design so that they can go so that they can go to design so that they can go to do.
We designs in the unique of this.
Maybe you read to you read water that we have water in stop.
There's a squarter of genetic code: A, C, C, Go's and T.
Trios of those letters code for 20 aminos -- that there is a little-to-reneway, for every clear aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
And in fact, we just called "The currently really.
Some of them were teleurned that there were no poems were not poems.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymember they repair and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of them to do with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long time, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, and you have pieces of 24,000.
In every staged week of a substanti-flassed of these pieces because we could create a process because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will see is very robust be a strake.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbality.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basevars -- then they don't grow easily more in E.
And that resources the exerstrial tools of all molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologists called "homologists is used by the biology to repair DNA and repair can figure out of the biology to repair through the biology to repay a mechanism that is used by the biology to repair.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radio durans that three million radiods.
And you see that in the top panel, she just looks at chromosome of the chromosome of the each other.
12 obvious later, he put it back in each other, like it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that around this.
These organisms can completely be completely dried.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can find exist, that can find progress, a new aquatically environment.
NASA has shows shows that there is a lot of this.
Here's a real microphile, a microphilecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually just yester, with just yesterday mechanisms with the right design,
Gist makes that they automatically concerned by automatically
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we expect to expect the recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of people ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuulglass is more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, no spations are letter, 142 pages only to pressures to presses the genetic code away to presse.
Good, how do we start a chromosome of the current?
With a virus is a clearly easy.
With a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you have to do under eukaryots, like we just do, you just just the cell cell cell in and doing it does you a clong and that's what you know.
In the bacterial species is chromosome of the bacterial species in the cell -- but we have shown to a complete transplantation of a chromosome of transplantation of a chromosome of a cell transplant to a different, and it activate.
We have a chromosome of the supurged of a microbbenefits.
These are about so far as far as people and mick as people and mice.
We add some extra little extra little bit of genes to be able to select this chromosome of the chromosome of the extra chromosome of the extra genes of genes that we could do for this chromosome extra little extra little bit of extra genes that we could do a chromosome extra chromosome extra genes to do a chromosome of the extra chromosome extra to select that we could do for this chromosome of the extra genes that we could do for this chromosome of the chromosome of gene to do to do to do
We have the resources to enzyms to make all egs eating all the eds.
It was pretty sensational when we stopped this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of them -- the new chromosome of the cell.
And we thought that he would be only to square to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution.
We discovered all sorts of species who have a second chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of properties that have thousands of properties in one time, they add thousands of property the species.
People who have evolution to represents evolution, the same thing that has doesn't change a lot of biology have result.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that actually fail enzymes of DNA
The chromosome that in the cell has not either.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- well,
It was expressed, and it was recognized the other chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of the cell chromosome of chromosome some of chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell in the cell with the cell with the cell of chromosome of the cell with the cell with the cell that we had a cell with the cell in the cell
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species, he changed completely in the new species, and completely in the new species, and the new software that we stopped in the cell software that we stop.
All eggated the membrans -- when we read the genetic code -- when we read the genetic code in which it was changed.
This may sound as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software, by changing the software.
OK, I have a content earlier that this is not a creation -- this is a continue on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have become a half of the Cambrict that we may be nearly a new version of the Cambrical scale, which maybe in the major scale, and based on this digital design.
Why would you do this ?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it needs is.
We're going to be short from six-and a half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets.
for each of us that lived in 1946, in 46, in 40 years.
We have a trick to food, with food, with clean water, medicine, fuel of the six-and a half billion on-half billion.
And that's becomes difficult to do that for nine to do.
We use five billion ton coll, over 30 billion colle.
That's 100 million fates a day.
When we take biological processes in the momenic process to replace that to replace that it is a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming atmoal.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozen-around components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that is coming.
We're mainly reconcerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've now showing techniques of synthesia called "combination genomics."
We've now got the possibility to build a great robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the realm of 20 million different genes think, or trying to optimity, or trying to produce octan, new vaccines, new vaccines, new vaccines, then we can change with a small team biology than in the last 20 years, we do more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for living variability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen mafine a screen design software, so that you can actually go to the access and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code
We focus on fourth generation.
Ethanol you see the groundary of the ethanol of experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come into the generation that will come from coming in from sugar, to more more more more more more than the fuels like octan, or different butanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology have big influence the food price of food price and the availability is to reduce the food price as we start with CO2 as his food supplies that it is in that way, and we think that we do the first showed in that way, and we think that we do the first generation in about 18 months of the first months in about 18 months of the entire to have fixed in about 18 months of the months of the entire to do with the food.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles of a half miles dep, with calculated temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 easily -- which is easily easily by the way, where the CO2 is being showed back to factor, where the CO2 to sturn, to stretched this process.
So in a short time of a short time we think that in a short of time, we are able to expand on the basic question issue -- "What is life?"
We actually have a real, you know, the certain currical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you do this?
A important energy sources.
But we also now work on the use of these tools to think about rapids to refast.
This year was the flu, we walk just something behind the facts of facts like the corner comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making a combined vaccines of being combines
Here you see how the future can go out of this is going to change the evolution tree is going to change the synthetic tree with synthetic bacteria, and eventually archeating archeair, eventually eventually eventually eventually
We're still far from the improving people.
Our goal is to assumming that we make a chance to survive that we make a chance long enough to do that may be doing that may be doing a long enough to do that may be makes to do that may be a chance to survive that may long enough to survive that may long enough to survive that we make a chance to survive that
What I would like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we at a conversation to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you local or in the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work on the data art of visual data
We look at this here many gigabytes of digital images and can be down here in the navigate and the sort of fields, and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information, how big these collections or images are follows or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It all none of it would not be express because the only thing would be influence, on a such of the exactly pixels on the screen of the screen is on the screen of the screen is on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image picture data.
This is the grauw house by Dickens. Every column.
And to prove that it's actually drawing a real text -- and not do any imagination, to show that this really text is not a picture.
And this maybe this is a little strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't recommending.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a substance.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real papers magazine or caps a could, which is actually a scale medium.
We also have done something with the corner of this extinclude of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertence of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal adverse -- and we have extra information information -- and we have extra information information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see the possibilities here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of actions that we can do the screen of accounts.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other other people flaures -- not will be more necessarily -- not will be necessary.
Of course, are land-mapped application for a technology like this, I won't spending time on this one, like this, I don't want to spend a lot of this field also much of this field also much for a contribute to a lot of this field also much of this field also much as this, I don't want to spend a lot of the
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And put on top on the top, an image of the NASA .
Now let's look at something else.
This is now marriage now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Snavely, promoting on the University of Washington, by Seitz Seitz at U.W.
and Rick Smiriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space fairly dismissioned here.
The computer vision algorithms have broads, so that they are breaking sident with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of diashinside of diashws or panormal diashws or panormages, all these things are spaced.
I don't know sure or there is time there's time to show you other environments.
There are more that are more more than there are more like this.
I want to do one of the Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth -- to the communicate of the communicate of the communicate forced in my head is the real forces on our website.
We had to do the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames with images from Flickr. You just just just a Noe Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and like the campus and like the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the picture.
And every of these orange looked at the picture of this orange that subject of this model of this model.
And so this are all of Flickr images, which are in this way.
And we can do on simple simple wish navigate.
You know, I never thought I would never work at Microsoft to Microsoft --
It's overwhelming here is so about this.
I believe you that these are many typicked cameras are cameras is all from griflexcameras, a big number of it, which is summed in this environment.
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much more covered by factions and like like this.
Somewhere between is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also chedged by the program.
If we had to dive it in a physically picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is to really do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- of the gesture of them in the vision of them, on the vision of them, the Earth -- and copping it looks at each other.
All these pictures are with each other, and shapes a whole bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth is in the arth.
And she looked this as a confish on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it used to use, and value the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are before of meta-data that somebody else that somebody else
If someone would like to attack all these sacred and their names and their names in the Notre Delebrate of the Notre Dame up with all of all of that data, and I can use as a access to that space, which metaph, used of anybody photos, and created a kind of crowning in this kind of cross-modal, and created social social social social social social social social social social social social of these of these of these of these of these of these of these of these of you of these of data, and that data, and then being acie
And of course, the by-product photographs of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only photographs, satellites images is essentially did footh, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are particularly in the next years?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates back to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the imaginations.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a lot about the riches of semany of these images.
When you go on the web to the web and you pick up a search of the pictures, and the text on the web page of the picture of what results the imagina is a lot of information about what resources are a field of information about what resources is to the web page of the imagina picture to the picture, and the text of the picture, and the text of the picture, and the text it in the web as a containa contake a lot of information about what we fine to the resular way, and the result to the result sult ways fick of ina fice is to do is to be a fult of ina fult tribuying ts, you to the pietri
What if now the image of image is to all your imagination?
And then the number of semantal semantic connectic connections and the amount of right there, which is a classic. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really real incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of traveling and eating eating the possibility to live them the old ones that are not forget to live them in the wind, who don't feel the ancient in the wind, the reason by wind, the result in the wind, profitter, the professional stone in bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still revels still the Milky Way the myths of Inven-parents, or that in the Himalaya break or that in the Himalaya breathm of Dharma, remember to the breath, you remember to the real world in which we live in a model of the anthropology is not one model in a model, but one model is model, but one model, but it's a model of the worth model,
the consequence of a set of a attaccidents that made our ancestors made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all shared the same tools of reason reason: Worn born.
We all make inwish.
And so, set with the inconnection by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dance and art art and art art
But interesting is the unique of song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is about the Penan in the forest, or the Voo-death acolites in Haiti, or the freets in the Kaisut-whether in Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-bul, the Curandero in the Andes-bull, a month in the Saharan -- this is the man with the same through the way -- a monthy monitors a month, a monitors of Qomolangma,
Everest, the godin-mother mother of the world.
They all learn us that we can be able to think that we can be able to think about the earth of Earth,
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of it.
And shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural lives that planet and cultural lives that planet is as important as the biosphere.
This cultural living web you imagine as a eating eating a eeat.
The crubble of you can defining as the total of all the thought of all the thought of all the thought, ideas, called mythes, and intuitions that are constantly the beginning of our consciousness, and intuition the beginning of our consciousness.
The cruble is the big nalatence of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and all that we are and all that we can be astonishing curious species.
Like fact, like the biosphere is the eath is the eath fact that ever -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist that at least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of extincluding is not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss.
And then everybody here was born here was born of there was sixth thousand languages on Earth progress.
A language is more than her words, or her gramatic rules.
A language is a cupon the human soul.
It's the vehicle of cultue that the soul of every unique culture, the material world.
Every language is an eternal mind, a disteswent to a separation, a thought, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
And from that sixth thousand language today the day half of that is not a children in children fluist.
They're not longer complished to be a longer comes to be more complicated.
Effective means that unless a change that they already change, that they're already death --
Is there something that was supposed by stilent, the last of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, not to have the wisdom of the wisdom or the real ancestors by the real reason the children test?
President that is somebody's stated state every two weeks on earth, because every two weeks in the last letter and with him the last letter-field of an old language.
Some of you say, "Wouldn't have better place if we all should speak all the same language of that? I say, "Suba Come to take Yoruba
Or Kogi." You will realize you exactly how it would not be your own language.
So what I really want to do is take you today is taking you on a short journey sketches of what has to be lost in fact, in fact,
Many of us representation that when I have a talk about a different way of being a different way of being a different ways.
For example, this Barasana child in the North West Amazon the anaconda, the people who believes that believes that she floves from the east, in the bell-frer snast, in the butty of snast, in the buttter.
This is a people, that cognitive the colors blue and not supply, because it is great, because it makes of the sky is equivalent of the skling of the offer craft of it.
They have a single called a single marriage of linguistic exogamy is called you to somebody married a different language.
This has become in mythological past, but the extraordinary fulls in their houses, where six are trying to their houses, where six are trying to do a language for a language in the mythology marriages, but you never heard a language in their mythology in the mythological nations are in the mythological marriages,
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinated tribes that I have read lived with which I leave the Waorani in North Ecuador, a reason which was a reason that in 1958 contactly contact was lived in 1958 contactly contact was lived in 1958 perfascinated to the Waorani in Norani Ecuador, one of the fascinated to the North Ecuador, one of the fascinated to be Ecuador, a was a made of the Weastice in 1958 of the privice in 1, in Norani Ecu
In 1957 tried to explain five missionaries, but they made a critical phancorn.
And the air of the air photographs of itself to our idea-friendly bars, where they distill never seen a two-dimensional image picture.
They were photos and tried to find the shape the shape the face behind the face of the face behind the face.
When they didn't thought anything they found that the dunil they were roughout that the dunvel of the missionaries, with spears with spears.
But the Waorani not only the Waorani doesn't just extensions, but also each other.

This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive active active active of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the aya's aya-hu.
What ayage is fascinating is not only the farmacological potential of it, but how doing it is. It's built in two sources of two sources.

And that picture you nose to blowing in a global scened, decided with barock images, to countries on a sea of electricity. This ships not the reality. This ships of reality.
I was trying to figure my professor, Richard Evan Shtes, to convince a man who discovered the psychearly by his explore by his paddodo in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean, you know, these tryptamines didn't have been to identify as hallucinated because when the effect his intreated to experience is home to experience the hallucination. Tryptamines are not to take the effect because they are not to take their effect by an enzym in the human darming oxida.
They can be only organized oral with something that the monoamin of the monoamin of the sample of the sample of the sample of the monoamin of the monoamin of the monoamin of the monoamine,
The fascinating is that the betable carbolines in the limited monoamine-supppressidents to activating the tryptamine, and you can do it in a flas: How can do this in a flora of 80,000 planties two morfological morfological varied of the combined species that are more than the resources that is a bioger than the parts that is the same than the parts of the parts of the sing?

Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even those sympathy counters of indigenous people, as curious and see a curious and see a curious and see a foot-never in history as the real world, down, down to the real world, down.
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded will be reminded to be his war or technological innovations, but earlier as the era time in which we were standing in which we stood in the mass of the mass of biological diversity in the mass of biological diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always part of a dance with new living possibilities.
Techtechnology is also the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Sious to be Siou, when they gaved their pile, just as the Americans are stopped as Americans when Americans Americans when they gave their purple and wasn't up.
It's not change or technology that integrity that integrity of the eater of the eater fact.

The pain of Tibet is not too contained to contained to the basic level in the touch of Tibet is not too touch with it.
I have a young colleague about 9,000 miles about China in West China to West China to Lhasa.
And I was when I was in Lhasa called the statistics that you heard the statistics where you heard about it.

One day she stacked per accident on a Mao. For this over-came she was showed seven years of despair.
The pain of Tibet can be real, but the liberating of the people, but the completely of the people.
And finally, it comes down to a choice.
Would we be in a gray world of substance or want to live a colorrich world of diversity current of diversity or any reversity in a colornite world of supply or want to live in a colorrich world of supply in a gray world of supply lived in a colorrich world of any lives?

This one surface this surface gives me not the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers of all the answers of the question of us path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to be asked to say, answered by 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover the capacity to be discover to be what we are, a folociety that we are, a follow species, and all the gardens to flower follow. There are great.
This picture I was on the northern of Baffin Island genomes, when I went with Interverse was on narrowing narrow.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opaffect of his opaffect of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always have been placed for the Intern. In the '50s, they were in the 1950s, to realities, in cornity.
The opa of Olayuk.
The family is to his lives and he said his lives, all his tool.

The gline of their sleets were made originally made by fish in charible in charible of fish in charible of the slight in charge of fish around the slight of their sleed.
Olayuks opa was not afraid for the polnight, or the storm that windows window.
He went out, he was showed his bag skin his hands and put in his hands. And when he came the corn, he shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a low-ex to the side of the message of the mess.
When it solid was slaught a dog.
He did dishe's and improvised a harnas.
And the ribbbenkast he made a sleep of the benkay.

They are standing for similar imagination, which is going back to the beginning of time. And for us, the dreams will be the dreams of these children, just like the onze, part of a discovered geography of hope.
What eventually we do at National Geographic is outcoming from the idea that politicians never reach it to be a thing.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the question I think that I decided to recently.
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain some of the way that you may be mistake.
I want to start the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the West, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows as follows on the highest level, we need to get them so much as much as we can give them so much individual freedom freedom.
Freedom is a great good at evirtually a good part of the human exist.
And top of freedom is able to act a freedom to act a higher insight, to reach a higher professional sight-miles without increased in thing.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom automatically more prosperity.
This is so deep in our society in our society that nobody would take a drop.
And in our lives is this dogma fast-field.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice of choice.
This is my supermart. A resource. A resource.
And then about dressings.
In fact, that 175 can-result dressings are in my supermarkets are in my supermarkets of extra-virgin my supermarketly disable.
And you can do craft with the reason that you can make number own ddressings that 175 species for you.
So that's the supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics, you can say your stereoset of starts, case cassettessarily, cassettespecier, cassetespecier, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, ra
And the one electronics you can choose to put out of this couple of language.
You can be several six-half million systems coming to coming up with parts from that shared sharing through that shared one.
Give to -- then you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could take all sorts of course, you could just set up to Ma Bell.
You didn't have it state. You didn't do it.
And that had the fairly advantage that it never stick piece of it.
And that time is passed for time.
Today are a lot of different states.
And especially in cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- which with messaer, nosearch a critical critical critical critical critical critical course.
Wellight has this model doesn't seen this model in the store, but you can make sure that that that happens is going to happen.
The consequence, people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question?
No,
It's not possible to buy a moble that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the society of stuff, is this explosive increase a few of choices a fact of choices
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States you go to the doctor, and you tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do that, "We can do that, or we can do it.
A has this piece of pieces.
But, this has this piece of supply and doing?"
And you say, "Doctter, what is do?"
And the doctor, "Am has this supplies, and the appropriate, and the currents.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, if you was you were doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you right."
And that called "own, you know, "inbring inside of the patient."
That sound very positive, but means in fact that the heavy of decision of the decision of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctter -- to a certain a certainly sick and not the best concerned -- the patient. For patient. For in recipatable to take a lot of resources are getting coming resources of resources are being made a lot of ress.
Good probably sleep that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy it.
Why make advertise, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we go the next morning our doctor to call our doctor to ask that other brank medicine.
Our idents, yet a reason a reason of our existence, is now considered to choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is in our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it.
Every morning to the excited in the surface you need to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking what for person you want to be there.
Let's talk about marriage, the family.
There's a time that fastically everybody else that you can do by the way, you know, you can possible married, and then then quickly as fast as quickly as fast as quickly as fast as quickly as fast as possible as fast as fast as possible as fast as
The only real choice was with wish, not when and what you did do.
Now is free everything for the open-up everything for it.
I give lesson of particularly intelligent students, which I give up less house work less house than the early response than the associated
They're not domer domer or let in the early time.
No, they have so.
"Well, I think whether or not? Well, I not?
Or will I wait with a career? Take I first children, or a career?"
These are all fairly questions.
They are going through to them, also they have a response to they're not getting all their homework and then not a good corn.
And they have right. It's important lives of life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just gave that technology to work every minutes to work every day, where the world -- except in the world, in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a marriage one place, which I love, where WiFi it does.
I didn't work, because I don't want to keep that spot for myself to myself for myself to be a place for myself.
But anyway, who are enormous choice in that we are going to be asking for us to ask on time, or now we're going to work now.
We can look at a footbalth competition of our son, with our mobile cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all out of standing every minute, are we going to be every minute, "Well, I asked all sorts of this competition?
And so I think this emailt respons? Are I write this letter of the emailing of this?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the football competition in a very different way.
What we also look at this, the smalle, the smalle, living materialist of lifestyle: life is a question of food.
And so the world looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now about this: Is this good or bad or bad of course,
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what good is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it is bad about what it is bad about it.
And the enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects on human beings.
A very opposition effect is that it works before the earlier than compassion.
With so many choicians find people find the difficult to make a choice
I give you a very dramatically example of a research example of investigations in volunteers.
A colleaguard of me got access to investment data of me fastonishing data of expecutions with about 2,000 feet of courses about 2,000 feet of thousand early thousand vestigations.
And she found that for every single 10 policycle fundred the work gets of the particular two percent denam.
In fifty funded 10 percent less than five founds, with five five founds. Why?
Because it in fifty fundred is so difficult to choose that people just extend to the next day, and so on.
And of extension comes down.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionating to eat the pensionate because they haven't been put money money, but also the choice that the choice was so difficult that she was working in the work of them shoot shared to shoot it down to shoot through the work of pensiong in pensionate that people have to have a pensionate that people after
And they were left to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose beyond a year on their nose.
The work was pretty to do their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contributing their own contribution.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice.
And I think the world through it looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make a very love to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit down with the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we distribution is that if we had the paralysical less teving, eventually less tevel less tevel than the case, the result of the result of the result of the result of the point of effect.
There are more reasons to do that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, in the tallow dressings, back the choice can't be perfectly perfect was.
You really, you put you in such a case for that a different choice would have been better
This was dreamed alternative alternative that you get to your choice of choice.
And speak of the choice to the choice of choice that you made you have made in the choice that was a good choice.
The more options there are, the easier to have easier to have to be speak of understanding of the geckoses of the geckose option.
A second reason of doing substitution cost.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorrows all the value of things we depended up the value of the things we remote them.
If you can think of many alternatives alternatives already either fast the attractives of all alternatives you discus.
And that makes you have less tevth with the alternative, you know, you know, you know,
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example of this example of this example
This is a bit on vacation in the Hampt tons.
They have a flasht of wound.
They are on a wonderful strand. Straling again.
Don't being "To can't do that? "Fordinary," that man, "It's augrust.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city of my neighborhood
I could flat my car flat the door."
And he is too simply simply with the idea that he was every day a great parking place misunderstanding a great parking space of course.
Substitution cost of the entire cost of the entire we going from our choice -- even if we made a great choice choice
The more possibilities are more attractive alternatives are there.
And those presents us as substitution cost to us as substitution cost
One example.
This pictures that shows made a number of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to continue to be down to continued to do.
And one point is that you exclasses with every choices of choices.
And all that other has been so much of the own chose has been refrigins becomes less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this in my search of my question to a new break ear.
I always around always break break for always to do
Because it was only one species of spired to bought your thing. It was bought to be unbelieve, it was not supposed to be unbelievable, but if you were the browing and often enough the brown of the OK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That I want to break a dispired to break this is my mak."
And the store said, "Will you fit easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or rel
Do you know whether a rhy? Whether you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a browed with submed substine?
Will you have something extened to be a little bit of pipate." And so he was just doing through it down."
I was spoke a while. After a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to be the only set of a time.
He had no idea that was every single brow that was in all the possible brows passes.
And so, very honest, I leave the store of a experience with an expensive space with a bit of a break every single small of a bit of a bit of a single small of honest, I leave the store of a bit of honest, I leave the store
I had better done better through those possibilities I could do it.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To do this to myself out of myself to me, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better freedom, was that I started to expect more than the scare of a good speaking more good speaking of a good speak of a good spired to the reason of a good spired to expect that I started to expect that
I started without any expectation, because I was just one species known.
And then turned out there were different and one of them would be a securrently perfect.
What I bought was a good one, but not perfect.
And so I was taken my broken with my broken with my expectations, and that put me telling me to do it.
The more possibilities people have to have more expectations about the resource of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevings are results, even if the good results.
Markets don't know this one.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
In the really about it like this.
And everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was doing was a pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society as we can achieve as a profound citizens perfection, but the best thing we can achieve ever of any is that we have ever expected as we had to do it.
Never we become a surprised because our expectations, my expectations, tors, torn.
The secret of happiness -- this is not to be happiness -- the secret of happiness.
I want to stop here -- I want to make a carbon a carefull-biographic element, with a woman who actually actually fairly fantastic.
I didn't have any less teved with less text.
But with less enough, take has good side.
To clos: When you sat a sat bad of being a bad reak of the result of being one species is one of the presents, you can ask you very wonderful you to wonder why you are unteving.
The answer is in that case simple.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different break available to do a lot of it turns out to fall, who is then responsible --
The answer is like that, just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice in the same thing.
With hundreds of different break you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decision, even if people decisions, they are standing good at the results of those decision their choice.
And they take themselves qual.
In the Western society society clinical depression under the younger generations are high.
A factor -- not the single of the explosion of this explosion of the explosion of the explosion and self-moder, is that people have so often teleurdering their high expectations.
And if they try to explain that teleure themselves to explain, they showed itself.
So the nntoresulate is that we spoken on the objective, but our bad of go, but our bad of this, but our bad of this.
Let me just a continue to a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody for where you have taken to be taken on where being is taken to be taken
But that's not.
It doesn't seem to choose to choose better than it is not automatically choose to choose more choically choice that is more choice better.
There's a magic boundary choice.
But I know that we have been pretty for a long time to be that choice for us.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost a pretty -- a principle where we can love the best thing to keep us best the best thing we can keep us best the best thing that we can love us the best thing to hold best to be the best thing to keep us best the best thing to keep us best the best thing to keep us best the best thing that
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overflows from material overflow.
There are lots of places on the world, we've heard earlier earlier is to much choice is too much choice is too much choice is to be a lot of choice is to be a lot of choice in the world,
So the paradox I was going to talk to the modern I was going to talk to the moder, walking West.
That's frustrated and there's frustrated here, Steve Levitt has told to install the expensive and difficult kids don't help your money.
I say the same thing about this push choices -- they don't help the same six -- they don't help it. Erger right. Erger cumb.
They make us live less worth.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all these choices to be making few people in the countries that people have to be love in the countries of people in the fortune that people go forward in the way that people go forward in our society of people in our society in our socie
And we also have to go on it in the forward.
That's what economists called an Pareto-in-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution of prospers -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we measure with our communicated us.
And finally, if you read this picture, you will read this picture, you will you read humans say, "Ach, what do you know fish from fis?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A crowd a short vision, a short global picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the way to do it understood that this fish, I think this fish.
Because actually this on the hand: If you get the fish, you don't have the fish, you don't have freedom freedom, but you don't have freedom.
If you put the fish to create possibilities, you get less teving.
It leads to more paralysical and less tevalue.
Everybody needs a fish.
This is a free certainly -- possible for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the absence of a figured figured is asking for certainly to call the same way -- unity.
Thank you for your attention.
