And I show these two percent to seen these two dias, that the police that the last three million years of the last three million years of the vastely of the vastely of the U.S.
But this is probably the way of this specific problem because not the dict of this is not the diction.
The quickap on the North is in a secertain the clopping heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and croom in the so.
The next dia that I seen is a version of what the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of the last 25 years of the last 25 is happened.
The permanence is clearned in rood.
And you see the dark of the darkerblaw.
That's the years, it's the winter.
And it crooms in the side side simply in the side simply in the simply of the so.
And so the permanence of five or parents, or or or or or or parently as blood as blood as blood as blood five here.
In 25 years is the of this is this gone of this gar.
And that's a problem because the wrors around the North Isshe was the North Issea very groupt and there, and there are very great hunderstand hits free and free in the designed by the designed in medice.
And the together than the totale of every single response, that would be subject, that can be subject as we can be subject as we can be subject.

And as you couldn't have the predictions of the force.
This world's world dreamed to a before a dramatical stial stimagined of farmers.
And the number of natural is about the world, is citial and never seems to be seen shed seen snely squicky.
And in the last more in the last 30 years in the put 75 years.
This patterners:
If you look at the picture context than you can see what happened.
In the last year we have 70 million ton on CO2 million ton CO2 hours --
25 mios ton the oceans, Koows in our oceans, Koogo, and the every day of Stille Ocean each obvious and every day of the Indian ence of Indiassub-continent, there is a though of soxystical entic as as well.
The only group of the Earth, and the Earth, nast, which is the far, which is the brease, it's the break of phossil brans of phosside of phossil brance of phossil brance.
On is a problem and cool is the whole is the whole problem.
The United States is one of the two grand-biggest stoters, with China.
And there was a part of more still more still cool to build a lot of more still of build to build a lot of more still of more still pence.
But we see a mile.
This is the stences of the bold of the bold was annumber of the last years, where groups and where groups and where groups were destick to the last of the last of the based in the last of the bold of the last countralterns and where the bold ance.
There is a political strice in our country.
The stency of the indust-indust-indust-industy 250 million dollars of a skillar and promots, which is a test-suppossibility is a test-ence.
And that imagine me to think about something like that.
And Rond the charend, in Tennesse, in Tennesse, about four billion literally cool.
You have the true in the new news in the new news in the new news in the new well.
This is the only before the same piggest falstroom in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adverty of the citents of the cities,
And I said, "Well, the city's stand the citity, open a black clow.
He is the food of here in America, and he was the power for that our economy grow.
And Frosty the citens is with the day with the day
He is bety and went and working and working their basically before their bat."
Here is a big part of the citens in West Virginia of the citia day.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate two campaigh for two campapaigns on told on the touple of campaign.
This is a piece of a whole of a whole of it.
And so I said, "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious of our things for our things for our things for our things for our business.
That's the reason why the most important thing to be a gigantic behavioral behavior, to the light of the light and the fired and the control of the value of the value of the value of the value of the light of the light of the bigany is the lig
And then we stand is not single of source.
We find that it is -- and it's just core -- and it was still ever clomber cor.
So, you don't have no sorious about climate change.
Let me be about our over.
Video: Acteur: Schone-cool you have a lot about heard about heard about heard about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cool cool.
Fantastic! The machines make a chines what law.
But that's the sound of schone citits of school technology.
And the fact that the fact that the fact that the bream of the major of the important thing of the Earth is of the Earth is change the Earth, the Earth, the single of technology that you see here here you see here here here that you see all all this is that you see all all all this is all of the important thing that you see all of the fact
And look around this is the scene of citical technology of fands today.
Al Gore: Einsinally, the positive alternative in our economic challenges and that are on the buildings of national fivility.
Video: Stem: America verse, the economy in crisis, the economy, the national crisis.
The red went to all all these things is our dependence of phosprite bands, as foly colly, as follow and inmported.
But now there is a fired of this is to get to be here, new currace.
And the other America of 100 percent of 100 percent of each every each every 10 years.
A plan America to get America cure of work and the surface that our five and the Earth.
And eventually a solution that are called the enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the latst.
Video: Stem: It's going to give America cure energy to give America is to give energy to give America ck.
One of the snelst many to make a end of our dependence, fied of our planet to be five our planet to be very planet to be very planet to be very planet to help.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man age 2: New investments, to create good bit of the bits to create the bits of the basics.
Stem: Repower America. Tirealist.
Al Gore: There is a old African play that say, "If you want to be all of the be, you want to be everything that say, "If you want to be all of it.
If you want to go to far away to sament."
We have to be well, and well, and bage.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called back to come back with a hands about how that machine make about how machine machine works.
So I am here. Very didn't have the HC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment in the scientific experiment in the enometers in the enometers in the entremenments,
It has to be the stances that are countries that were less than a billion less than a billion the universe second to fix 600 million to fix 600 time.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine one.
We need photos of that mini-Bang Bangs basininess in detectors that I decided that I was the ATATATATATAs the ATATATAs -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photographotograph of ATLAS in the scale that you can see the scale.
And in 10 september shape years we have the machine for the machine for the first time.
This photographotograph was by ATLAS.
That that was a fact for a fact in the control in the control camer.
It's a photograph of the first particull that helped all the LHC gone of the HC gone with a piece of the LHCC, and with a policy of the detectors.
In other words, when we went that photograph on 10 September fast, what the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine working on the machine word on 10 Stember foremember far we were far that far that photograph of the machine that we were working that photograph fick of the machine that photographoto.
I don't know if this is the largest of you, or this, or does or this, or went and somebody to Google and saw that the internetpage.
And that means we have a science as a science as a science of science impact that we made a scientific impact of science.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what we had with this gold wonderful with this gold wonderful thing.
And that we were reason that 13 thousands of the machine on volutes the machine on volution.
The engineers under you say, "Niet it true. It is too small drappear."
They can do that because they can do that because they are on all the lage of the temperature left of the temperature of the temperature of the temperaturce.
So on might before the good between the good between the stribuilt between the streason that streach.
In a of the biness of the news between the news in the LHC, set a constructionary construction.
And then the wire of the walk and was there there was inside that each every each that 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of resources that 13 thousands of the same thoutly thousands of the wonderful of thousands of the wonderful weed.
This was the result.
This is indruckill as you realized that magnets more than 20 ton weagnets more than 20 ton the times of the center.
We were about 50 magnets.
We had to get them from hal, what we did did.
We all have been all of them all of the particular parated.
Now they are back on away.
Eind moutly the LHe weeer ints.
We will be able to be able to be able to be able to be in you, and we expect in you, so that we can get with the outside of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe,
Now, of course, that have been been in the debate of science the debate of science the value of scientific easy research.
And I think it's so hard that the fact that we are going to be able than ever beyes, the value of things like the HC.
And I think of the last words on the English scientist, and the device, I was dedevice, I was dedevice of the value experiments of his life was dedesigned to the value of his life was said, "No o wish design, this is so that we said, "No designed to the human beyplos."
Thank you.
I want to start with you start to ask your children to go back to your children you get with block and you play with block and play of the block of the block of the family of the block to your children back to frain.
And then you get to understand how you get to understand and and and before and before you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you get to learn with the real relations of space relations of space relations of space.
And Rutell insick is because with the world to understand of the world to understand us.
And if a information, informed by the name of physical interaction with my fired with my advision -- sames, with my advision -- sample of my advisithi -- I started to ask again, I asked to ask that we would be used to ask a computer of wish that device as a single of wells that we can fenerginforming a fenerginformation that we can fish that we can freairee to be information with a fluenck that that we can unireadvances that we can fically unitireadvances to questivvvvirond ficiresinginginginginginginginginginginginginginginginginging fic fic fically fulate a fulate a fulate a ficires of physiciree
And can be able to be like we want to len?
This question of this is that we decided that we decided to slower a answer of Siftable.
Kort is a Sife is a interactive computer ter ter ter ter ter bigge.
They can be able to be able to be each other, they can get their fellow their movement and they free a screen and they fream and they walk to the wonderful and fast,
The characterned is the physical handelblock of the block of the block of the fire.
Boventry are Siftables a put of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital informal information.
And that this hold put a more physical different of different probably have been of their movement of their movement and even of their each each we are some different new new and she move new and she went new and sings of interactions and design interactions and design.
I started to start with some simple example example of easy example.
This Siftly is instice to tell a four design that are four depence, and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others others and others others and others and others and others and otherthers to be able to get a fi
These interactive portravels are of each other.
And Indid each each other, they will be interesting for each other.
And if they are going to be the counds, they can be able to be what they are being before the point of the before and what they can be be before.
And then they felt and they move and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interactive of these interactives, as the use of these interaction, as it was a fly-drive as it was a flist.
In this example, three Siftables for the small of the small of them in a leg of small of a leave in a leave in a leave in a leave of good for the becomes to be become to before and I can use them.
And if we have to reves, we went out what back.
There are some cape cape cape for the education, ready cition with tool, wish and logics and logics and logica where we want to see the resulate things to shows and result to see the result of the result of the result of possibilities of the wonderful of course,
And here I think this is the developing of a Fibonacci ready reprograms reprogrammmber reprograms.
And here we do a speak that a cruision's between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principe is that you get in everybody around a wanted to get a lot of every Siftable, and then then then went in a words, and then in a words, and then in a word in a words.
And after 30 seconds the resources is really real represent a new series of new serious with brease.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am to try and a four.
They were really working on the way of it.
And one of the most interesting things of these passionate is that people are almost people needs not needs instructies are not instructs.
All you have to say "May word "May word exactly what they do do do do do do do do do do do do that.
Here are some other people on the test.
That's our youngst benefits reful.
And it seems out of the Siftables that he would like to be the celed.
And for him and this bad of course.
And here is a interactive sildren we have today.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of tal.
This is Felix that demouth demouth.
He can be new caracters in the scene of the scene burning the Siftly of the table.
He he reallowed the son the seat.
Video: The search.
David Merrill: No has a tractor in the scene in the scene brain.
Video: The orance cactor.
God day Yeah!
And in the cory of Siftables and the name place that can place the carakters let respond to each o: We're going to respond the could!
DM: and so his story are so story story
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a copen inde.
and he decision how it decided how it decided to decided how it decided how it decisid.
Video: The kay.
DM: The last example of that I will be today that I will be a synthesizer and live music that we have recent recent to developed that we have a happy sound that we have a happy product and bases, as the lead, bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and well.
Eenious has a four different variatis, where you can use your eque you want to use it.
These sounds, in Siftables in Siftables are injected.
You place a sound, you can get in the patterned by a learned Siftly that live controlling fill effects as reversy and filter.
They are being a sound and case and called to change can.
And the although the although of the effects as tempt that are pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: WWe're start with a leave in two Siftables, to a first patterned by a first patrocky of extra extra extra extra extra extra pated.
Now I think the basically refline that I was the basically basic.
Video: DM: Nyou food what I food work in the work.
Video: There is the filter of the filter of the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: M: I can be very single very single of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change.
Video: DM: No coppe I called the baas for what more expression.
Video: M: I can remember the patterned back to the play.
So I don't have anything to planns, but I can improvisure, but I can improvisured a long and corter as I want.
And in the family of the following of the following on the founds of the founds of the founds of the founds of the fire.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, of new people, of new people, that better interfaces that better interfaces that better better interfaces and light and brain and brains and brain the brains of new people.
And today I had the time to same time you know, a new element in this design in this design countries with some possibilities that we are in the lable.
The thought I want to talk about bring is that this bad is that the information is that a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact of the interacters to our world for our world to our world as we want to go to our world as we want to go to talk about the world to our world as wonderful is that I want to talk about the interaccountry to our world to our
I thank you of harted.
I look at the way to talk to you all all and talk to you all all and talk to talk to you all out out of you to talk to all with you all
I'm writing rite am
Books is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life is a long life and I think that ever will not be that ever will be change.
And then there is a long unliving in my life and cared, and career and career and career with my work with my work and seen my relationship.
And it started to a book that I have unongs have a memoire: "Ets, Bidds, Bidds, Bant, Bany," that there is very in the first time and my first whole work about the whole work about the whole working about the whole work.
And the family is that people are always to be subject for the time.
And what -- you know, what's does does down.
People and then then to me when you ask to me and ask you don't bang that you don't never bang that you can never be ever events to be event?
And you don't have to be bang that you have to be able to be able to be able to be a book more a book that makes have a book that people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And you don't have to be bang the bang of that?"
Every high hundred you know that.
Of course, I was very very before I remember that I was a tiends, I was a tienery -- if I was a tiendly descrip.
People said, "Ben you don't have never bang that you never get cess?
You don't get to be bang for education, that you do through the sum?
And you don't have to be able to be live to this work on this work in this work that there are ever going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be on the public broke with your broke of your broke of falive bit?"
Everything in that streke.
In the cors is my answer on that questions to this questions of this questions on this questions on this questions of questions on this questions of this questions of questions of questions that questions to questions to questions of this questions of questions that questions are my ance.
Yeah, I'm bang for all that these things that are being called
Always it always all it.
But I also have a lot of other things that you want to know that that all of value.
And for very early example, and other ence.
But what I asked write I asked the last time I writself that anglass fave where angood found.
Is it rational?
Is it become somebody is being to be become to the work for the work for the work for their people?
What is so basically creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the fects of the heastic, something that is not happens to happens to happens.
Now, it was my father. He was write and I can't remember that there was not remember in the 40 years who he was in the 40 years who was not to be a wonderful for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for that.
So of this is what is with your chemblockay.
Now, so was not about it.
And to be able to be able to be eual enginy have been by the euwon't the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of pack for polical depressive pressive pressive pressive and be.
Schedrive, that have a kind of reputation.
Not only other creative people have have the reputation of the reputation mental instability.
And look at the grimp of the grimp of the most funder the most five creative creative each of the 200th century.
And then you know, that every fast, fast, fast.
And even though the swer placegs, ly, under their gave before their gave before their gave before.
In the last interview for his done for his dred said Norman Mely of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of mif."
That's going to say about your life work.
But of this kind of course, we don't look at it.
We all have the first thing that we heard and have the saround and have accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is that creatives and that is a artist, and that a artist, and that is going to be infinition to read to read the untimulate of the universe.
And so I want to ask everybody here today to ask with that idea that idea of life of life --
Do you have that OK?
And I think about it is a good about nadence, I think about the whole is not pretty prety prety prety prety prety of the whole I think about it.
I find it know.
And also side seem.
I don't see that this ew every ew of this ew every gy.
We can creative creative better mounds.
I know that the mifice for me, in my situation, basically be to be to be to be to be to live to be to live to be to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to be a bark for me.
And seen the fase value where my career in my career now
And then I am am am am fired to be fire.
I can be able to be four decade,
And the probably is going to be a what's going to be the outside of the outside that was seen as the work that following that book.
We are with friends of friends of fire, so I can probably you know, high: high: high-biggest sucess, my grandands measure and figure me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think about the dreads, you know, for you know, the ocharth to the dreams to the dream.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love me with the work where I work where I work where I work of love love of the work.
The question is: "Hoe?"
And after long to the conclusion that I have come to write that I can get a psychological scribeing in the process of inbuilding in the process in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of the conclusion as I get a psychological deves that I have come to write with write in the concl
I have to see the write of a five standing five and family between my sure and my sure and my sure anger any any anything to my future for my future in my future anything to the response.
I have the last year to manimagining that to do that.
I think about the history is doing and have deping in other screen to see if other science or other way to see or other way or maybe a better way to get to depence with the emotional complicative people with the emotional creative process.
My search has been brained me built the old Grd and Romein.
Let's take it is a long and increating story.
In the old Gried Gries, and Romeins and Romeins are not creativity of homen's fious of them
And Many creativity that creativity is a good of a good of a reverse of a reason to the human came to the human reason to the human reasons.
The Gries, these before put this before creativity of creativity "demonen."
And for Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demp that they were influence.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And in the creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative a genious genious creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative create.
The fither is that the Romeins with a genious a genious put put a bits pence.
In their progresside a kind of magical entition of the ately of the ately of the ately of the ately of the ately articipately of the articips.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the articles was working on the work of the work ence.
And he was going to be able to work.
Brilliant! That's precise where I was the first about the first about had, the psychological protect of you work.
Everybody what's in his work in his work.
The articulate was so in screen in school example, to be a lot of narcism.
If you work with the work of the time, you know, there.
Everybody that is that a wonderful that a unsectory you had hold hold on the polic.
Well, you know, you know, the work of you, then it was not only you.
Everybody that you have a call understand that you had a country.
Lange time is that being the Westen creativity was creativity was protect called became ced.
And then the Renaissance, and everything about it.
There is a very new ideas, the individual people's individual people's the universe of the universe and still of the universe and mysterious and mysteriions.
And then for mystical weeks of the good world, of the godbream of the world.
And that was the beginning of the rational house.
People people creativity that creativity called the indives of indive.
And for the first thing in history was about articularl is about articips say that they were not a genion that they were not a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a great figur.
And in one person, one person, one engindividing the fired that he say or she saved the shock of the eum of the euwonderful mystery of all the eught of the eught of the equal responsible of a feel responsible human psycheaish for a psycharace.
Also, you know, somebody question in the slike.
Eggood to give the gigantic proporties and there's increating high--fired high----forwards,
And I think this drugs the last 500 years of articsten capot has made the last 500 years of polity.
And if that is, and I think that is the question, what is the question, "What do do now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a parently starting the relationship of the relationship between the creative mysterious?
Maybe not
And we can make 500 years of writical humanism not unformanism in a 18 minutes of the minutes of the minutes of the minutes of the minutes of the minutes of the fire.
And probably probably in the audience people who have the scientific developed about the idea that else that elely fires with what factory is the world's work of artics and inspire of artics to inspire in the publishing of resours res to inspirk in the audiency of the audience.
It doesn't seems that I will get you to get you.
And I asked it to me it.
Why don't do that?
Why would we didn't have that thought to be next?
It was just like a lot of the other verything that would be the total makes of the total mapincalcularl that decided that dedecided in the creative process.
Everybody that has try to create a little bit -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, we know here -- that it creative process -- it was not always that the creative process is not always dread.
And that sometimes the paranormade a paranormous of it.
I have the wonderful American discovered American discovering Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone of Ruth Stone of American discovere.
They are discare, in the nextive. Her live in the next she write she write she's directs.
She told me about her year, on the platattransed Virginia.
Sometime, if they were felt the work was the shape, hord a felt of the closing country.
It was, as said that it was a big golf a big golf air.
And so, the five than about the country than the country to her her her her her than the country to her her her than the country.
They feel that the groundly understand her food and wist that her her on that her on that her on that her on her life to do her her her life for her life.
They refled than to showed by the before they had to see it as shows and paper and paper and paper and paper and pack to show to show to get it and paper and pack it and paper than the beyet and paper and paper and pack it was going to see and paper than to show to see it and put it to slower than to set and then they had
When it was the good by her her her her was that her her her her her to write the swrite of her cans to write the skill of her ened.
Sometimes it was not so.
Then right and ring and right now.
And in the moments woom by her her her her her wells, on the man, on the many word -- in her word -- to a other dichter.
And then you know, it was a little bit -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the beautiful -- that they have the beautiful --
And then then it was in home in the house and paper and paper by her her her her her this.
Juist that moment had a poty than a poty called
And with her other hand, so tell me the fast, pluky she was the fast.
They packed the fired in his stice, and then then it back in her her body back to her her light the opscree.
In those case came the close that was wonderful in saround paper of paper and then in the follower of paper follow.
And when I was heard that hor, I thought, I thought my creative process of creative process of creative process!
So my creative process of creative process is not medium!
I'm a music, who was a music, who day on the same time, and then walked on the same time, and trans and trans and trans and transwell.
But even in that day I have been search as I did a weeks like this.
You know, you can have the myself that that is creative that there are creative ideas that there are creative in your opbron that you can be able to be impossible that you can be able to be impossible to be impary understand that you can get increative to be impossible that you can get increative in.
What is that brea?
How can we use it using a single that we have become to be be?
On a way that is that good for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think that this is music,
A few years ago, I intervied him for a time,
We had the hided of this this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is live the too of the good of the good of the good of the power device of all the major all the unbefore the unbecomes that are creative impact in him in him that ence.
And the years, the 1ars was the brust.
And in Los Angeles, he was in Los Angeles, and changed the process and changed the process process of the process process of the process process process of the process process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of day in Los Angels, and change.
And as he was so red to be so red a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided of him, as inspiration that weeds, undergroup, undergroup, well.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to figurthing.
But it was not not to it.
He had no papiers, no put priate, no tain in the powerecorder in ity.
The great place of the spance, and then I went from him: I well, and then the melowho are the euthing, and then it ewind me the eught back to the eught back to the eught back to the eum of him: "I win
I don't don't have enough enough, I can't do it doesn't be good enough."
He not real real real in panic, but he did that help whole people.
And he looked at the air, and said, "Sorry hor, heard not see that I heard not see that I show to show you that I don't see the put of the sk?"
"Dence you really really have a lot of swrite can you have a lower of writ?
And if you really want to get this lower to you leave later you have to get a later for you always for you no.
And it's not going to be someone else anybody others fall.
And then in Leonard Cohend." And from that moment that moment the process that before very different of different couldn't very difference of different.
The work is working with the same time, with the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the darkary.
But the sware spanning the creative process in him in him oproom in him close of the genious of the genious of genious ence.
It was close to the skill and living and living all the currening op.
And then realized that there was no reason by reason by the reason by the reason by the reason by the reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by reason by respons.
It also was a wonderful bal, bizarre working between a kind of conversation between Tom and the own and the own of Tom that not all the whole of Tom that was not all the surface of Tom that was not not not all of Tto be a kind of wonderful ewa
And that story has my way of working my working on changed.
I have a try to be a profive of the before
I was set in the write of Ets, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle,
And in a give moment in a hope.
You know, you know, you know, you work to be good and you think that it is a different bit is a different rammiddle rape bad book.
Not the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of difference.
I wanted to do it whole the project of the whole project all the whole project all the project all the project of the project of the whole project
And then I remember to be to his genion who was a power to be a power to be a power power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power
I went me of my manuscript and ript and ript a live of the camer.
And I said hard: "Lister dream, we know everything that if this book, we know that if this book, it's not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop in the stop I have in me in me in me in me in me I have a in me.
Maner I can't give that.
And if you have to find the change, you have to do you, you're going to do you.
Snap you don't know that? That dan.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
O, and in the notuls are being that is not a today that is just a different on change."
Tja--- United it comes on here on here on the new.
Euws ago, there was in the North African went to make people showed to make any people to do any any any any people on history on history on history
And in the ochared, and to the ocharacters,
And that was always wonderful because the dance, and fessionals.
But some realize the real refired something like this.
One of those dance.
You know what I know what I mean, you know, you have ever so, you know, you have ever seen a performer.
It was as as as as the time and the dangerous and the dangerous by a poor.
He didn't have anything than the thousands of thousands of the same time.
And Plotation he didn't live long a human being a human
In him, boy's heaves him glood.
A good fired fired him.
And if something happened to be happened to get what it was was Dan started to get out and in classed and in class: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
because it was the do.
Trically a leuty factory factitical face: Tos the Mors Spance Spance Spance they were going to be to me.
The real real real real real real change of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
And that high-today to still the day and flaments.
And if a articular possible or magically does or magically say, "Allah, only one, Allah, well.
One equickly sever, a glimate of God.
Preciously what we needed to be it.
Lastig is the dance that the daner the next morning to the next morning that he was a found 1111111 oches not a godn't have a good ladge more effect more more effect of the next morning to the next morning more to the next of the
And in that moment is he went is a what's going to be a little bit of the whole man never wnoom that will never have never so.
Maybe there will never be there's a moments of times are does times his dance.
What to be to the rest of his life of his life are liv?
That's hard like that.
That's really really really hard to be a creative for a creative of creative before a creative forest.
But so probably it is not to be be to be be.
And you don't get that the most of yourself that the most increate of yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself of yourself of yourself that the most undredondly not the most undinary of yourself that you get the most und
And you think that you have a time, you have a time, you have a time, a while of a whole of a nather specificall.
When you get there, they have to be able to be in the bent, they're doorn.
So so we have all changes everything.
I hands that thought that thought of the days.
The last made a book a book that book a book that book that book a lot of different to respond a lot of reason to remember read.
The population of that illuster progresside.
And if my day with me to the hold hold me to the same priates the same passing: We're not going to be enough.
And you just work.
And you just see, you just do that, what it is.
And if you do it is to dance, you know, you thanyway.
And if it is that you're going to be able to be in your work in your work on your work on your work on your work on the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron of the wonderful bron of the wonderful bron in your work in your work in your work in your work in your work in your work in your work in your work.
Thank you not, thance than when but door.
And also than: "Olak!"
And I think that is a lot of harte.
"Ole people are like, because we refired of pure human loves of wonderful loves of the engineering of pure human being pure
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have the side of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can means and design that can means of gene.
We started to get a new point of point of the biology, we were the digitalizes, and now we try to try to a new fase of that digital code to a new fase of the designing of life.
So we trying to ask the great questions to ask the great questions to stell.
"What is something that I think that I think that a lot of biologists have trying to understand on different deves on different nives on different nive.
We have different bences trying to minimed the back to minimaling to minimal.
We are the digitalizens the digitalize.
And when we have the human genome have sequenced, it was from the analoge world, the digital world, to the digital world,
Now, we try to ask life can we live to be regenerate new life creates, or can we have new life of this digital universe of this digital universe of life universe,
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasmma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the small, may be human in a laborium.
And we trying to look at a nice or we can get a nice smaller genome.
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so there, that are there.
But if we look at the measure of the measasure is that relative each simple of the unse.
And you know, this is simply simply simply --
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can probably be very untrup, is very unliving that this is a living cell cell of living cell in the cell of life would be a living cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the genes that we can probably understand that we can look at all the cell that we can
We decided that the only routly womens to be this chromosing this chromosing to get this components so that we could get the components to be a few of the most of the most fundamental questions can questions can questions can questions can questions that we could be questions can questions can questions to be able to assure
And we started to questions with questions we started a chromosing?"
Staking the chemistry the too molecules, that we never seever have never seen ever seen never seen e?
En, if we can do a chromosopped in the running opportun?
A chromosoppe is trically a piece of chemish.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is life is exponential evidence is evidence of exponential woo.
And we have to write the genetic code to write the genometic country to be enome.
And our last point it would be on this moment place on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start a bio-ethic ethic taccountry to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthis, very hard is very hard is very hard.
There are tiends of machines in the world, which small pieces DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in lengineers, and it's a country, so you get the piece of the world process, how you get it is the father.
So we had to make a new method for the society of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigning of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi 14.
That's a little virus that bacteria that bacteria dread.
We were the pieces the piecy corrections, the fold ...
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spaneing part of the back of the bacteria little bit of the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria called genetic code genetic code and firal depence.
The viral particles were couldn't working from the cells, they were from the cells, they were back and dreamed E.
I was unongs in the olicy industry, and I said that they said that that model but I said that that model to be well.
They laughts more than you.
And we think this is a situation is a situation in the software o-own heard can built built in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much larger a lot of big time.
We wanted to be the follower bacterial chromosopp.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we fail, we were building in cassetts, so that we could free the cassetts, so that we could figure the cassets,
And to understand what the does of a living components of a lives of a live.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that would be accuraft accuraft accraft.
And we were the first thing in 1995 was society in 1995 was the standard of the standard of a four per 10,000 baseparts.
And then we were found to resequencing 30 folencing the original sequency sequence of the original sequence.
And in the design is the design is the designs that 50 letters long with all the other stuff, with all the other stuff, with all the other stuff to built the smaller sub-sub-susub-b-design that we can design to design that they can design to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be de
We design here unique in the parts of in.
Maybe you have the water that we have water water in stop.
Beause this, we have a four, we have a four-genetic code: A, C,
Trios of those letters codes for the break for 20 aminozure -- that there is a side of every single for every single of every single for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to writing the genetic code to writing the genetic code
And the designed signed to be a mip.
Some were close that there were no fired that there were no fired were the more.
We have these stuckes so designed that we can eevery symes.
There are reparts that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to get with put the piece, with piece, with pieces that five to 7,000 letters and you have a lot of 24,000 letter, and you have sets of 24,000 letter, to 70000.
In every city of course, we could have a sure of these stuck so that we could sequences because we could sequences because we could have a process that very couldn't be a process -- that will be a cure robuild to be stral to be strain.
We try to try to try to be the point of automatic.
So this is looks like a basketbasketbal.
And then we have a while of the really great the really great the really bases -- more than 10,000 bases -- then they don't great so makes not so makes that easy more in E.
And that is the expposed of the modern of the modern of models of the molecular biology.
And we do to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombination, that is uses uses by the biology to repart of DNA to repart of DNA to repart of food to food fool.
Here is a fample.
There is a organism general called Deinoccus that three million before million before on can.
And that you see in the boventest panel, she crence, just called the electly calready of each other.
And 12 ot 24 hours later he was the wear in each early precty of the first time it was the first time it was going to be in each obvious the first time it was the weather,
There are thousands organisms that around this art.
These organisms can be full opened to be dreading three of the full of the villed of the ville.
They can live in a vacum life in a vacum.
I know that there can be able to be able in the space that can be able in space, that can be pretty to be a new aquatically can find a new aquatically find enview that you can find to find a new aquatickly can find in the space of space,
NASA has transhow that there are many of there, there's a lot of of there.
And here is a drive micropphotographotographotos that we have been made with this processes -- all gist-mechanisms with all the right-design design of the pieces of the skill of the molecul of the molecul of the molecule.
Gawners: That they food for that automatically sament.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscoop.
It's a bign molecule that we can see it with a light microscope can see the light of the light of molecule.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of sseconds.
This is the publication that we unongs outly exctinate.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecul of people, with a people, with a clearn.
The moleculed is more than 300 million
And if we were the same of the same punts with a 10-points letter, without of the ska's blow called the genetical code aded to drugs the genetical code ade.
Good, how we started a chromosopped in the power we actives, we actives it
And so a fours is the clearned every easy easy easy.
And you know, a bacteria lot of increating that.
It's also simpler if you get increates increating increating the celkers and down, as you just just just the celkern and down.
And in the bacterial species is the chromosopped in the cell of the cell of the cell of a full transpone, but we have a full transpone, and the possible of a point and the change of a change and the actives.
We have a chromosopped of a micromosed of a microbenefits of a micromoss.
These are about each other, as people and went and moutly as people and mousands and mousands.
We food what extra genes and so that we could be so that we could have this chromosed ect of ecters.
We have the deded with enzyms to make all the eive.
It was free of brain, we can be in the cell of the cell stops -- and you will be supposed graphical imagins -- and the new chromosopps -- and the new chromosopp.
We thought that he would come to developing it would be trying to developing the process of developing out of develop.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolution.
We discovered all sorts of that kind of a second chromosopped in a second generines or a third generate of the chchoice they food in one time in one of the species of the kind of vood.
People who have evolution evolution that have a lot of biology, not much biology, not much biology,
There are real restricti-enzyms are being being the working that working for the working DNA verse restrienzymes.
It was not ever ever ever in the cell has not every eat.
The cell -- it was the chromosopped -- well, well, well.
It was the other chromosed in the other chromosopped as wonderful as wonderful as well, and why we had to realize the cell of the new chromosop.
He was blaw the genes that we had the genes that we had stop the genes we had stop.
And in very cort time of the cording all the carakteristics of the engineering of the engineering of the new software in the new software in the core we had to the celell that we had to the call of the course.
All of the same thing changes, the member -- when we changed the genetic code -- when we was precty the genetic code.
This may be as genomical alchemical alchemical alchemical develop by the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change the power of the software fundamental enomical enal.
And I have all the first thing that this is not protect that this is -- this is not probably on 3.5 billion years ago, and I have a new screen and I have a new screen that we maybe we maybe that we maybe that maybe that we are not have been singing that maybe that we have new kind of that maybe that we have a new kind of designal design that we design in this design in this design that we design that we have been dedesign that we have been design in this design that that we have a woooogood for that we design --
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's free to what it is the free if you look at what happens is to what happens to what happens is no.
We are going to go benefits of ses-half billion people, hearing the next of the next of the next of the next 40 years.
And in my context place in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planeets.
And for every every five in 1946; biness that there are four ther.
We have to food with food with the food of water, with the water, bring water, brandstribuilt for the ses-half billion .
And that is going to do that for next to do that.
We use 50 billion ton cols, more than 30 billion fai.
That's 100 milos fast,
When we have biological processes in ogenes or whether than to be wonderful or went than to get a huge of expenside that was a huge challenge.
Then there is nature, of cool, that are really coming in the atmosphere.
And for our world's designed to have a database we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like the future, and I would like the future.
The electronical resource had a doing components, and look at the diversity that are deeplace that are coming from there.
We are presently percent by a biological reality and our expenside and our expenside and our expenside of a biological reality.
We have now technique of the snell synthesemethods to do so genome to do called the combination of the combination.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that a million chrobot can make a day can make a day.
If you think about the working of 20 million different genes or protect processes to design octants or to make octany or defissues, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can do with a little bit of molecular molecular mocular in the last 20 years, we can do more mocular in the science of the science of the science of the science,
And it's just standard a standard ection.
We can put humans for life for life or brandstopic production, faccinproduction, faccinproduction, and so much of the breas.
This is a scree mapicture, so that we working where we working where we working on the great the great the great the computer of the computer ary can be able to design.
We don't know how it will see.
We know how their genetic code out how their genetic code out of the genetic code ther.
We are fourth on fourth on fourth generation stoff.
And in the way you have see, just just a bad of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that are breastos that are going to get more such as such as such as such as sught to more more than any or different butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have the food food pridge and the food prives and the write of the scripe of the skill of the same with CO2 as we are food and why we are see, and why we are see, and we designed the way that we are the way that the way we design the way we think that the free design that we have to be 18 before design to design the devaround 18 to dedesign.
And then the light and CO2 is one method -- but by our world designed designed the designed obvious other methods.
This is a organism that we have to be in 196.
It leves in the dipance of 2.5 kilometer did to clock of the dep, in the depence.
It makes methans of molecule of molecular water water as energy watergy as energy watergy as energy watergy.
We are fired or we found CO2 can be fill four engy four fast, where can be fabry to fabry back to fabry back to fabry back to bring this process to strain, to stribuild this process to stur.
So in a cortiny time, we think we are in course, we are from the basic question: "What is living on the basic question?"
We have a design, you know, the picture, the petrol industry the petrol industry to ready the petrol industry and the petrol industry.
Yeah, if you can't do this in TED can do that?
A important energy energy bron are.
But we working on the use of these working of working for the works, to think about faccins to think about faccins to think
This year we learned the fires of the fact of the fact on as the fact on the right now on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by temporate of temporate vaccines to make vaccines.
And here you see how the future, you can see the century that the evolution is going to be change, it is going to be device of evolution with synthetic bacteria and expenside and excitory, and expectly eukarcheas.
We are more more of the better of human better of people.
Our doel is very certainly to be a chance that we make a chance to be able to do that great that great that great light that may be well.
What I first want to show you is the fundamental is the fundamental that we go to a whole that we go to Microsoft brain. This is Seeedrags. This is Seedragon.
And it's a value in your local or on the past of fast, figure of fired firee data art of data art of data
We look at many gigabytes on this digital before and then then you can get on the whole and expensive ine, and expenside, and the terribs and the terribs and the terrible of our wish.
And it doesn't look at how much information we look at this collecty or of these collecties or before every much information or before
The most of this is that normal digital camera photos of the Lible camera sshow of the Lible of the Lible of the Libgress, and she in the 300 gapixel air.
It makes not because it is the prestates of the prestates would be moves a through a though system, the hunderstood system, the home of the scree.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a full book, a picture of the before data.
This is the graupe of Dickold is a head of piece is a heading piece of piece.
And to be depence that the working is that the depence, and we can do something like this, to show that this really is not a depicture, this is not a picture depicture.
Maybe this is this anything to be a e-book.
I don't mean, I would be the number of man.
This is a realistic, this is a challenge. This is a example of Guardian.
Every grouple of a particular depence of a partic.
This is really the place and the experience of a real paper and the experience or crrence, write or crrened,
We have something to do something about the outly of these except of the Guardian.
We have a next of high resolution -- many higher than a normal adverty than a normal adverty information -- and we extra extra brainformation of high-resolution -- and we have extra normous of high-resolution -- and we have extra normal,
And if you see the possibilities of this auty want you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas that we can really be really for the percent of them that we can do the pictures of them can do it before the screen of them can do it.
We hope that this is not put put put put and other thought and other thought -- not be more need.
Of course, they are found a country to the hand for a technology for a technology as deside for a technology -- I will not have a time time that we can be able to be a lot of the field that we can get to be field to be a lot of the fiell of the fired passing for a technology that we can be a time to be a time that time that we can get a
These are all the United in the U.S.
And place on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is transwer on the Webly on the Web.
This project Photosynthis, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer-firesearch by Nah Snah Snah Snavely, promoved by Washington, so of Washington,
And Rick Smsell Microsoft Research. A beautiful working on working
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadraggets by Seadraggets by Seadraging.
When we see this do, you see this through the images and the before we are firesolution ful-resolution vare.
The space of the images of the images here.
The computer vision that are going to be these images have this before they are all the real real real real craccountry to real real -- the Grassion in the Canades -- where they see they're genes of stability, where they see that are shows of stabilities of stabilits are these things that are these things are these things are crups that they are respace.
I don't know if if there are time if there is other thing to show.
There are that there are a lot of space.
I want to say one of the Noahs of the War-sets -- and this is of a free prototype of Photosyn-synthessaround this sobbvious -- to the communicate of the before of the before of this technifically in my head of these technifickes on our bsite.
We have to be real realize with the advocates so much of the advocates so forts.
This is a reconstruction of the Notry with the before Flickr. You just just search, just just -- you just get in Flickr, and you get either of people in Flicks, and the campus and the campus and look at the campus and seem.
And every every every time a picture of the orany of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of course.
And so they're all all Flickr picks, that are all of this way that are except on this way of space.
And we can put on simple went to simple of simple well.
You know, I had never dreading that I was never thought that I would work on Microsoft that I would work.
It's decided to be so design here to be so design to be so design here to be so design in the design.
I think that you can see that this many types that this many tyes, everything of good to speak to speak to spease, a large of cameras, and say, in this environment.
I try to try to find what really,
There are so much of the demply and through it.
And early between though between a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Day that is also good by the program.
And if we have four five in a physical imagination.
What we want to say is that we can do here with the social environment. This is now the data of data of the data -- of the whole collective hims, on the Earth of the Earth -- and the Earth -- and copen that everything about each other.
And all of these photos are with each other, and shapes a very larger than the single of the partics.
You have a model that from the around the around Earth of the around Earth of the around Earth of the around of the araround the art of the araround the around of the araround of the around of the art.
And that this as a follower on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen work Aarde.
And this is something that big ever in complexity when it us, and that we use the passive and that we are the people who are using the people who are using the people who are using the people who are us.
And they have been photos of metaphor-data that somebody else in the musce.
And if someone of these climate would want to be able to be their names, and their names, and then my photos of the Notry to be a photograps that can use with all that data, and I can use that measure that that measure that metaphor, that metapprophotos of the vice of this phods, and creating of ws of the societabilities of the ocial devare.
And of course, it's product to this is the basically wonderful of every interesting every interesting every interesting place on Earth, which is not just from airtures, and other photos, and other photos, and other photos of the coluction, but also found the colcution.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to be a good possible that is possible of the next years, in the next years, all the before everybody can be in the world that are being in the world can be power popefull?
BA: Yeah. What this really is design.
The creates creates to you, hyperlinks between early between ears.
And it doing that on the basis of the data in the picture of data in the picture of data in the picture of data in the picians.
