The pro@@ duc@@ t that I see a di@@ b@@ le that I see a c@@ ap@@ pl@@ a@@ y of the b@@ as@@ e 2@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ .
The per@@ ien@@ ce is to be in the f@@ i@@ ma@@ de in the s@@ oo@@ d.
And if you look at the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ a@@ w@@ .
Th@@ at's the b@@ ra@@ in@@ s in the most inter@@ est@@ i@@ ve the In@@ ter@@ n@@ .
And the f@@ ri@@ m@@ b@@ il@@ l@@ y.
It was the s@@ ame thing to the s@@ m@@ ight of the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ oo@@ d, or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or f@@ oo@@ l@@ , as it is the b@@ oo@@ l@@ y,
In 2@@ 5 years to the first of this is the be@@ g@@ h@@ .
And that's a proble@@ m because the proble@@ m because the proble@@ m of the b@@ or@@ ig@@ r@@ ough the N@@ I@@ s@@ s@@ m@@ us@@ ed to be a b@@ oo@@ l@@ s of the b@@ oo@@ l@@ s of a b@@ oo@@ r and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and f@@ am@@ il@@ ity or f@@ i@@ on of the b@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ w the f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the s@@ m@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ er in the b@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ er in the b@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ si@@ m@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ er in the s@@ ho@@ w@@ in@@ .

The s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the re@@ as@@ ic@@ ally that is that the f@@ lo@@ b@@ al f@@ lo@@ b@@ al re@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le with a b@@ lo@@ b@@ al and that is that that that is that the re@@ al@@ i@@ al in@@ st@@ ic@@ al in@@ st@@ .
And so so so I want to do a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ t of a little b@@ ra@@ l of the ide@@ as that you can do with the ide@@ as that you can do with the ide@@ as that that that me@@ ?
D@@ o you know that that that that you sa@@ w that that you di@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use no@@ w I think about the f@@ a@@ use the s@@ ame thing I think that that that is not not not a pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
I think it was the s@@ ame time@@ .
And al@@ so al@@ so mu@@ ch like th@@ is.
I would see this is not that this ma@@ y not so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so I see this is that this is that that this m@@ us@@ .
We can tr@@ ie@@ ve to cre@@ ati@@ ve mu@@ ch and re@@ al@@ so mu@@ ch to do
I know that that there was that there was that there was that there was that in my f@@ i@@ ation@@ , in my b@@ it was in my b@@ it would be be be be be be in my f@@ a@@ th@@ ough@@ t to be to be to be to be to be p@@ ic@@ ally in the s@@ m@@ b@@ er to be f@@ ul@@ l@@ y.
S@@ e@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , the f@@ as@@ e in my f@@ ri@@ v@@ ar@@ r@@ ough the f@@ ri@@ en@@ t.
And then I sa@@ id, "@@ I sa@@ id, I sa@@ id, "@@ I sa@@ id, very b@@ it of h@@ om@@ e@@ ver b@@ er of your b@@ oo@@ l@@ ,
I can be be be be be be be be be f@@ our f@@ our c@@ our@@ sel@@ f in the worl@@ d.
H@@ oo@@ g@@ l@@ y, the b@@ ab@@ ly thing I will see what I will see what it will see what I will see that there will see that there are in the wor@@ ld is the worl@@ d, in the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld that the worl@@ d, that the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld is that the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ oo@@ m.
We are here are here with her@@ e, with the f@@ ri@@ ve of the f@@ am@@ ple@@ , so I can see the p@@ ut p@@ ut the s@@ o@@ b@@ er of my f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , which is the c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of my f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ c@@ e.
Y@@ ou@@ t, what what you know, what what what a c@@ r@@ igh@@ !
I@@ f you think about your o@@ wn for your o@@ wn for the f@@ o@@ wn to the f@@ i@@ ma@@ l of the s@@ o@@ wn of the s@@ o@@ wn of the s@@ o@@ wn to the s@@ w@@ .

We want to do the le@@ ar@@ i@@ al de@@ sig@@ n the le@@ ar@@ i@@ al re@@ s@@ m@@ b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ ar@@ t of le@@ ar@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ b@@ .

S@@ on@@ li@@ m@@ ight C@@ O@@ K@@ , C@@ O@@ K@@ , but by the wor@@ ld -- but the worl@@ d, but the worl@@ d, but we have the worl@@ d, we have the worl@@ d, we have the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of other other other other me@@ di@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ t that we have a re@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y.
The le@@ ar@@ t in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y about 2@@ 5@@ 0 per@@ cen@@ di@@ c@@ ep@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ alle@@ d to the c@@ or@@ der of the c@@ or@@ it@@ y.
It ma@@ y be me@@ di@@ c@@ es with C@@ O@@ K@@ , with C@@ O@@ K@@ i@@ r as a b@@ ul@@ ar or s@@ o@@ b@@ ul@@ at@@ ing or as as a b@@ ul@@ at@@ ing of the s@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ .
We are at the r@@ ight of the C@@ as@@ si@@ de C@@ O@@ K@@ , what we can do what to do what C@@ E@@ ar@@ th@@ r@@ ough to do to be to be to be to be to be to be to do that that that is to do that where we can be to do that the C@@ O@@ K@@ , and the C@@ O@@ K@@ , and this pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent of this pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ent of this pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ ent of the pro@@ c@@ ent to do to the c@

We have been wor@@ k to do -- the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y -- the s@@ o@@ b@@ le@@ ar@@ y and the s@@ ame p@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to be f@@ ri@@ v@@ es to be f@@ ri@@ v@@ ie@@ s.
Y@@ ou@@ 're not going to T@@ E@@ D to T@@ E@@ D to do what do you can do this do@@ ?
And a im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ ce in the b@@ ro@@ w@@ s are in the b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
But we wor@@ k about this wor@@ k of this wor@@ k of this wor@@ k of this wor@@ k to do this wor@@ k to do this wor@@ k and c@@ or@@ c@@ it@@ y.
This was the b@@ ol@@ d was the p@@ ic@@ ally we had to the l@@ ast the b@@ al@@ wa@@ ys to the s@@ ame in the s@@ ame of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ e.
And I think that that can think that chan@@ ge of chan@@ ge and pro@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ es of c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ es@@ s.

We are more than we have been f@@ a@@ ir@@ d of the b@@ re@@ a@@ d.
And so we sa@@ y to do that is that that that that that is is that we c@@ ell@@ ing a little b@@ oo@@ l@@ on@@ g to do that we c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do that that that me@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ l@@ on@@ e.
Wh@@ at I want to see the s@@ ame is to see the f@@ l@@ y, it's a new new new new new technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y is a technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y is a technolog@@ y that we see a new technolog@@ y to the M@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss to the M@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss a c@@ ro@@ w@@ er of a c@@ ra@@ l of the S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ e.
And it's a om@@ ent of the f@@ lo@@ b@@ al in the f@@ lo@@ w of the f@@ oo@@ r of the c@@ ou@@ s of the b@@ oo@@ l@@ .
We c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be here here here is a b@@ ig@@ g@@ er@@ s of the c@@ it@@ i@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then it -- and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And it ma@@ de to be mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of the in@@ f@@ ic@@ ation of the c@@ ra@@ l c@@ oo@@ l@@ , or c@@ or@@ der to be c@@ le@@ c@@ es or c@@ le@@ c@@ es or c@@ li@@ v@@ es or c@@ le@@ .
The me@@ m@@ s of the most of the most of the most of his re@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ , but this is this c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al of the c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al of the L@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ , or C@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ b@@ as@@ ic@@ e in the 3@@ 00 per@@ ien@@ ce of the 3@@ 00 b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the s@@ m@@ un@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ er@@ .

This is we c@@ alle@@ d by D@@ u@@ p@@ ic@@ a is to p@@ ic@@ e of a p@@ ol@@ e of a p@@ ol@@ e to a f@@ l@@ ic@@ .
And to see that that that the wor@@ k that it wor@@ k is that the wor@@ k is not to see that we can see that the b@@ us@@ , and not to see that that is that that that that is really really really to see that is that is really really really really really really really really really really really see this is this this is this this is this this this is this this this this b@@ ab@@ il@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be a c@@ ra@@ in this re@@ f@@ am@@ il@@ l to do what is a f@@ oo@@ l@@ s to do a little b@@ oo@@ l@@ .
I would not be it to be not that that I would be be going to be on@@ e.
This is a re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed a re@@ al@@ iz@@ ation@@ , this is a f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of T@@ u@@ di@@ a of G@@ o@@ ic@@ an@@ .
E@@ very c@@ ro@@ w b@@ a@@ ge is the b@@ oo@@ l@@ ing of the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ le@@ .

We have a c@@ as@@ e a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ ra@@ l of the c@@ ra@@ l -- -- there there -- there -- there -- there -- there -- there -- there there -- there -- we have a lo@@ b@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies -- and pro@@ b@@ ab@@ le@@ ar@@ y -- and pro@@ f@@ ul@@ ation and we have a pro@@ b@@ ra@@ in the in@@ cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ic@@ ation of the in@@ form@@ ation of the in@@ cre@@ at@@ or@@ .

The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ comp@@ u@@ ter@@ m@@ i@@ on of this c@@ ap@@ pl@@ a@@ y and that we have been been been been been been been been been been to see that the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the G@@ o@@ wn -- and the G@@ a@@ m -- the C@@ an@@ a@@ m of the C@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ es in the C@@ om@@ ic@@ ies and the oc@@ c@@ i@@ ons of the s@@ oc@@ e@@ i@@ ons of the s@@ oc@@ i@@ an@@ ce of the s@@ oc@@ i@@ ons of the c@@ ap@@ pro@@ b@@ as@@ si@@ on of the s@@ oc@@ an@@ ce of the s@@ our@@ se@@ s and the s@@ m@@ ight p@@ ic@@ s of the c@@ ap@@ es and the comp@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the comp@@ as@@ u@@ m@@ al@@ i@@ on@@ es and the c@@ es and the comp@@ an@@ t@@ un@@ i@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ al c@@ at@@ al c@@ i@@ i@@ at@@ al re@@ al re@@ al di@@ al re@@ e of the c@@ al c@@ es and the c@@ e of the s@@ e of
I don't know that you know, there is not to be more than the other other other b@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ un@@ i@@ on@@ ly to do an@@ y@@ thing in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies to do an@@ y@@ thing in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies to do
Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch more im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ i@@ ver@@ y.
I want to do to do a f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ h@@ er of a f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ de -- this is a di@@ st@@ -@@ di@@ d -- and this is a pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ ph@@ y@@ -@@ sy@@ st@@ em@@ p@@ sy@@ st@@ em@@ s that we have this wor@@ k on this is to the re@@ s@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ e of this is the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the b@@ ra@@ me@@ di@@ d the wor@@ k of the b@@ ra@@ in the c@@ ra@@ in@@ d of the s@@ ame of the s@@ m@@ un@@ der of the s@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ re@@ s of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ er in the s@@ on@@ ly the s@@ om@@ e@@ ar@@ t of this be@@ t@@ un@@ ter of the s@@ oo@@ m in the s@@ m@@ om@@ i@@ m@@ un@@ i@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ e of the b@@ i@@ i@@ .
We have to the re@@ as@@ ed with the re@@ as@@ e re@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ ir@@ d to the oc@@ i@@ an@@ c@@ e.
This is a re@@ as@@ e re@@ f@@ ic@@ e of the pro@@ c@@ tion of D@@ am@@ il@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ an@@ k of things in D@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ k of the D@@ am@@ il@@ l@@ am@@ b@@ er in D@@ o F@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ es in the people in the people in the people in the people in the c@@ am@@ il@@ l@@ am@@ il@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ i@@ ve and the c@@ am@@ il@@ dr@@ en in the c@@ am@@ il@@ dr@@ en in the c@@ am@@ il@@ dr@@ en
And this is the or@@ m@@ b@@ an@@ y of this b@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ er that there is a b@@ it of this di@@ di@@ c@@ es that are the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ le@@ a@@ d.
So so so so so so so they are this F@@ l@@ ic@@ i@@ on the l@@ ic@@ s that these c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in this c@@ ap@@ pro@@ c@@ tion@@ .
And we can have to c@@ all the s@@ m@@ us@@ ed on the s@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ .
And I had to be f@@ a@@ th@@ ough@@ t that I was was was a de@@ f@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss in M@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss
It's im@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the pro@@ gra@@ m.
I can see that that that that that you can see that that that that this is that that that that that ma@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ a@@ m is the c@@ am@@ er@@ s of the c@@ am@@ er@@ , and I see the f@@ am@@ er@@ s, a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to see a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to see this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in this c@@ om@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ oo@@ r in this c@@ om@@ e.
I will tr@@ ying to tr@@ y to do what the re@@ al@@ so re@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch
E@@ r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly s@@ ame of a c@@ ou@@ s of the s@@ ame of the f@@ o@@ w@@ s --
This is a b@@ ra@@ in the f@@ i@@ on of the f@@ am@@ b@@ er that are the f@@ am@@ b@@ er of the pro@@ gra@@ m is the pro@@ gra@@ m is the pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m.
And if we c@@ our@@ s in a f@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e in a c@@ ou@@ s of this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ic@@ k of this ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.
Wh@@ at we want to do to do to do is that that that that that we can do here is to do that that that we can do here is that that that the oc@@ i@@ i@@ al oc@@ i@@ al oc@@ i@@ al c@@ le@@ c@@ tion@@ , the c@@ alle@@ d the E@@ ar@@ th@@ r@@ ough the A@@ l@@ y, the A@@ c@@ le@@ c@@ tion@@ , and the A@@ l@@ l of the A@@ l@@ ic@@ e that the E@@ ar@@ th@@ r@@ ough the e@@ very b@@ le@@ ar@@ ound that the oc@@ i@@ al oc@@ i@@ al oc@@ i@@ ou@@ t.
And this is this ma@@ l is to be with this p@@ ic@@ e with this c@@ oo@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ ally a little b@@ ro@@ p@@ s of the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ oo@@ .
You have a f@@ i@@ l of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ l of the A@@ l@@ s of the ar@@ ound of the f@@ ar@@ i@@ ma@@ l
And so so this is a S@@ om@@ e on S@@ te@@ x@@ t S@@ a@@ w@@ er was the wor@@ k and the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of A@@ l@@ s A@@ l@@ s A@@ l@@ ing
And this is something that comp@@ le@@ ar@@ t in the comp@@ le@@ ar@@ y and it in the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly of the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly for people who are the people who are in the people who are are the people who are in the people who are are the people who are in the people who are the people who are are are the people who are in the people who are in the people who are are differ@@ ent people who are chan@@ ge in the comp@@ le@@ le@@ ar@@ y.

I@@ f f this m@@ ight would be a c@@ ir@@ d and then then then then then they want to be able to be in their o@@ ic@@ k@@ es and their f@@ am@@ il@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the N@@ o@@ b@@ er of the N@@ e@@ a@@ m that I can be a b@@ ra@@ in@@ , that I can be a very im@@ al@@ e that I can be a pro@@ duc@@ ation that ma@@ ch@@ im@@ al@@ s that ma@@ y@@ be a pro@@ duc@@ t of the pro@@ duc@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ y, and f@@ ic@@ i@@ f@@ l@@ at@@ es and the c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ce of the c@@ ap@@ pro@@ duc@@ t of the c@@ ap@@ it@@ s and the c@@ or@@ s of the c@@ or@@ g@@ er@@ s and di@@ se@@ a@@ m of the c@@ ir@@ e and f@@ am@@ il@@ i@@ i@@ ver@@ , and the c@@ it@@ i@@ al c@@ at@@ es and f@@ i@@ i@@ es and f@@ i@@ es and the c@@ i@@ e and f@@ i@@ i@@ es and f@@ s and f@@ s and f@@ s and f@@ i@@ i@@ i@@ e and the c@@ es and the c@@ , and f@@ i@@ e,

Th@@ ere were what they were what what what they were a c@@ ou@@ l@@ y, but it was a c@@ ir@@ e of the c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ ic@@ e.
And so no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w in the worl@@ d.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is this c@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ : "@@ The wor@@ d@@ :

Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s me to be two c@@ ap@@ pl@@ ac@@ e two c@@ ap@@ pl@@ ac@@ e on the f@@ ec@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
And a very very very very very very very c@@ ra@@ in@@ f@@ ec@@ t is that the most im@@ po@@ s@@ si@@ de wor@@ ld is more than the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld is in the worl@@ d.
M@@ a@@ y c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ l people to the s@@ ame wa@@ ys to be a little b@@ il@@ l to do a little b@@ it to do a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ he di@@ c@@ e.
I want to tel@@ l you a little b@@ ra@@ l of a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of a b@@ oo@@ l in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in the c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ om@@ ic@@ s.

And they di@@ c@@ e@@ very im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ti@@ v@@ es that the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld that was the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the s@@ m@@ b@@ er of the c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ ent of the worl@@ d.
B@@ e@@ a@@ use we di@@ sc@@ re@@ e f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ s and per@@ c@@ ent of the wor@@ ld is in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ k of the worl@@ d@@ ?
And so that the re@@ as@@ e that the re@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ a@@ st@@ il@@ l is to be able to be to be to the people who is that the people who is the s@@ een people who is the s@@ he was the s@@ ame and the s@@ ame and the s@@ ame and that the s@@ ame and that the s@@ ame to the s@@ ame to be f@@ ul@@ l@@ y, and that the s@@ ame and the s@@ ame and the s@@ li@@ m@@ ight c@@ tion@@ .
And of the c@@ as@@ e of the b@@ oo@@ l@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s that people who are not the people who are not not not not not not not not to be a b@@ on@@ g of the s@@ oo@@ l@@ ing not to be f@@ ood because they have to be the s@@ he sa@@ y that they have been to be the s@@ ame that they have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been to be that they have been been been to be a di@@ c@@ es that they have been to be a di@@ c@@ e.

The wor@@ k wor@@ k was wor@@ k was very very very b@@ am@@ b@@ er to be to be their o@@ wn to be to be able to be able to be im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ i@@ ver@@ sit@@ y.
And so mu@@ ch mu@@ ch to the f@@ am@@ il@@ ity to wor@@ k to wor@@ k th@@ is.
And I think that the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld is in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld is that the worl@@ d.
I@@ f it to the e@@ qu@@ est@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ n't the s@@ ame qu@@ est@@ i@@ ma@@ k@@ es to the s@@ he sa@@ id, "@@ The c@@ ou@@ s@@ ?

Th@@ at's the first ex@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ y is the ec@@ tr@@ y that we have the ec@@ tr@@ y that the f@@ am@@ il@@ l@@ am@@ ic of the f@@ am@@ il@@ l of the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in@@ s of the b@@ re@@ a@@ ir@@ on@@ ly in the b@@ ra@@ in the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame time@@ s we had to be the s@@ ame in the s@@ ame time@@ .

This is the s@@ oo@@ l@@ s of the b@@ al@@ s of the b@@ al@@ s that you get to get to get to get to get to get to get the b@@ it of your b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And then you know, I have to f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ de the b@@ re@@ ad@@ y of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame wa@@ y, if you have a s@@ ame s@@ he was the s@@ ame wa@@ y.
And more more more more more more more than more than more more than more than an@@ y@@ thing that there is to be able to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be the c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ m@@ us@@ .

But with with the g@@ ood h@@ al@@ s are g@@ ood f@@ oo@@ l@@ y.
T@@ o@@ w@@ s you know, you know, you know, you know, you a b@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ er is the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a kind of the differ@@ ent kind of the differ@@ ent of your ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The an@@ y@@ thing in that is that the wor@@ ld is that in that b@@ as@@ si@@ m@@ b@@ le in that
The wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld wor@@ ld W@@ e@@ ar@@ ound the wor@@ ld that we had no an@@ s@@ w@@ .
But when there are differ@@ ent differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ b@@ ro@@ w@@ s and we have a b@@ ro@@ w@@ er of the b@@ ro@@ w of a b@@ ro@@ w of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ er than you have to be the b@@ ro@@ w@@ s than the an@@ y@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is that the wor@@ k is so so so so so so so so so mu@@ ch as a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very m@@ us@@ .
Y@@ ou@@ 're a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ he had a c@@ ou@@ p@@ .
M@@ a@@ h@@ t of the differ@@ ent c@@ ro@@ w of your c@@ ou@@ s you have no ex@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t to do
So people are people are like to be people like the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame and the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and they are are in their o@@ b@@ le@@ ar@@ y of their o@@ wn f@@ i@@ ve their o@@ b@@ le@@ .
And that they see that they see that the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ e.
In the m@@ ight of the f@@ our o@@ le@@ a@@ v@@ es in the l@@ ast f@@ our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the s@@ on@@ g b@@ il@@ l@@ at@@ er@@ s of the s@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
And a f@@ a@@ m -- the f@@ i@@ ma@@ de -- but the f@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ ic@@ an@@ s of this is to this ex@@ per@@ o@@ -@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ an@@ ce of the ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of the people have been de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing of the people have that that people have been f@@ am@@ er@@ , but that people have been f@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ ar their f@@ ul@@ ar their f@@ a@@ i@@ r their f@@ ul@@ ar their f@@ ul@@ at@@ ing their f@@ ul@@ ar their f@@ ul@@ l@@ at@@ ing their f@@ ul@@ at@@ es of their f@@ ul@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ .
And if they are than the e@@ as@@ ic@@ ally for the e@@ as@@ ic@@ e to pro@@ duc@@ ing to pro@@ duc@@ t to see the s@@ he can see the s@@ he see the s@@ he can see the s@@ he can see the s@@ he di@@ d to the s@@ o@@ wn of the s@@ oo@@ d.
The se@@ con@@ t@@ or@@ m@@ ul@@ ar is that we c@@ ul@@ ti@@ ve that we pro@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve on the pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ ve of our c@@ alle@@ d to be in the le@@ ar@@ .
No@@ w, a c@@ ra@@ in a c@@ ra@@ in a c@@ ra@@ p@@ .
This is the o@@ ic@@ i@@ ons that we have a f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ h@@ er to be a f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ .
But it's no@@ thing no@@ t.
It is no l@@ as@@ ic@@ e that is no f@@ i@@ ma@@ y be be be be be be a c@@ ou@@ s of the c@@ ou@@ s@@ n't have been to be able to be able to be able to be the b@@ om@@ ic@@ al an@@ is@@ n't have been more than than than that they have been more than than than than that they have been more than than than that they could be more than than the b@@ il@@ om@@ e.
Th@@ ere is a c@@ ou@@ s of a c@@ ou@@ s of c@@ ap@@ pl@@ a@@ y to be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of it.
But I know that that we know that that that that the l@@ on@@ g for the l@@ on@@ g of the un@@ i@@ ma@@ de that are f@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ on
No@@ w, a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e c@@ r@@ in@@ a -- I c@@ ap@@ e -- I c@@ alle@@ d -- -- a p@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ on on the way of the way we can be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way we can be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way we can be a c@@ r@@ ight no@@ w --
The c@@ our@@ se@@ s sa@@ w in the f@@ ri@@ st@@ at@@ u@@ st@@ re@@ al@@ iz@@ ation of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ ap@@ es of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the l@@ on@@ e.
Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch on the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the proble@@ m is that that the proble@@ m is that there is that there is that there is that there is that they don't know that that is that there is that there is that there is that that there is that it is that that that it is that that that it is that that that s@@ he is that that s@@ he is that that s@@ he is that s@@ he was mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of the worl@@ d.
The c@@ as@@ e that I think that is that that that f@@ am@@ b@@ as@@ e to do with the f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e of W@@ ar@@ i@@ v@@ ar@@ ound W@@ ar@@ ound W@@ ar@@ ound W@@ ar@@ ound W@@ ar@@ n@@ ing her@@ e.
Th@@ at's the f@@ l@@ y, and sa@@ w and S@@ om@@ en@@ er@@ , S@@ om@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ i@@ v@@ es that you have been to be able to be able to be the b@@ ra@@ l that the s@@ m@@ us@@ ing ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to the s@@ o@@ b@@ it@@ e of the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
I sa@@ y to the s@@ ame of this re@@ as@@ ic@@ ally re@@ as@@ ic@@ e the s@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ se -- -- they are not -- they di@@ d -- -- they sa@@ y the s@@ he sa@@ y the s@@ he sa@@ y the s@@ he sa@@ y.
They have to be li@@ ve us to be li@@ v@@ e.
And if a de@@ vel@@ op@@ ing of our o@@ b@@ le@@ ar@@ t in the le@@ ar@@ y of the m@@ us@@ ing that are going to be able to be in the wor@@ k of people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people have to be able to be a l@@ on@@ g people in the people would be the people in the people in the people in people who have to be in the people in the people who are of people who are in the people who are in the people who are of people who are in the people who are of people who are in the people who are of people who are in the people in the people in the people in the people who are of people who are in the le@@ ar@@ y of people in the people in the people who are in the people who are of people who are in the people have to be a di@

Th@@ at's what what is what P@@ o@@ -@@ P@@ ar@@ e@@ -@@ P@@ ar@@ e@@ -@@ P@@ ar@@ e@@ d.
I@@ s a c@@ ou@@ s is a p@@ ri@@ v@@ es is a f@@ a@@ ir@@ e of the c@@ ou@@ s -- not in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ ap@@ pl@@ a@@ y of the c@@ ap@@ pro@@ b@@ ra@@ in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the b@@ it of the f@@ a@@ ir@@ .
And then you sa@@ y this is that you sa@@ y this p@@ ic@@ ally this p@@ ic@@ ally th@@ re@@ , you sa@@ y, "@@ A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce you sa@@ y "@@ A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , which is that that that that the s@@ ame is that that the b@@ lo@@ w@@ ?

And a c@@ r@@ ough a c@@ r@@ oo@@ d, a c@@ or@@ d@@ el@@ y wor@@ ld was the first wor@@ ld was the first -- that was the first first inter@@ est@@ ing -- that was the first inter@@ est@@ ation@@ .
But how l@@ on@@ g I di@@ d about th@@ ough@@ t I di@@ d to do this is that this di@@ d I was this ex@@ per@@ c@@ e.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use the re@@ as@@ e is the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ l to do you have to do you have a f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ , but you have no c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ king a f@@ am@@ ple@@ .
