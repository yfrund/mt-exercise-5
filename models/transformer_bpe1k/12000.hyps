And I show this two dia's last year I see this two dia's police cap, who the last three million years of years of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem because the requipe problem because it didn't the dict of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice is the North Pole, in a certain is a certain of our global heart system.
It looks in the winter and critors in the summer and critor.
The next dia that I showed is a version of what the last 25 is happened 25 is happened 25 is happened 25 is happened 25 years.
The permanent is to understand in rood.
As you seee, it looks at dark to dark it from dark blue.
That's the years, that is the year, in the equire.
And it crack in the summer in the summer
And the same permanent ice, five years or five years or is like the body is like blood as blood, that from the body is like the body is here.
In 25 years is the way of this is going to be in this forward.
And that's a problem because the free of the North particular IJessaa sea and there, and there is a very great amount of a very great amount of cool, when it design, when it designed in methrough mom, when it gets in methane.
And so, with the total hundance, in the atmosphere, that could be early expect in the atmosphere, if we can realized the count of the atmosphere.
In some understand in Alaska borrelt methane on the water of the water.
And African winter Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team with another team to another understand,
Whoo! We! OK. The question is we will be be that will be be.
A reason is that this enormous "warming Groenland from Groenland from the normous of the noordous of the noormous of warming.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than ever is real than ever beyond than ever before the water than ever before.
This is the Kangerlusual suagest-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea country because it's landics because it lands in the sea place where it is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea where it comes in the sea where it comes in the sea of the sea countries.
This stromations are taking away flightly away.
On the other side of the planet, on the South polic, the largest ice mass the largest ice mass the Earth.
And African area cientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice in a negative ice balance.
More specific is in the ice of the South pool of the South police of the South pool of the South purposes of the South purpose.
The whole continent is for six meters for six meter, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the two after icro, there are new now, there are new now, who are new now, that are new now,
40 percent of the world's population is going to be the half of his dress of that smell time.
In the Andes, is this glass the bron of drinkwater for this city.
There are more stromes.
But when they disappearing the dress water.
In California was there was a four-40 percent in the snows of the Sierra.
It's comes back in the water reservices.
And as you could read the predictions are nastiguous nstiguous read.
This worldwing three dream has shiped to a drammatic styce.
And the number of natural around the world is called the world, with a incredible and never seen the speed.
For more in the last 30 years ago in the last 30 years of the last 75 years.
This pattern is full increating this.
If you look at the way from a historical context than you see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 24 hours of CO2 fours --
25 mios tonce in our ocean, in our oceans, and look at the eye of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, and every single of the Indian instance, there is a drag, there is a drager in the ocean.
The only big causes of the Earth, nast, name out of the Earth, which is 20 percent of the Earth, is the fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and it's all the great problem, it's all the largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extinited the two largest stoters,
And there was a proposle to build a lot of more still centrals.
But we see a member.
These are the citual clast centrales that was the built of the built of the last years, and where green alternative alternative alternatives and where are alternatives in the last years.
There is real a political strized in our longs in our lond.
The steengineering -- and oil-industry for 250 million dollars from a dollars to promots, which is a cool of promots, which is a genstice --
And that picture to think about something like this.
And the core was in Tennesse, at me in Tennesse, about four billion liter classessary of money
You probably in the news in the news of the news in the news.
This is the one after one after one after the last last last distream,
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the coose of the cities, the Kerst distrive was three was three was thing.
Video: "Frosty the stepple man is a blice, a blice, right?
He is overfluence here in America, and he sare here in America, and he she's going to be economy.
Frosty the cite guy is that with the day of the day
He is better and cratty and works, and works."
Here is a big comes a big of the stepper in West Virginia from the cool in West Virginia from the city.
The great least mality is the great is the great of Massey Coal.
Video: Dononly Blankship said, "Let me be clearly -- Done, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about that."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
And Vo "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our things for our things
That's why the reason why it's the most important to give a gigantic of the wraking for the light for the light of the light of the truth of value of the truth of value that is the truth of the value of the value of the value is the light of the li
Feity, is not sal.
We think it's a soon -- and it's just a -- and it's still leave ever --
So, you don't make a climate change.
Let me go to our govern.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern modern cooling cool central central.
Fantastic! The machines make what the machines are what what law.
But that's the sound of sound sound of sound sound technology.
And the fact that it's the fact that it's furres of the most important thing of the most important thing of the Earth is change of the Earth is change the remarkable of the Earth is that you see here.
Look at right, this is the schone of the day.
Al Gore: Eintually put the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that are on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America very, the economy, the economy, the national secrisis.
The rod red reason of these things is our dependent of phot phot of photograph, as fires and put inmported oils and put inmported oil.
But now is a durful, new solution to get here,
And in the same America of 100 percent scape electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to get a plan that our safe that our security of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
Einvitue that is a solution that is to solve our problems to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontly,
Al Gore: And the last this.
Video: Stem: It's going to be America to give America to give America and energy.
One of the fastest ways to make a single of our planet to our planet of olded fuel of old to our planet to help.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: New 2: New w to create good to create good jobs to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tich, to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is a old African speaks, "If you want to be all fast.
If you want to go away, again,
We need to go and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I returned back with a hold about how that machine works.
So here's now, I did to the LHC is not the LHC is the great scientific experiment experiment in 27 miment in 27 kilometers in the mounce.
It has to be the subject of the universe, which was less than a billion than a billion done universe to 600 million times a second of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition!
This is the machine under Geneds.
We took photographs of that leig Big Big Bangs in detectors of the teach, and this is the one where I work. It is the ATLAStor -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And in 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was genomes by ATLAS.
That is a party for a party in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that are around the LHC and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and the D, which is particles.
In other words, when we photograph to 10 September wouldn't wind that the machine works, which is a huge government.
I don't know if this is the greatest thing that is the greatest right now, if somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page, and saw the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these gold with these gold before walked with these gold before
And they were reasons of 13 thousand amples when the machine on the follower on the full power on the full power on thousand amples when the machine on the follows of thousand amples of the power on the power on to the full power on the follows on the full power.
The engineers under you will say, "No true. It's true. It's to small th."
They can do that because they can do that superps on wholed at the whole lature temperature of the last temperature of the last longer last temperature
So on myth, 271 grad, then the good between the girls, that can drager between the stream of the gards.
In one of the next between thousand magnets in the LHC, zat a constructive.
And that was the wirely of something warmer, and there was one electrical weather to get 13 thousand amples that 13 thousand amps of thousand ample of the 13 thousand ample of the wirelectric weavail,
This was the result.
This is another inpressive if you realized that that magnets more than 20 tones 20 tones are about 30 centimeter of the way and they were about 30 centimeter.
We described about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of them, what we did out of it.
We all have them when we all have parated.
Now they're back on away.
Eind might be the LHC weather is going to be the LHC weather intact.
We will be able to put him and we expect him in you, and we can expect to be able to go with the explain the figurther than the building of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who are unhappening to the value of scientific research of scientific research of science.
I think it's so difficult that it's so difficult that we go to be further than ever the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English science Humphrey Davy, I was the device, I was reded experiments of his learning experiments of his learned -- his learning was Michael Farday, this is so dangerous of the human being is so we have our science that our science of human beings that our science our beyond to be that in the physics of the physics that our completely of the way that our compleave and we we diaturbassions,
Thank you very much.
I would want to start to ask with you to get back to your kids back to your kids, when you play with blocks.
When you discovered to understand how to go to figure out and they rescue, you know, you actually have to learn with the surface of space and hunters of space and hunters of space.
Rutell insight is stronger because of the world, because of the world.
If a inspired by the name of physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- sames, with my advise Pattion and my mework Jee Kalanithi -- what if we use -- what if we use -- what if we use -- what if we use -- what if we use a computer mouse to a computer mous as a kind of increase that we can put to a place that we can informed on a little bit of information and we can put in a piece that we can information with a little bit with a little bit of inforce of information and we can pigiousult of information and ence of instance and sular interact of ined on a fult of the movities of fult of funitionate a ship of the pignitive of phy-base
and can make orders like we want to let right?
This is what we ask us to look at this is that we decided to look at a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Siftype is a Siftly a Sift-fluence of a cookies.
They can be able to put them up with the hand they can be fell to feel their movement and they fave them a screen and small contact.
The nuclear is the physical handled is the physical handled by understand through it in the purpose.
Bovenualize his Siftables a new ecosystem for the way, of a new ecosystem for way,
That these hole is a more physical different of a physical different of their movement and of their movement and even of the way we move and even of the way we move them a different new new and leave new leave and we are different new leak of interactions and learning new legs,
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sift is instimagined to show to show to show to can, and others and others and others and others and others and others played and other.
This interactive portraits are of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will be interesting for each other.
When they are going to be reality, they can be able to be what to be become a little bit and what can be become a little bit and what can be support to be able to be able to be the and what what they can be sure.
And they feel movement and they move and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interesting interaction, the usual bars of the interaction, as it was a small of a color as it was a small of a little bit of a little fluence of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction,
In this example three Siftables of Siftables for and I can use them to go into a leave in a leg of a leg in a leg of hordind.
If we gotten save what we remember, we go back to what what it back.
There are some capple of course possibilities for the education, and the same thing with language, and logics that we want to give people the possibility to prove, and the result and the result of things that is to show.
And here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci through a simply programmmic.
And here we show this is a game that a cruishing between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in everyone wanted to be a wanted to get on every Siftable, and fly, and flated in a words.
After about 30 seconds it is that it really result, and different ent a new series of shearing possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am them to try them out out of the same out of this.
They were really realized from that.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people almost of these passion is that people are almost of the most interesting things of these instructions of the most interesting things of these aren't
Everything you have to say, "Make word," and they know exact" and they know what they need to do this.
And here are some other people on the other people on the straight now.
That's our young basically test, right?
And it seems to be the Siftables wood.
For him was just this blocks.
And here is a interactive painting a interactive painting.
We wanted to teach a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonster that demonster
And he can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftly, by the Siftacker of the table.
Here it is the sun comes up the sun come.
Video: The sun comes up there.
David Merrill: Now he has a tract in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed through th!
And though the suive of Siftables and the name ely can put the caracross the caracross -- Video: Wllet --
DM: and so his own story of them in the area.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decide how it it it is the walks.
Video: The cated.
DM: The last example I will show Is now Is a synthesizer and live music to be developed to develop a sound product that every Siftables a sound product and the lead, bases, and drumber and drum.
And every has four different variations that you can build to do you choose you want to use it with it.
This happiness, in a leave Siftables can be injected to be injected the pattern of the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern through the pattern of a leage Siftly, there are live controlled effects as reverbal efits and filter.
They are going to be able to sound and sound and sound through cancer and showed by can.
And farther the algements like tempo and volume that are pated on the whole pattern on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We're starting with a leave in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a first pattern by a extra lot of extra lot of extra lot of extra lot of extra extra extra lot of plad.
Now I place the basically real.
Video: DM: Dong I feed what I food.
Video: And I copple I cope the filter of the drums, so I can influt live to the effect live to influence.
Video: DM: I can get it very very very, I can get the cancer of the tempo block of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: DM: Now I put the movie for what more expression for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescued it pattern to the pattern of the play.
I don't have to do anything that I don't want to plann, but I can improviserate the longer and corter as I want.
With the dimmmmate of the fact Siftly Siftly Siftly.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from the new people, from new people, we can make human-interfaces that are better interfaces to the way our brain and bodies and work our brain and work and work and work and work and work and work to work our brain and work and work on the way to work is to make the way to work our brain the way we can make our b
And today I had the time to show you one of the same element in this designed in this designed with some possibilities that we are to develop in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is that this is just the same is that this is a very new generation to a very new generation for the Inters with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hear.
I look at out of you to talk to you with you all and talk to you to talk to you with you.
I'm writing awrite.
Books is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long for for for for for writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever change in the way.
And yet there is unless of something that happened in my life and career in my life and career with my work with my work to my work to my work to my work to your work and
And it started with a book that I wrote understand a memoving written a member, Biddle, Bit, Bible say, to my first first first of the world and international world about the International imagin.
The ready is that people are always of the whole and always I had to be able to be dam.
World where -- really,
People comes to me and ask to me and ask you and ask you know, "You don't you know, you don't never ever event?
You don't do you get to your whole you are going to be able to be a whole write more a book more a book that are people for warm where people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to warm and you write to be able to be a whole of the book that become a book more of the whole you are that they are you going to be able
You don't do that?"
Any distated, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Of course, that would be a very 20 years ago, I remember 20 years ago -- I was a teener -- if I was told that I wanted to be a teenad.
People said, "You don't you never get that you never have success?
You don't do to be able to rese, that you know, you researcheage?
You don't do that you get to your life to this work on this work without of this work without of the comes and you will have a lot of your broken on the puin your bitters of your bitters of falen?"
Something in that stread.
And in the short comes to the answer, my answered on that questions to the questions on that questions to the questions of my answer on that questions to the questions of my answer,
Yeah, I'm bang for all of those things that are called the things that are called
Always of it alway.
But I also much other things that is a lot of other things that all of it down.
For very single example, and other engineering things.
But what I ask writing to write myself where the last time that angst from.
Is it rational rational rational e?
Is it logically that somebody is going to be able to be able to work for the work for the work for their mention on Earth are set?
What is so much more to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the minds, something that is something like to work on the other species work is not happened to happening to happened.
And then my father. He was wonderful engine, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years who worked in the 40 years who was ever wondered to him there.
And so it said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, no, so it was not about this.
And to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be hold by the centuries of the century of manical depressive also manical reputation for piece of manical alcoliststs.
Schricright, which have one of reputation.
Not only anyway, other creative people have reputation to be the reputation human being instability.
Look at the grimble dodental dodental under the most magnifical creative spirit of the 20th century.
And many of young, failable young,
And even though that didn't even moorn place, under their gave swer their gave currened.
In the last interview for his done for his dad said Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailers."
That's what to say about your lives.
But of this kind of this kind of looking at the kind of looking at this.
We all have the first one of the fairly and have it comes to the sourcepted.
The hearned thought is that creativity is that creativity is understood is that a poor and that a artist-triendly will leave to be a poor of artist,
And I want to ask everyone here today is to ask with that idea of life that idea of living here to?
Do you know, you know, OK?
Now I think I think about it is a good about the whole I think about it is a pretty pretty though.
I think I think the weather way.
And also another dangerous.
I won't like to see this eight now this century.
We can creative spors much better to live better for life.
I know that it's a for me, in my situation, in my situation, for me, to be dangerous dangerous.
And it seeed the fase where my career in my career now is now
And it's just a little bit of young, amper right now is a little year.
I can maybe I can work four decades works.
And the way, is going to probably what I think now is going to be the outside world as it work as the world as it work on that extraordinary successful book.
We are here with friends on each other, so I can do it in the ways probably light my greatest success, my greatest success,
Jig, what a idea!
If you think if you think about the morning for you know, to the morning to the next to the drive on the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love to the work where I love with the work where I love with the work of like I love me.
The question is: "Hoo?"
After long after long after the conclusion that I can just go through to write a psychological described in the process.
I have to be during a safe a safe of a safe between myself and my government and my government for the responst for the responst of the futures.
I have the last year I went to ways that to do that.
I have a better history and have done in other societies to see if others to see if others a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative percent of the creative process.
My search has been braight to the old Gred Great and Romeins.
Let's just right, because it's a long and inplay story.
In the time of the old of the Gred and Romeins and Romeins people didn't have a hundred of themselves.
And we believed that creativity is a good particular was, who was a godngood place to human beings came to human reasons.
The Greeks of these necessary of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demp that went to influisterated in the way.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they are called a called creative creative creative spirit of a genious creative a "geniously encould."
The Romeins is that the Romeins is not a genion a genion of person on is a genion of person on is clearning in a genion of person is not a genion a genion is not a genion to a genion is not a genion a genion is that the Romeines without of a genion is that the next of a genion is that the genion a genion the moreines of the genion the entire not a genion the one is not a geny of the geny of the morein
In their polity, a genion was a kind of magical entitude in the mure of the atells of the atell-state state of the ately of the artist.
A bit like Dob, the house,
If the artist, the work was working on the work of the entire assistance.
And he shape shape shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's precise I had the first one, the psychological protection of your work.
Everyone knew how that in his work in his work in his work in his work
The articst in protection was so in the protection of example, to many narcism.
If you work to work up there, you did there, you did it all every eevery eat.
Everyone knew that is a may that a unshows you had heard to heard holps.
You know, you work you work on the way, you know, that not only on you.
Everyone makes you had a negal genion of genion genion of genion of genion of genious genious genious genious geniously enevery universe of the inhandicated.
Lange time is that had been creativity to the West creativity was being to protected
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change.
There is a very new idea: the individual humans is the individual human universe, and mysterious and mysterious and mysteries.
No space for mystical ress, ature of the goddary world.
That was the beginning of the rational house.
People believity that creativity is full from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first thing in history was there about artists artists said that they were a genion and they didn't have a genion that they had a genion that they had a genion that had a genion the history and they did a genion of the history that they had a genion that they had a genion artists that they had a genius and they had a genion around the history that they had a genius had a genion the genion the history and they had said that they had a genius that they had a genius and
I have to say that I have to say that a big figure out that I have to say that a big fail.
And to one person, one person, one person, one of individual, that he safe that he safe is the essentially is the essentially the euwer mystery, of everything that is a lot of what's good ddard, and it's something that is -- that's something that is to much a fral sych.
And, if you ask somebody asks in the sun slike.
Egos are blazes to gigantial proportunities and there are unimaginations, and there are universe expected to prestations of prestations and
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists capot has made a lot of artists capot has made a lot of artists capot of the last 500 years of artists capot that this drugs in the last 500 years of artists capot that this drugs has been made a lot of artists a lot of artists that this
If that is, and I think is the question is the question is, "What now what us?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back on a parently understand the creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years awner in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speed.
And in the audience of the audience people who who realed scientific developed scientific socus about the idea that elphysics of the fact of the work of artists of artists that work of artists that are burned to inspirit of the work of artists that are already of the work of artists that have to inspired the wor
It doesn't look at me that I will all be in that I will get to be in that.
And I ask it to me it it it it me walk me
Why not?
Why would we didn't have thought that thought that thought that thought of thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought of thought that thought that thought of thought that thought that would be thought to be thought that thought thought that thought thought that would we diddn't thought that thought
The basically is like a lot of highs as another dissions of the total makes that decided to the creative process.
Everyone that has to create something has to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, here -- you know, the creative process -- you know, the creative process --
That sometimes that sometimes the paranormmal.
I have unled the wonderful American directional Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone of Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of American director.
And she is close in the next of the next of them.
She told me about her jeught on the platated,
Somes, if they were working on the work was felt she was a close she was a close about the country.
It was, as as as as as as as as if there was a big golf air.
And it was close golphy than the country to her her.
They felt that the ground under her foot under her foot and well, and makes her on that moment but one thing one thing to do this:
They walk to house, back by the close and they had to set and they had to see paper and paper and paper and paper paper and paper
When it was close to her her her her engy was that her only to write it on the same to write it on the rite to write it on her engine.
Sometimes they didn't enough.
Then right, but it down, it's not.
And at the sult of schools schools and she sappeared by her words about the field, in her words -- to another directly -- to another directly --
And so it was a little bit of -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are the close of the story -- that they almost mic.
And then she was in home and paper and paper and paper and schools the close through her show.
Juist on that moment they had a potal than a potal to path.
And with her other hand, so told me she put it from the air.
They path, she picked up in his start, and then it back in her body in her body in her body in her body right.
In that cases came out of the close that in soccurred on paper in paper but then in the follower rated follow.
When I was heard that heard -- what I thought, I thought my creative process!
And so my creative process is not! I'm no medium! I'm no medium!
I'm a mouse mush, who was a mouse day on the same time, and sweet, and sweet, and sweet, and trans out of through being and trans a beyond stalk.
But even in that day sware that I have a experience I had a experience.
You will also be the way to do that there are creative ideas that there are creative ideas that there are creative to a bron from a bron that you can can be impossible of the bron you can can be impossible to you.
What is that than that is that for burn?
How can we use it without that without we are being at the heal?
On a way that is a way to us for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think is musicians Tom Waits.
A few years ago I was interviewed him for a time,
We had the thought of this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is life the showed of his life of the countary artists that from all the magins of the universe, to get up in the unexpensive impulse to this.
With the 1990s,
And in a day he was in Los Angeles about the speaway and changed it in the speaking radical.
And as he was so real, he was so ready he was a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that we've done that we've done understand the corbar,
It was a beautiful that and he wanted to be the fasthing.
But that won't wouldn't it.
He had no paper right now, no paper order at the time.
The well-familion is after weather again, "I went from the melowho are the melowho are following me back to me.
I don't am enough enough it way."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stop that whole mental process and did something news.
And he looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry heard you don't see that I behind the stuff I behind the stuff?"
"Do you really really want to write a song of son?
If you really want to get this lose to be later you have to get later if I have to do time.
And not, anyone else else else else.
And Ga neurbs at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Cohen."
The work itself is the same thing is the same dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark is the same thing.
But the sware except to the creative process of him in him in him in him when he distance.
It was to set him and she was just to the ssky and read it all of the sky.
And in the way, there was no realized to go through to go through to go through through to go through through to do that.
It could be a wonderful like, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own and the own and the own and the own of Tom myself to Tom myself to Tom myself to Tom itself to be a wonderful of T
That story that has changed my way of working on changed.
I had all realized on the real of the head.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle, Biddle, Bit,
And I give a moment in the speak of moment I wheel.
You know, you know, you know, you don't want to work and you think it's a different directly that it is a different directly becomes a different book.
Not simply bad bad, really dible of the bad bad.
I wanted to do it all the project of all of the project of all the project of all the project.
When I remember to be Tom that who are genion who who are genion who who are endly,
I wish me from my manuscrips and ridge me to a leave me, and I went to a leave of the room.
And I said hardop: "Lister, we know everything that if this book, we know that if this book, it's not just by me.
You can see I think I have all in the stop what I have.
And I can't give you a lot of that.
If you find that it better can, you have to do your mind.
Snap you don't do that? Do you don't do that, you're right?
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the note may be awing to be a different of cancer for today is different."
Tja--- Unity, it's comes on the nearly ...
Euws agos ago in the North African woostine people sample to dance at months to dance at the same music to dance in the North African
And then then they were back and figure out to the oglors.
That was always wonderful because the dances were full professionals.
But sometime, there was a little bit of this.
One of that dances bed thananscendent.
You know, you know, you know, what I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, one performer in a performer of a performer in a performer of this.
It was like the time still still and the dance through a poor,
He didn't, but nothing else than the thousands of night, but now fair.
And the pursue he didn't longer a human beings.
In him, under him, boy's him glood.
A godname, field,
If so done something that was happened to class people what Dan they started to cllass and in class and in class: "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By way, a leun historically historically this, Toen South Spange Spange Spange Spange Spange --
The real real is real real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, OK, ooone."
And that hused to the day today to still the day and flamengodances.
If a articst in Spanical thing or magically do or magically down, "Allah, oone, OK, ooon, oone, Allah, oone."
And understand -- sic: one glimp of God.
Preciiize what we need to have
Last, that the dance is that the dance morning morning to the morning morning to the morning of 11 hours and the morning is not good descened more than good ddangled more than good lads.
And in that moment is he wrong a what's going to be a little bit of the way that may have never more to be more more to such more to such more to such more more to such more more to be going to come up with a what's going to be a what's going to be a what's going to be a little bit more to be a what's going to be a little
Maybe there will never be more anyone of God at God at at the time.
What is to the rest of his life now of his life?
That's hard.
That's really difficult to put for a creative mind.
But so pinside it doesn't be able to be able to be so
Imagine you don't get to the most most of your person aspects of your person aspects of your person from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself.
And if you believe that you believe that you have a time to have a time, a which, of a didn't have a source.
When you get there to any one else with somebody else else, they give somebody else.
And so she considered ances everything.
I put infishing in the mind.
The last months I have a book that book that book, that is going to be different count of the book much where much more to read is to reach is going to expensive to is to the is that much more to be a book much of a book that much more to be different to be different to be a book that much more than a book that I have a lot of a book,
The opened of that illuster progress.
If my thought with me to the hold I love to me, I stral the same thing that We'll be able to be there.
That just your work.
And you just just do you do this, what it is.
If it is to dance, thank you thank you.
If the godness genion that you're decision to work on your work on one of the wonderful bron through to show you through the wonderful bron by the wonder, "Ol!"
And it happens not, thane than right?
And also than: "OK,"
I believe that I believe that is harted.
"Ol, how it ever we pure from pure human loved and own own and own to replace.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: OK!
You know, I had it to be a couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can meaning that can meaning new sets of genes.
We started to go to a new point, we were the biology of the digital and now try to the digital code of that digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology and synthetic of life.
So we tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions.
"What is something that is something that I think is something that have a lot of biologists have trying to understand on different level.
We have different benaders tried to minimed the back to minimal components.
We are now 20 years on the digitalization.
When we have sequence, we have sequenced, it went from the analog world, from the biology, to the digital world,
Now we try to ask to ask life, or we can regenerate new life, or we can create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the species for a kind of that can be human right in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can come to a nice smaller genome.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from 500 or 500 or so that we are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map is relatively that relative relative to the understand the onze.
Now, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all of the genes that we can look at the living is probably unliving cell that this is a living cell cell of life.
We decided to be able to put this chromospeed to this chromospling this chromospeed to synthetic so that we could depents the components to the most of the most of the most fundamental questions to stral this chromospeaking this chromospers.
And so we started with questions as we started to ask a chromoshe's a chromos?"
Stail the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never have never seen before we never seen before we never seen before this very great molecules that we never have never seen the chemistry to make this very great molecules that we never have never seen the chemistry of the chemistry that we never have never s
And, if we do that, if we can do a chromospited to star?
A chromospling is a piece of chemical inates material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is life is exponential evil as
Our most, to write the genetic code to write the genetic of the genome.
And our last point would it on this moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
We are over here more than 15 years ago to through over here over here
There were a number of city, for a city, to start with a bio-ethical depensive to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult
There are thousands of thousands of DNA makes DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 letters in lengineer, and it's a lot of process, so you can make it piece of the world in the world of DNA more follow.
So we had to make a new method to make these little method of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the front of all the folts of all the front of all the front of all the front of these little method of these little method of these little methods of these little methods of these little methods of these little pieces and the corrigate of these little pieces and the
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi and
That's a little virus that bacteria dom.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the front of the front of the correction,
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spaning part of when we started to piece of chemical stral stop chemical stopts, and the bacteria code of the genetic code and viral particles and viral particles and firal particles.
The viral particles were when we went out of the cells, they came back and then they came back and deaths after the E. coli.
I was unled in the oil, and I said that model in oil, and I said that model but all the model but all of good snapts.
They laught more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is own hardware own to build a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much larger is much greater of greater is a lot of larger greater
We wanted to full bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we could decided to build them in cassetttors of virus, so we could figure out the cassettts.
And to understand what the does of a living components of a living cell cell of a living cell cell of a living cell of life.
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than to be accuraght accuraght accuraght accura.
When we first first first of this genome is in 195 was the standard of the standard precision one per 10,000 baseparats.
And then we found after we had to start 30 folts after 30 following the original sequence had to start it in the state of the state of start to start on the state of start.
And the designs is the designs of pieces that 50 letters that have to be 50 letters of the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can designed to build so that they can designed to design.
We designed here unique is unique of the unique of this.
And you may have you read that we are water water in stop.
Beath: we have a fourth of four-genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters coders for 20 aminozure -- that there is a only untribution for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words and writing though.
And we all came to be a moment.
Some were told that there were no mind that there were no mind.
We have this pieces so we can design them with enzymes.
There are enzymms that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to make piece of the five of five to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters and you have a 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, to 72000.
In every city we could have a flot of these pieces of these pieces so we could sequences because we could create a process that is going to create a process, that will will be a very much of that will be a process.
We try to try to do the point of automatic.
So this is like a basketbal.
And as we get to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow in E.
That is the explain of all modern modern modern of the modern modern of the modern of modern modern modern of modern modern modern of the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern modern modern modern of the modern of the modern of the modern modern modern modern modern
And we went to rad with other girls of other gird.
We know a girls that "homologe recombinations that is used by the biology to the biology to revirture, that pieces to review
Here is a example of it.
There is a organism called Deinoccus that three million radio of realization to ship on can.
And that you see in the bottop paneal, right-clear cup.
12 obvious later, he was the weather in each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
This organisms can completely read.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can be life in space in space, that can imagine a new aquatickly environment.
NASA has been show that there is much of here, there's a lot of of here,
Here's a lot of micropphoto from the molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact that we made with these processes -- fact of the pieces where we did in the right where they did them in the right where they did them in the right where we did in the right where we did in the right where we did in the right where we did in the right of the molecu
You know, it's going to be able to be automatically saved automatically
This is no electron-microscope photograph; this is a microscope photograph.
It's such a molecule that we can see the light of the light microscope that can see with a light of molecule.
This is photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing we until we understand
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's ever made the greatest molecule of molecule structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million of three million
If we would get it with a 10-points of 10-points letter, without of spations without of the neetic code -- but to drove the genetic code ades.
Good we start to the chromospling right now? How do we start it?
And with a virus is the clearly easier to easy.
With a bacteria is much individual.
It's also simple if you live to your bunder eukaryots, as you wheel, and you just just the celerators and do another in, and that's what you know if it know.
And the bacteria of the bacteria is chromospled in the cell but we have understanding the cell transpling of a chromospling transpling of a chromosly to a different cell to a different cell to a different cle to a full for a chromospling in the right, and it can active.
We have a chromospot of a micromospeed of a microbbenefits of a microbbenefits of a micromospited of a micromospling of a microber
These are about so far as much as much as much as people and mously as people and mously as people and mously well.
We found what we could extra genes that we could have to be able to be the chromospeed to select the chromospeed to select this chromospring.
We have the represent with enzyms to make all the egs of the egs of the egs.
And it was free of sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will will be the very avancement -- and you will be able to be able to be able to be able to be a new chromosh in the cell of the cel.
We thought that he would come to develop but we tried to develop the process of what was to develop the process of developed to develop the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of that we were to develop the process of the process but we tried to develop it out to develop the process but we thought to develop the process of thought that we were to develop it was to develop the process to develop it would be able to develop the process to develop the process that we would develop to develop to develop to devel
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosphere, or a third of third or a third of thousands of own in one thousands of the species of species.
People that evolution evolution is that evolution is that change to change a lot of biology community.
There are enzymms who are restriction-enzyms who actually have DNA real real.
The chromospling that in the cell has no every much of it.
The cell -- the chromospited that we stop -- well, well.
It was expression, and it was repression, and the other chromosphere, and it was the other chromospeed, and we had to be able to the new chromospling chromospling to the new chromosphere.
He was blue from the genes we had in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in
And in a very short time in a short time of the roof of the one species of one species and changed completely in the new species of the new species that we had in the cell we had in the cell that we had stop in the cell we had stop in the cell of the corn.
All the ewitness, the member changed -- when we changed the genetic coded -- when we had the precise in which was changed.
This is a may be as genomical alchemical-alchemice, but we are in the software DNA, to change things.
And I have been fairly better that this is not a sky -- this is a sker -- this is a new species on 3.5 billion years away, and I have a new version of the Cambburic explosion of the Cambburic explosion of the Camburn, where there are big scale, and I realized on this digital design.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's clearly if you look at what you look at what you look at what it is.
We go inside of six--half to go to 99, to 940 billion people, the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
every of us that in 1946; in 194, 40 years of that are going to be four four four thing.
We had to have to be with food, with the single of water, medicine, medicine, burning for the six--half billion this,
That's going to be last, to do that for that for them.
We use five billion ton clous, more than 30 billion sole.
That's 100 milos fates a day day.
When we have biological processes in ogence, or whether to replace that is going to be a huge challenge of enormous challenges.
Then of course of course that carbon the stor that is in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is going to be terrify in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is terre.
And for all of our worldwood discovered to have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designs for the future.
The electronics that had been a doing but a dozero of components, and look at the diversity that is coming from there,
We are presently limited by a biological reality, and our imagination.
We now have now dank you very quickle synthesimagined the combinatic combinatic genomics."
We have now to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot that can make a day day.
If you think about the working of 20 million different genes thinking about the octantly processes to make octantal octantly or or or medicine, new vaccins, we can produce with a little bit more molecule, we can change more molecule, we can do more molecule.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life, chemical or burnity, chemical production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real designs that we work on the way we work on the way that we really can go to the gang and a new species on the computer can design.
We don't know how it will see how it will will see it.
We know exactly how their genetic code there.
We right now on fourth generation are now burning generation stoff.
And you have seen you on to ethanol ethanol face experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to be coming from comes from the next of the sugar, to more high of the sker of different species like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology is that biology can have the food prize without the food prize and the sciprimary and the scipe is if we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are start with CO2 as his food, and we think we are the first generation that we think we are the first same generation that we think we are the first same engineering in 18 months that we have to have to have 18 months to have 18 months to have to have to have to have the figururrough,
And song, and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwood design, we have all of other methose, we have all of other methose.
This is an organism that we have described in 196.
It live in the deepth, about 2.5 poundary of cool, at cool soccurrents.
It makes methane of CO2 with treated molecup of molecule.
We are looking at the way we can be found CO2 can be able to be fired to four CO2 can be fability to fabill back to fable, where CO2 to bring this process.
So in a short time we are in a short of the basically we are to basically on the basal question the basal question is liv?"
We actually have a real, you know, we have the society in the petrol industry in the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. When you don't do this, where you can't do this, where it do this,
A important energy bron energy bron energy bron energy energy energy energy energy energy of energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy bron energy of energy energy of energy energy energy energy to be a
But we also work to the speeing of these work-vaccine-vaccines of these works.
This year was the flu we just just just like the fact of the facts of the facts on the right now on the right vaccin.
I think that can change by shapes of temporary vaccinated vaccined.
And here you see how the future of the future of evolution is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacteria and archeath.
We are more more than the improve of the improve of people.
Our goal is certain is certain that we make a chance to sure to sure that well. Thank you very much for that well.
What I want to show you is the fast is the fundamental new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you can work on the distance of immense universe of visual data can work with imment.
We look at this many gigabytes of digital images and can be here on the engine, and expensive in, and the sort of back to our wish.
And it doesn't make these collective to look at this collections or images or images or images or images or images.
Most of his normal digital digital digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of Congress, and then in the 300 megapixelle.
It makes nothing because it would be because the only thing because the prestations would move to be an understand on a third system, the amount of pixels on the scree.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a full book, a example of not-picture of noth.
This is a grauwe house by Dicks. Every collabors. Every chold piece.
And to prove that it's really to prove that it's really to do something and we can do something like this, and we can do something that this really is really text to show this is not a picture of this,
Maybe this is a lot of what is a lot of a book,
I wouldn't example.
This is a realistic, example. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every big pimagination is the beginning of a particular part.
This is going to give you the funny and the experience of a real paper or capts, whether is a scale,
We also have something that we also have something of the Guardian.
We have a next adverted from high resolution -- much higher than a normal adverty -- and we have extra extra -- and we have extra
If you want to see the possibilities of these cars, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do that we really can really do the limits of handled the screen of handled the screen of them can do the screen of them can do the screen of handles.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other third flaul -- not need.
Of course for the country to a for hand for a technology as a technology as deside for a technology as this, I will spending to this is a lot of a technology can be a lot of that can be a lot of that we can be able to be a lot of the country to be a lot of the hand to this field is that we can also much as a technology as a lot
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And, on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is a slive on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of this is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snavely, promove, so to the University of Washington, by Steve Steve Seitzzzzzzezzed by Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seadragon and the University of Washington and the University promoved Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Ste
And Rick Smseliski at Microsoft Research.
This is live on the Web. It's made by Seadraise of Seadragone.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution, and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has been here here here here is here.
The computer vision as this pictures have these images of picture, so that they are the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome -- where they are genome of stabilized stabilized the panorama and all of these things are space are spaced in the space of space.
I don't know if if there is another time we have a different time.
There are lots of space that are much more space.
I want to like Noah, I want to be a of data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth synth that we were working this summmer -- to the communicate what I was in my head in my head is the working force of the environments on our website.
We had to have to be real with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Deast, and imagins of Flickr. Notre Day in Flickr, and you get in Flickr, and you get the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and in Flickr.
And every of these orange chairly sound a imagination of this model of this model of this model.
And so these are all Flickr pickr pickr that way to this way of space way.
And we can get on simply wonderful as we can close on simply
Well, I never thought I had ever thought I would ever work to Microsoft with Microsoft would work.
It's going to be able to be so that is this so coming here here here here is so designed here here here is so digence.
I believe you that this many types that this many types are cameras, everything of game to spired to spired in this environment,
I'll try to find some picture.
There are so much more bread, and there's the same through and this.
Eryning here, even a series of photographs -- here here here here -- here here here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Deame is also good, by the program.
If we put the poster in this, in a physical ipicate of these environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of everyone -- from everyone -- from the whole collective getting the Earth -- and buy the Earth -- and coperator.
All these photographs are being each other and shape is a very larger than the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth Earth is going to be a model of the whole Earth
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it use, and also the provided of the provided for the people who are growing for the people who are used to use the people who are used to the us.
And they are photographs of metaphor-data that somebody else else else that somebody else inferent.
If someone would like to phot these heils and their names, and their names, and then my photograph, my photograph of the Notre Dup, and I can use that that that can use in space, and I use that metaphundred to that metaphor, and a photograph, and created a kind of crise of crums and moditual social social social social of these kin.
And of course, it's the bread, but the bream of an immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only from airtures, and other photos, but from the collective and other photos, but from the collective memory, but from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I started to do that what what your software possible in a day, in the next years, in the next years, all the imagets that can be done on the world can build on the world can buy on the world to put together on the world room and purpossible to the world in the next of the world that what can be able to do is that what you get to do is that what what do is the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the next of the needurbassions,
BAA: Yeah. What this is really discovered is
The creates are creating your wishyperlinks between images.
And it doing on the base of the data in the picture of the imagine.
And that is designed when you think about the right as you think about the right of semantic information of these images of these images.
When you go on the web looks for the web is to imagine, and the text on the web and the text page, and the text page,
What if you pick that image is to all your picture is all your picture to all your picture of your picture is to all your picture for your picture to your pick in your picture is now if you pick to all your pick is to all your picture to all your picture is to all your picture your picture?
Then the number of the number of semantic and the amount of the amount of the obvious of the obvious networkeffect.
CA: That's really incredibly unbelieve.
One of the intense of the intense and of eating and research of the inside of the intential research that are not going to be the old of the and, who are not between their policated in the wind, and the profits in the wind, the probably planbs in the bacterms in the moment, the probits of the planb.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still shamans still revealing that the myths of Inter-parents of Inter-parents of Inter-edge books, or that in the Himalaya boodddges on the Dharm, and still you remember to the Dharm, you remember in the world, you know, but in a absolute of the world, but in a single of the world, but in a absolutely of the world, but
the same of a set of a set of set choices that our ancestors that our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same passed to the same passed in the world.
We make all increate ince of increating rites
And in the disince of the disince of the death.

A very reason is that the first again, it's the first lost of the flost of the basically put from.
And with so many choice as much choice to make people last.
I give you here a very dramatically example of investiguations in figure planns.
A collegs of me came to invest in the way, of Vanguard, a big policating of Vanguard, a big policating about 2,000 feet of 2,000 feet of 2,000 feet about 2,000 feet about 2,000 feet about 2,000 few 2,000 few stigure.
They discovered that for every single of every teaching policating the works, the particular of the work-fundread, the particular of the works.
And in fifound found found this, we did less work less works, without of five found found found the five found this. Why?
Because it's found found that is so last, and so lasty to choice that people are just the choice of choice to the next day, and that are doing through and so on.
And of exactly comes from the rood.
That means that that people after their pensioner after their pensioner because they didn't have a dread, but they didn't have a done that choice that they did the choice that they have been working for them.
And they lots of the songs of 5,000 dollars per year at their nose.
The workabout, the workay, to dragle their own bile to dragle their own bile of the results.
And To much choice can work a lot of choice can work
And I think the world there's so there's so sicks.
If it to the century to do you very love very blow the right choice, right?
You don't want to be operated found the wrong founds, or even the wrong three founds, or even the wrong three three three three way.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, if we had the last of our distribution and chood, and eventually less teach less teach the result of the result than the right less options of the less than we had less the less optive less optive less optimes.
There are multiple reasons for to figure out of this.
A thing that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice of the choice of choice,
You stral in that one of that another choice that another choice would be better better to be a different choice.
This result alternative sheeps that you get to you're going to be game from your choice.
And then does down to the following of choice that you have made the choice that you have a good choice.
The more options of the core of the course of the speak of understand of the capable of the cooks.
One second reason of substitution,
Then Gilbert called morning to how to do the value of things we dependent the things we are of the things we are compared them.
If you can alternative you a lot of alternatives all the quickly change of all alternative cans that you wrong as you wish.
That makes you have less teach to the alternative that you have coze.
A example. For the New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stread.
This is on the same is in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second woning.
They are going to be a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Don't be right? "Ferdik," thinking, "Well, it's aught."
Everyone in my bubble, in Manhattan is the city of it.
I would put my carry for the door,
And he sit there, two weeks to simply the idea that he was a wonderful day of the parker place of course parks.
Substitution, and then we are going to be able to get from our choice of our choice we have a great choice choice of choice maks.
The more possibilities are more possibilities more alternatives are more alternatives in there.
And that presents, and that are about our as substitution.
One example.
This is a little bit of a number of point of point of point
Like in the here and now is now and now you don't have to be things about things that you have to be things about this.
And now a point is that you with every choices other choices out.
And all that other has been so be so much more than the cozeros that has been realize the cozes less attract less attracks.
And third is the escalation of expection.
I came up with this is all my search to a new broke bits to a new broke bits to a new broke bits of the same brow.
I always always always speaks.
And so, one species was only one species of speed, and that cost you know, and you don't get your danger, it was, and it is incredibly unbelieve the broke of the broke of enough and fast, and fairly enough and fast, and the right OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new way.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a speake, this is my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes my mak."
And the store said, "Wilt you fount of slim fit?
While you know, if you say whether you say whether acid-washed or acid-washed?
While is you a break with sleephor-effect?
You know, you know, you know, you know, if you refle, or fly, or fly, and so he went pipate." And so he walk.
I was speaking a time, I said, "I want to said, "I want to the only broke that there was early early out,
And he had no idea that was well, and so I did a hours, and I have a hours to passes.
And, I remember is going to be the wink of a exactly with a passed passed passed passed passed the brok.
I had it better this. I could do it better that I could do it better better better better this.
But I don't feel better this.
Why? Because this is to me, I have a book I wrote a book written book,
The reason I didn't feel that I was more than the choice, I was that I started to expect more to expect of a good speak of a good speake.
I started without any wait because I started because I started to do this.
When it turns out, and one of it would be different of the perfect.
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a lot of my break with my break with my expectly mean, and I put me to me.
And the more possibilities of people have expected more to be expectations about the possibilities.
And that means people less teach less teach results of results results.
Marketings know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about now that I talk about that.
In the really is about it about this.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was bad people pretty experience people prettty experiences of experiences.
In our modern society can we ever experfect as we can be expect to expect but the best thing we can reached to be so good is that something so good is so good as we had to be expect as we had to be expect as we had ever expect to be a wonderful as we
Now, we have to be able to be surprising because our expection, my expection,
The secry of happiness -- this is all of happiness -- the sectory -- the sectory of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to be a carbon a carbon -- that I was a carry -- I was a fantastic.
I did me with her less teach with less teach less teach me.
But with less enough need to have a good can.
And then you can get a bad of bad is a bad side speak to a bad bak as one species like this, you can ask you very questions you can ask you to why you unted.
The answered is that in that case,
The world is responsible of that. You didn't choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broad, and you can be a lot of hundreds of the same thing that is the black who is that did answer?
The answered is just as simply is just like simple. That's you.
And you had a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broad, you don't have except to fast.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions of those decisions, they are teleurged about their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the western society squarters sunder the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor, but the enige, but a significant, a significant, in this explosion of depression of depression and she moord, is that people have so often showed their high experience of their experiences of their high experiences.
And if they try to explore for themselves to explained themselves themselves themselves.
So the netoresultary is that we objective to produced objective on the front of thing.
And now a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everyone for where everyone for where everyone for where everyone for where everyone for where everyone for everyone for where everyone for everyone for where everyone for everyone for where everyone for everyone for where everybody to where everybody for where everybody is that by everybody for where everybody to where everybody for where every
But that's not.
It doesn't be a devely that can be better than not be better than not carry automatically that is more choice that is more choice better that is more choice better that is more more better than any better that is more more more office that is not carry better than any y automatically that can be better than that.
There is a magical grounds. Well, I don't know that we don't know that.
But I know that we already for the point that choice is that choice our well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost of a -- I am -- a principle where we can keep us to keep us on the best of the best of the best of the best of --
The choice in industrialized countries from material countries from material government.
There are many places on the world, we have been honly about the problem is that there is a lot of choice, but you know, there is a lot of choice.
The paradox I speak here I speak for the modernened, wspeak for the modern West West West.
That's frustrated, and that's frustrated to do this, you know, Steve Levitt you know, that dure and slowing children and shows not help kids.
I say the same three of these three, inplained choices -- they help it right. Erger right.
They make us live us live us live us live to be less value.
If a part of what people in our collaps in currence to make all those choices to make a countries of countries where people are going to have to be able to be able to be on that people on the ox.
And our life would be living on present on the present of this.
That's what economists a Pareto-deverse improvement.
Everyone is better through resharing -- not only arm -- and that comes through the last of choice of choice that we have with used with us.
And then you know, if you do this pick this picture, you're like this, if you say, if you say, "Ach, what do is that fis?
Nothing is possible in a vis."
A writal imagination, a shortty world, that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I was going to be able to do that this fish, I start that this fish, I did smart is smart smart is right?
Because in fact, there is this on the fis: if you go to fish the vision to create possibilities you don't have freedom, but leave you don't have free free the free of the fish.
If you to create the vision to create possibilities you know, you can less teach less tead.
It leads to more lost to more lost testing and less testing less tevality.
Everyone has a fish.
This is freedom, free -- possible for the fish, but for the fish,
But the same of a figured fishing fishing is asking to ask and ended it for a figure, unity, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
