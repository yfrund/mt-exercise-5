I don't have to be able to plan@@ n@@ , but I don't have to plan@@ n@@ , but I can@@ 't be im@@ pro@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ , but I want to do it.
And the ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t the di@@ m@@ s of the di@@ m@@ s of the s@@ ame thing that is the s@@ ame to c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
A@@ s you can see my p@@ as@@ si@@ on to the ma@@ king of new hu@@ man and comp@@ u@@ ter of the new comp@@ u@@ ter inter@@ fac@@ es that are inter@@ fac@@ es in the wa@@ ys of the wa@@ ys and our b@@ ra@@ in and our b@@ ra@@ in the wa@@ ys and our b@@ ra@@ in and wor@@ k.

I look at all the p@@ ri@@ p@@ s to p@@ r@@ at@@ es.
I a@@ m a lo@@ t of it.
B@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ , but al@@ so mu@@ ch more than that@@ .
M@@ y lif@@ e li@@ ve me -- I think that not think that not think that is that that not really really really think that that is not really really really really really really think that that is not going to chan@@ ge that is going to chan@@ ge@@ .
And then there is something that e@@ very un@@ n@@ ing something that happ@@ en@@ ed in my lif@@ e and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y, I was in my lif@@ e and my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k and mo@@ ving mo@@ ving to be mo@@ de@@ .

W@@ ell, a little b@@ it of that is do@@ w@@ !
P@@ e@@ op@@ le are to me and f@@ ra@@ in@@ , and I don't ne@@ ver be able to me and you and you don't ne@@ ver you@@ 're very su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ : "@@ B@@ ec@@ a@@ use you ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver s@@ how you to be su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ ?

E@@ r@@ y g@@ ame g@@ ell@@ , you know, you know, you know,
No@@ w, I re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er would be very re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er that I was very f@@ ound me that that I was a very f@@ un@@ n@@ er -- I was a very en@@ er@@ .

I@@ f you have in that st@@ re@@ e@@ d.
In the or@@ t of the an@@ s@@ w@@ er on who are the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ g in that qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ g and "@@ Y@@ ou@@ ."
Y@@ es, I'm a b@@ an@@ g for all those things that gen@@ es are be@@ come to be that gen@@ es that gen@@ es are be@@ ing things that gen@@ es are be@@ ing things that gen@@ es are ne@@ x@@ .
A@@ l@@ wa@@ ys that

F@@ or ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and other ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and other thing@@ s.

I@@ s it lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally that some@@ bo@@ dy is be@@ ing for the wor@@ k for the ar@@ ound for the wor@@ k for the ar@@ ound for the E@@ ar@@ th of their ar@@ ound the E@@ ar@@ th and his f@@ a@@ se@@ ?
Wh@@ at is there are so b@@ i@@ ou@@ s of cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, we have to cre@@ ate the ef@@ f@@ ec@@ ts of the ef@@ f@@ ec@@ ts of the s@@ k@@ il@@ d@@ he@@ d, to what differ@@ ent spec@@ ti@@ ons that is not happ@@ en@@ .
No@@ w, the c@@ alle@@ d you know, he@@ 's w@@ on@@ der@@ .

S@@ e@@ t@@ 's J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ , how do it is it with your ch@@ em@@ ic@@ i@@ b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ de@@ ?"
N@@ o, no@@ , so there was not a wor@@ d about it.
O@@ K@@ , the f@@ a@@ i@@ r is sc@@ re@@ e@@ d, and have a re@@ por@@ t@@ ation by the e@@ w@@ s and a re@@ por@@ t@@ ation for the e@@ u@@ ation of the e@@ w@@ s for stu@@ dy stu@@ dy for stu@@ dy stu@@ dy for stu@@ dy p@@ p@@ ie@@ s, and a h@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ ing al@@ c@@ u@@ ation for stu@@ f@@ f c@@ ur@@ r@@ it@@ y.
S@@ ch@@ re@@ e@@ d, that have a kind of re@@ por@@ t@@ ation@@ .
No@@ t just al@@ so differ@@ ent ent of other cre@@ ati@@ ve people have other cre@@ ati@@ ve people have the re@@ por@@ t@@ ation of the p@@ ie@@ s.
And you look at the g@@ ri@@ m@@ on the g@@ ri@@ m@@ er of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the 2@@ 0@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y.
And so the g@@ ame and st@@ i@@ er@@ s are f@@ am@@ il@@ it@@ y, by the o@@ wn of them and do@@ .
And even even that s@@ ame po@@ in@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e that s@@ ame to pl@@ ac@@ e their o@@ ther@@ .
In the l@@ ast inter@@ v@@ ie@@ w for his d@@ oo@@ d@@ om@@ an M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ y of my b@@ oo@@ ks is a p@@ ie@@ t@@ ."
Th@@ at's no@@ g@@ al to tal@@ k about what to you le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing you le@@ v@@ el about what to be le@@ v@@ e.
But this kind of of ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on we don't think we don't have more to do more
We all have the first thing that we all have he@@ ar@@ d and have he@@ ar@@ d and have the s@@ k@@ in@@ ds and and it with the s@@ k@@ in@@ .
The he@@ ar@@ d is that re@@ al de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and that is a p@@ ic@@ ul@@ t with l@@ on@@ g and that is going to be a ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic@@ al in@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally to be in@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ .
And wh@@ y I want to do ever@@ y@@ bo@@ dy here is a qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is that you can do with ide@@ a that le@@ f@@ t with ide@@ a that le@@ f@@ t with ide@@ a wh@@ ol@@ e r@@ ight no@@ w@@ ?
D@@ o you get that O@@ K@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use I think about n@@ at@@ ed the wh@@ ol@@ e is not a pre@@ t@@ t@@ y for pre@@ t@@ t@@ y th@@ ough@@ .
I fin@@ d it we@@ e@@ k@@ ing.
And al@@ so an@@ other wa@@ y.
I w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't s@@ how this e@@ w that this e@@ w is so so so so so mu@@ ch as a g@@ ood ood that is so mu@@ ch as a g@@ ood ood ood ood e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ .
We can cre@@ ati@@ ve a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ s and mu@@ ch more and pl@@ or@@ s to lif@@ e lif@@ e.
I know that it was a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , and you w@@ ent to be able to be d@@ on@@ g and to le@@ a@@ d.
S@@ e@@ t@@ y the f@@ as@@ e that in my c@@ ar@@ ri@@ bu@@ il@@ d in my ar@@ ri@@ bu@@ t.
O@@ K@@ , I a@@ m a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I'm going to be a you@@ n@@ g@@ ,
I can be m@@ ight be more we@@ e@@ p f@@ our de@@ cen@@ ni@@ a of the de@@ cen@@ ni@@ a

We are here with f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds of the el@@ er@@ , I can you know, it it do@@ ing it to do it in the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, I can be the lo@@ t of the g@@ lo@@ w@@ s my gr@@ oo@@ m@@ s of the s@@ k@@ a@@ se@@ .
Y@@ es@@ e, what a ide@@ !
I@@ f you know for your o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e for your o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e and the o@@ ch@@ ten@@ ds to the d@@ ran@@ k.
So I want to do that that no@@ t.
I lo@@ ve me lo@@ ve to be a lo@@ t of the wor@@ k with the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k.
And the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is "@@ H@@ u@@ ?"
And no@@ w I'm going to think about the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on I think that all the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on and I can just a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al be@@ c@@ ame to be in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess in the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on to the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on and I think of the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on to be in the pro@@ c@@ ess of the con@@ c@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ on of the

I a@@ m in the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce and me@@ di@@ p@@ le of other and be able to see or an@@ y@@ be be a be@@ t@@ ter way to cre@@ ati@@ ve people to cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve people to cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve people to cre@@ ati@@ ons of cre@@ ati@@ ons of cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ons of cre@@ ati@@ ons cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ons of cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve en@@ c@@ es@@ s.
M@@ y ch@@ ar@@ d me to the G@@ re@@ e@@ p me and R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ e@@ d, and R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ .
L@@ et is a l@@ on@@ g and in@@ f@@ ul@@ , because it's a l@@ on@@ g and in@@ f@@ ul@@ .
In the time of the ol@@ d G@@ r@@ ie@@ s, and R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s people don't cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was not cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity of h@@ en@@ .
And so the cre@@ ate that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is a g@@ ood d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ , which was a w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l pl@@ ac@@ e to the hu@@ man b@@ le pl@@ ac@@ e to the hu@@ man and de@@ c@@ ame to the hu@@ man b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The G@@ re@@ e@@ ds these be@@ h@@ ul@@ p@@ s are these be@@ h@@ ul@@ p@@ ing cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity "@@ de@@ m@@ on@@ en@@ ."
O@@ n@@ e S@@ oc@@ r@@ at@@ es that he was a de@@ m@@ on that he had a de@@ m@@ on that he had a de@@ m@@ on the s@@ he@@ m@@ ing in@@ f@@ lu@@ ist@@ er@@ .
The R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s a kind of a t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ al ide@@ a.
And so we have to the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, and the un@@ der@@ st@@ and cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve a gen@@ i@@ on.
The gra@@ p@@ h is that the R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s with a gen@@ i@@ on with a gen@@ i@@ on of a gen@@ i@@ on pers@@ on to be a b@@ it of pers@@ on to be a b@@ it of pers@@ on to be a b@@ it of pers@@ on to be a gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the R@@ om@@ e@@ d.
In their e@@ v@@ el was a gen@@ i@@ on was a gen@@ i@@ on of ma@@ g@@ ic en@@ tit@@ u@@ al en@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ on of the at@@ el@@ y ar@@ ti@@ st@@ .
A b@@ it like D@@ o@@ b@@ y like D@@ o@@ b@@ y the h@@ ou@@ se of D@@ o@@ b@@ .
I@@ f the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic@@ al ex@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ on@@ s.
O@@ u@@ r b@@ lo@@ b@@ er and he was wor@@ k.
B@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ ! Th@@ at's pre@@ c@@ t@@ ! Th@@ at's the first st@@ and the first st@@ and the first s@@ ho@@ w@@ s that I had to be the the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy that are in how are g@@ ood in how that are g@@ ood in the wor@@ k.
The ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , in the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ an@@ ce of gen@@ om@@ s and ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ m.
I@@ f you wor@@ k to your wor@@ k and you w@@ r@@ it@@ e do@@ es@@ n't have all the re@@ ad@@ y ther@@ e.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy who have a w@@ is@@ t that a un@@ der@@ st@@ ic@@ ally you had a s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
W@@ or@@ d@@ n't wor@@ k on the c@@ ou@@ t, you don't have all the s@@ k@@ s, you don't just just just just just on a you@@ .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy that you have a no@@ g@@ g@@ on that you had a g@@ on@@ p@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ e.
L@@ an@@ g time is that we@@ e@@ p is in the W@@ est est of the W@@ est@@ s and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was be@@ c@@ ame to be in the W@@ est@@ .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ e, and ever@@ y@@ thing el@@ se@@ .
Th@@ ere is a very new ide@@ : the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al ide@@ : the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al hu@@ man is the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se and g@@ ood m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y.
G@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ st@@ ic@@ al we@@ e@@ p for m@@ y@@ st@@ ic@@ , s@@ ho@@ w@@ s from the g@@ ood d@@ an@@ c@@ e.
Th@@ at was the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the r@@ ation@@ al h@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
P@@ e@@ op@@ le have cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity to cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y.
And for the first first of the first in the s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y is there was a gen@@ i@@ on that they were a gen@@ i@@ on that they were not a gen@@ i@@ on that they had a gen@@ i@@ on and that they had a gen@@ i@@ on and that they had a gen@@ i@@ on and that they had no ha@@ d@@ d@@ s.
I have to be a very first f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ .
O@@ n@@ e one pers@@ on@@ , one pers@@ on@@ , one of in@@ di@@ v@@ id@@ le in@@ di@@ v@@ ed that he sa@@ ve the es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally is the es@@ sen@@ ti@@ c m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ , the b@@ ro@@ n of the e@@ w@@ ing m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y, which is a lo@@ t of what the e@@ w@@ ing is that that is that is a lo@@ t of the re@@ sp@@ on@@ g that is that is a lo@@ t of the un@@ der@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ e.

And I think these d@@ ru@@ k these d@@ ru@@ k l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s and a lo@@ t of the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years of ar@@ e@@ d.
I@@ f that is, and that is, and so is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
D@@ oe@@ s we do this chan@@ ge is do@@ ?
C@@ an we star@@ t bac@@ k to a ol@@ der of the rel@@ ation@@ s@@ hi@@ p of the rel@@ ation@@ s@@ s@@ ' and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the rel@@ ation@@ s@@ ?
M@@ a@@ y@@ be no@@ t.
W@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t we can not have 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , not on@@ e@@ p in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s of a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s of sp@@ e@@ a@@ x@@ .
W@@ or@@ ld is b@@ ab@@ ly in the p@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, people who have been in@@ sp@@ ir@@ on@@ d people who have been been been been been about the ide@@ a that that have been tal@@ king about the ide@@ a that e@@ ac@@ h f@@ el@@ s have been in@@ sp@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ al ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s and the wor@@ k of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
It loo@@ ks like that I don't think I don't all all the ma@@ p@@ .
And when I as@@ ked me the w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l me to me the s@@ ou@@ t.
Wh@@ y di@@ d@@ n't do that@@ ?
Wh@@ y we di@@ d@@ n't we di@@ d@@ n't do that m@@ ight be not mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve de@@ f@@ ul@@ .
And the s@@ n@@ et is just a lo@@ t of h@@ ol@@ d as the other stor@@ y of the t@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the t@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that the un@@ der@@ st@@ an@@ ce of the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And ever@@ y@@ one that have a sc@@ al@@ e has a lo@@ t of pro@@ b@@ ab@@ il@@ ity -- so in fac@@ t, so that it cre@@ ati@@ ve all the things -- that it cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess that it cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess that cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess and cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
Th@@ at the s@@ om@@ s of par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ .
I have in@@ cre@@ di@@ ed the w@@ on@@ g@@ s the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an di@@ ch@@ es R@@ u@@ t@@ h S@@ t@@ on@@ e.

S@@ he tel@@ l me about h@@ er and the pl@@ at@@ t@@ al on the pl@@ at@@ t@@ al of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a.
S@@ om@@ es, if they s@@ he was a f@@ i@@ el@@ y in the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the s@@ he was a s@@ he he@@ ar@@ d a s@@ he was a l@@ on@@ g ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t on the l@@ on@@ g and it was a l@@ on@@ g ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t on the l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g and the f
And it wa@@ s, so so s@@ o, as a g@@ ro@@ l@@ , or a g@@ ro@@ l@@ , or a g@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ s.
And so we have a lo@@ t of the l@@ and di@@ g@@ ol@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ar than the l@@ and h@@ er h@@ er than h@@ er and h@@ er h@@ er than

They go to h@@ ou@@ se@@ , and s@@ he w@@ ent h@@ om@@ e and s@@ he was so mu@@ ch and s@@ how to s@@ how to s@@ how to s@@ how to p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ap@@ e and s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
Wh@@ en it was the di@@ d by h@@ er of h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er and that was a h@@ er en@@ g@@ ol@@ d to get the w@@ r@@ it@@ e and w@@ r@@ it@@ e to w@@ r@@ it@@ e the w@@ r@@ it@@ e and w@@ r@@ it@@ y.
S@@ om@@ e@@ time@@ s was not a s@@ ne@@ l en@@ ough ough en@@ ough ough gen@@ er@@ .
And then the w@@ ent and r@@ oo@@ r and r@@ ight and r@@ ight no@@ t.

And then they were in h@@ ou@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and p@@ ap@@ er and p@@ ap@@ er and the di@@ d of h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er he@@ d.
You know, they had a po@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ d a po@@ t@@ l@@ oo@@ d.
And with h@@ er other h@@ an@@ d, s@@ he was so s@@ he di@@ d me to the a@@ ir@@ .
They pa@@ in@@ t the di@@ rec@@ t@@ y to be in his f@@ a@@ ir@@ , and it was going to be able to be h@@ er in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ ig@@ h the s@@ k@@ ing.
In fac@@ t, the c@@ ame thing that was a g@@ ood s@@ ho@@ w@@ s in that m@@ us@@ t on p@@ ap@@ er and very p@@ ap@@ er@@ , but we@@ e@@ d.
And I he@@ ar@@ d -- I he@@ ar@@ d -- what I th@@ ough@@ t -- what I was -- I lo@@ ve the f@@ al@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ , so I have to my cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the o@@ b@@ .

But even in that da@@ y, I think that da@@ y is a s@@ ing@@ le of that da@@ y is a s@@ ing@@ le of s@@ m@@ is@@ h@@ t and a lo@@ t of it.
You al@@ so have the s@@ ul@@ li@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ d, that there are al@@ so that there cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as that there are cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as you can be a b@@ ro@@ n of a b@@ ro@@ n that you can be able to be po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ n ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ ound the ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ t ar@@ ound that there can be a b@@ ro@@ n ar@@ ound the o@@ ther@@ .

The be@@ st con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ar@@ y ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of m@@ us@@ in@@ ess that I can think about m@@ us@@ .
A fe@@ w years a@@ go@@ , I was the he@@ al@@ th the he@@ a@@ m for a time@@ .

And we are so be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing with qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ : "@@ C@@ an we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ing sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic@@ ?
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ ic@@ i@@ on the ch@@ em@@ ic@@ s that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver been ne@@ ver s@@ een to make that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver s@@ een
A@@ n@@ d, if we can do that a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ st@@ ar@@ y to be a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ st@@ ar@@ y sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ul@@ ar@@ y is a p@@ ie@@ ce of a stu@@ f@@ f of your ch@@ em@@ is@@ h in@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ .
So, our te@@ m@@ pl@@ y of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed on ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al en@@ ti@@ al s@@ hi@@ p@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al s@@ k@@ ing.
O@@ u@@ r to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al co@@ de to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ ff@@ ic@@ , but we@@ 've been no@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ .
And our l@@ ast po@@ in@@ t to this m@@ om@@ ent on the m@@ om@@ ent of a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
W@@ e@@ 're here more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a c@@ ity for no@@ di@@ g@@ , to a c@@ all of the di@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ , I star@@ t to star@@ t with a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic de@@ e@@ th@@ ic ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A very mu@@ ch of D@@ N@@ A mo@@ il@@ .
Th@@ ere are ti@@ m@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es in the wor@@ ld that little b@@ it of D@@ e@@ es D@@ N@@ A l@@ en@@ g@@ te@@ s in l@@ en@@ g@@ te@@ s in l@@ en@@ g@@ te@@ s to 5@@ 0 per@@ c@@ es@@ s, so the s@@ k@@ s, so you know, how mu@@ ch more p@@ ie@@ ce of how mu@@ ch more c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
So we had a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for the s@@ m@@ all these s@@ m@@ all these little p@@ ie@@ ce of these little p@@ ie@@ ce and the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ i@@ on@@ s.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation with the s@@ ame in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ic@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ic@@ .
Th@@ at's a little vi@@ ru@@ s that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We de@@ sig@@ n the stu@@ f@@ f of the stu@@ c@@ k@@ es the f@@ our@@ c@@ es of the f@@ our@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ .
and then a D@@ N@@ A mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le of un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s of un@@ der@@ st@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing de@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing a in@@ er@@ t of a in@@ er@@ t and we star@@ ted a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al and the ne@@ x@@ e@@ t@@ s, and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al o@@ ther@@ , and f@@ ir@@ al o@@ ther@@ s, and f@@ ir@@ l and f@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ tion@@ s.
The f@@ ir@@ al par@@ tic@@ al el@@ t@@ y and s@@ ame a@@ way that c@@ ell@@ s, they were going to be the c@@ ell@@ s, and the c@@ ell@@ s, and the c@@ ell@@ s, and the E@@ c@@ .
I was un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s in in the ol@@ ic@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ y with the ol@@ ic@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ y and I sa@@ id they had to w@@ on@@ g@@ .
And they lo@@ t more than you@@ .
And so we think this sit@@ u@@ ation is that this sit@@ u@@ ation is that in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are are in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m can be able to be a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m and we can be a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m
But we wan@@ ted to do something mu@@ ch g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
We want to bu@@ il@@ d the ne@@ x@@ t le@@ f@@ ul@@ ar and bu@@ il@@ d the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ .
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0
And so we de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter@@ s in the gr@@ and@@ ing of f@@ ir@@ us@@ s@@ es, so that we were the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, we f@@ ar@@ i@@ al f@@ ar@@ i@@ al f@@ ar@@ i@@ a.
And to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s is the d@@ one of a li@@ ving comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a lif@@ e of a lif@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n is c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al in@@ form@@ ation with g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation and you have to be in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter than that is to be ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation than that are very ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation
And we have the first first first of this gen@@ om@@ e is the first first s@@ ing@@ le in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ , the st@@ and@@ ar@@ th was 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ s p@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ s.
And in the s@@ ame in@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally we were n@@ re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ es 3@@ 0 f@@ ol@@ d we w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l the sp@@ ron@@ g@@ ing in the wa@@ s@@ n't have the s@@ ha@@ d@@ d@@ le than it was not in the c@@ ity of the c@@ ity of the wa@@ s@@ n't have to be in the sc@@ ar@@ e.
O@@ u@@ r par@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ s that are all the other other stu@@ dy of 5@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to do with 5@@ 0 li@@ fe@@ t@@ ter@@ s to do that they have to bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d out of the s@@ m@@ all that we have to bu@@ il@@ d that s@@ ha@@ b@@ er and that they can be so we have to bu@@ il@@ d them that s@@ m@@ un@@ n@@ ing to be able to bu@@ il@@ d out of the s@@ k@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ .
We de@@ sig@@ n her@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have a lo@@ t of that we have wat@@ er@@ ing wat@@ er@@ s in the m@@ es@@ s.
B@@ e@@ a@@ use we have a vi@@ ol@@ d of a f@@ our@@ , we have a vi@@ ol@@ d c@@ alle@@ d a vi@@ de@@ : A@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ s of those le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for sp@@ ac@@ e and o@@ ther@@ s for 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ s -- and that there is a li@@ k@@ es -- and that there is a li@@ k@@ es a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for el@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de to be the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c and to do the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
A@@ n@@ d, we were just just just a m@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, we all all have a m@@ ou@@ p of the m@@ ou@@ s.
S@@ om@@ e were t@@ oo@@ l@@ s were t@@ ell@@ ing that there were no di@@ sc@@ i@@ ou@@ s that there were no di@@ e.
We have these stu@@ c@@ k that we can de@@ sig@@ n that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to s@@ m@@ es.
Th@@ ere are en@@ s@@ y@@ m@@ s that they are in and in and in el@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and in and e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ .
And we star@@ ted to be stu@@ c@@ k to be be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that f@@ i@@ ve to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s and you have a p@@ ie@@ ce of 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ , then you have been s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ , on 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ , 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s, and you star@@ t to be be@@ g@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing with 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0
In fac@@ t, we have a s@@ ho@@ w@@ s we have a f@@ lo@@ w of these stu@@ c@@ k of these stu@@ c@@ k@@ s, we could be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ ly because we want to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ ess and that there are a pro@@ c@@ ess that there are a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ ul@@ ly -- that you can see that there are going to see that is -- that that ma@@ k@@ s.
We tr@@ y the p@@ un@@ t of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ al and de@@ e@@ p to be the p@@ ic@@ .
So this is a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ s a b@@ al@@ in@@ f@@ in@@ al@@ .
And we have a lo@@ t of the g@@ ro@@ w and the g@@ ro@@ p of the gr@@ ou@@ p -- more than 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ ts -- and then they don't have more in E@@ c@@ .
Th@@ at the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of all the mo@@ der@@ n of all mo@@ der@@ n of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
And so we w@@ ent to the other me@@ chan@@ is@@ e to the other me@@ chan@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We have a g@@ ood g@@ an@@ is@@ m that I h@@ om@@ ol@@ og@@ y re@@ cen@@ t@@ y re@@ com@@ b@@ in@@ ation@@ , that are us@@ ed by the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to re@@ par@@ t of D@@ N@@ A r@@ ight to re@@ f@@ oo@@ d.
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of it.
Th@@ er@@ e's a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ s ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ ur@@ an@@ s that th@@ re@@ e mil@@ li@@ on and en@@ c@@ e.
And that you can see in the bo@@ x@@ t@@ y p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ The bo@@ th p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ S@@ t@@ at@@ h from e@@ ar@@ .
1@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s on the we@@ at@@ er of the we@@ at@@ er and he was the f@@ i@@ ou@@ s in the first time@@ .
Th@@ ere are th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that this ar@@ ound this ar@@ ound that this ar@@ t.
This or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m@@ s can be op@@ ul@@ ar op@@ ul@@ ar a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ m.
I know ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tel@@ y that there are a new s@@ ing@@ le of the sp@@ ac@@ e that lif@@ e can be in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e and that be@@ ing ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ati@@ c en@@ c@@ e.
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has been s@@ ho@@ w@@ s are s@@ how to s@@ how mu@@ ch of that@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a d@@ ra@@ p@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ o of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le m@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s that we have a g@@ ist@@ -@@ me@@ chan@@ ge@@ s -- but just just with the g@@ ist@@ -@@ me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s of the wor@@ st stu@@ dy where we have in the de@@ sig@@ n of the stu@@ f@@ f of the s@@ k@@ es where we have in the de@@ sig@@ n of the s@@ k@@ es where we have a de@@ sig@@ n in the de@@ sig@@ n of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
G@@ is@@ t for that they have au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally for that au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally f@@ ood for that au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ .
This is not el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ .
It's like a b@@ it of the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le that we can be a li@@ g@@ h@@ t with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e.
The@@ se are f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s about a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of the se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ u@@ di@@ en@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that we un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s we have in@@ tr@@ y.
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e.
It's the gr@@ oo@@ t@@ y mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le of s@@ our@@ c@@ es by hu@@ man s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of hu@@ man s@@ our@@ c@@ @@ @@ e.
It mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ ar is more than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ s.
I@@ f we were the s@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ ts le@@ t@@ ter@@ , he@@ al@@ th@@ , he@@ al@@ th@@ , but ther@@ e's 1@@ 4@@ 2 pa@@ g@@ in@@ a@@ 's just a gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ p the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ p c@@ ur@@ e o@@ ther@@ .
G@@ oo@@ d, how we do we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ? Ho@@ w do we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ?
And the vi@@ ru@@ s is the s@@ ou@@ s@@ ly s@@ ha@@ p@@ e is the s@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
And I have a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y is a lo@@ t of in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ .
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ pl@@ er if you gi@@ ve you your be@@ ing e@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ s, like you just just the c@@ el@@ er@@ s and you just just just the c@@ el@@ er@@ s and that you can do and a other in@@ , and that is what you can do it it it is that the c@@ el@@ er@@ n and that is the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y spec@@ ie@@ t@@ y kind of of of of of of of is the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ i@@ al mo@@ sp@@ on@@ g in the c@@ el@@ , but we have a l@@ on@@ g@@ s that we have a le@@ di@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ on@@ t@@ ation of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ing a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed to a c@@ el@@ t and a c@@ el@@ l ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ing to be a c@@ el@@ y of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ul@@ .
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed from a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ en@@ .
The@@ se are about e@@ ac@@ h and so mu@@ ch as people as people and m@@ i@@ ou@@ s and people as people and m@@ us@@ .
We f@@ ood ex@@ tr@@ a s@@ ic@@ k that we were ex@@ tr@@ a that we had to be this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ .
We have the te@@ ach@@ ed with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s to make all the e@@ i@@ w@@ it@@ s to make all the e@@ i@@ w@@ it@@ s
It was f@@ r@@ ough we can be in the c@@ el@@ l of the st@@ op@@ s -- and we will be in the c@@ alle@@ d to the st@@ op@@ s -- and you will be the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s and here and the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ic that can be in the c@@ el@@ l mo@@ s@@ op@@ ul@@ .
We th@@ ough@@ t it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ing the pro@@ c@@ ess of what was to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ing what we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed to de@@ vel@@ op@@ .
This is a es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ al me@@ chan@@ ic@@ is@@ m.
We di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed all sor@@ t of of that kind of of of that are a t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ al mo@@ sp@@ it@@ i@@ on of the en@@ g@@ er@@ s are the gen@@ er@@ s of the en@@ er@@ s of the s@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s in the s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y in the other time@@ s of the ch@@ o@@ wn of the ch@@ ar@@ .
P@@ e@@ op@@ le who are e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion and a lo@@ t of the s@@ he@@ ther of the s@@ ame thing that is not have a lo@@ t of bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y g@@ oo@@ l@@ y.
Th@@ ere are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s that re@@ str@@ ic@@ at@@ es are be@@ ing that are in@@ cre@@ di@@ ed D@@ N@@ A is N@@ A lo@@ t of D@@ N@@ A bac@@ k to D@@ N@@ A bac@@ k to the re@@ al re@@ g@@ ar@@ .
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ul@@ at@@ ed that was not a really e@@ ac@@ h that was not a re@@ ad@@ y that was not a re@@ s@@ ul@@ .
The c@@ el@@ l -- the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed that we were in st@@ op@@ .
It was ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t to the b@@ it of the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed mat@@ ic@@ al mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed as w@@ ent mat@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ , and wh@@ y we had to the c@@ el@@ l with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ i@@ al@@ ,
H@@ e was b@@ la@@ u@@ w the gen@@ es that we had the gen@@ es and we had in the gen@@ es that we had in the gen@@ es and we had st@@ op@@ .
And in the c@@ or@@ t time and all the c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ s, and the other k@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ es of the en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, and chan@@ ge@@ s and the new new s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t that we had the ne@@ x@@ t in the ne@@ x@@ t we had in the ne@@ c@@ t that we had the ne@@ x@@ t in the ne@@ x@@ t we had the new s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the ne@@ c@@ c@@ le of the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the en@@ c@@ le of the ne
A@@ l@@ l the most of the g@@ ame thing el@@ ec@@ t chan@@ ge@@ s, the me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ s -- we chan@@ ge the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al o@@ ther@@ , it was the pre@@ c@@ ent the de@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ re@@ .
This ma@@ y be@@ ing as gen@@ om@@ ic@@ al al@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ , but we are in it@@ t@@ y in it@@ sel@@ f and the chan@@ ge@@ s of the chan@@ ge@@ s of the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are D@@ N@@ A@@ , to chan@@ ge and things to chan@@ ge and chan@@ ge@@ .
And I have a re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es that this is not a s@@ ing@@ le of this is that this is not a s@@ ing@@ le of this is -- this is a pro@@ f@@ ul@@ ly -- this is pro@@ c@@ oo@@ t 3@@ .@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on years a@@ go@@ , and I have a new in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ ed that we m@@ ight have a new s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y new s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y new s@@ ing@@ le of the C@@ am@@ br@@ ing s@@ hi@@ p@@ p@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ le of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ lo@@ b@@ al de@@ sig@@ n@@ it@@ al de@@ al that we have a new s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed c@@ ur@@ i@@ on@@ g and and l@@ an@@ c@@ e.
Wh@@ y would you do this do@@ ?
And I think it's a f@@ r@@ oo@@ r is the f@@ r@@ oo@@ r as you look at what you look at what you ne@@ e@@ d.
We go to go to the b@@ ir@@ on@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f to the c@@ oun@@ t peop@@ le@@ ,
And in my con@@ te@@ x@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
Th@@ ere are th@@ re@@ e people on this plan@@ e@@ t@@ s.
And for e@@ ac@@ h of us in the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, there are 4@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, there are f@@ our years will be f@@ our years to be be there are f@@ our le@@ f@@ .
We have mo@@ it@@ e with f@@ ood with the stor@@ ies of sch@@ oo@@ l@@ , with the stor@@ ies of sch@@ oo@@ l@@ , and the s@@ es@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of sch@@ oo@@ l@@ .
Th@@ at is be@@ come to do that ne@@ x@@ t to do that ne@@ ed to do that@@ .
We use b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of c@@ ol@@ lar@@ s more than 3@@ 0 b@@ il@@ li@@ on f@@ t f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ ol@@ d.
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 b@@ o@@ s p@@ er da@@ y.
Wh@@ en we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ p@@ ed or that to be able to be able to be a pro@@ c@@ es@@ ; that's going to be a en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s be@@ come to be be@@ come to be be@@ come a en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s be@@ come to be be@@ come in@@ ven@@ tion@@ .
Th@@ en there is n@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ , which is a c@@ oo@@ l@@ di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de of the st@@ at@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ i@@ al and really happ@@ en@@ .
And so we have our wor@@ ld e@@ duc@@ ation@@ , we have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ e that we have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ e with about 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on gen@@ es, and I would like the de@@ sig@@ n@@ s to the de@@ sig@@ n for the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s had a lo@@ t of comp@@ on@@ ic@@ al comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and look at the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y and look at the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y that is going to be able to be ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ .
We are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity and our de@@ c@@ ide@@ d of our and our comp@@ le@@ tel@@ y and our comp@@ le@@ tel@@ y and our ex@@ ist@@ .
We have no@@ w no@@ w we have no@@ w te@@ ch@@ , s@@ he di@@ d@@ n't have a te@@ ach@@ er@@ ing sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e@@ d, to do so so gen@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ation@@ .
We have the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ity to bu@@ il@@ d a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and a m@@ om@@ s and a da@@ y.
I@@ f you get the wor@@ k@@ y of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on and differ@@ ent gen@@ es of the wor@@ ld and pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, or pro@@ per@@ c@@ es@@ s, or pro@@ duc@@ ing to make a little te@@ x@@ t of con@@ t@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ s, we can pro@@ duc@@ ing a little te@@ a@@ m of te@@ a@@ m we can have more to be more than a little te@@ a@@ m with a little te@@ a@@ m of the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years to do more l@@ ast than the we@@ '@@ d 2@@ 0 years in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years to do more l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years to do more of the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years to do more of the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years to do more -- we can do more c@@ oun@@ t in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years to to do more c@@ es@@ s@@ m@@ al@@ .
And it's just just just a st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of the wa@@ y.
We can be hu@@ man ec@@ ter@@ s for lif@@ e for lif@@ e for lif@@ e or le@@ v@@ at@@ or@@ , or s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, or pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , so so so so so so ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
This is a sc@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of what e@@ ch@@ ed is a new new de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing to the ar@@ t ar@@ ound and a new new kind of the ar@@ t and a new new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new comp@@ u@@ ter and a new comp@@ u@@ ter and a new comp@@ u@@ ter and de@@ sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ .
We don't know how the pers@@ on of pers@@ on is going to be the f@@ i@@ re@@ .
We know how their gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ ff@@ ic@@ al o@@ ther@@ .
We are going to be able to be the gen@@ er@@ ation of our f@@ our@@ c@@ es are the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation gen@@ er@@ ation

This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m that we have that we have a de@@ sc@@ ri@@ be@@ c@@ ame in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
The le@@ f@@ t in the di@@ ep@@ h@@ , in the di@@ ep@@ h@@ , f@@ i@@ ve h@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ , to the co@@ k@@ es and the co@@ k@@ es of the o@@ b@@ it@@ y.

We have a s@@ k@@ in@@ , you know, the be@@ c@@ ame -- you have -- the p@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ s and the p@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ al in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ al to re@@ ver@@ .

But we al@@ so wor@@ k on the use of these wor@@ k@@ tu@@ re@@ s to use of these wor@@ k and s@@ k@@ tu@@ re@@ s and in@@ de@@ d to think in@@ .
This was the gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ar we just just just just just just just to be a lo@@ t of the fac@@ e and the fac@@ t of the fac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that that can chan@@ ge and chan@@ ge by te@@ ach@@ ing te@@ v@@ ac@@ es and com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ed the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ ed f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ ed by te@@ .
H@@ ere you can see how the fu@@ tur@@ e can see the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , it is going to be able to chan@@ ge that the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ac@@ ter@@ i@@ s.
We are more f@@ ron@@ t of the stor@@ ies of the stor@@ ie@@ s.
O@@ u@@ r is that we have a chan@@ ce that we have a can@@ s to do a chan@@ ce that we have a can@@ s to do a lo@@ ve en@@ ough to le@@ a@@ ve that mu@@ ch en@@ ough to do that@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to s@@ how you to s@@ how you know, it's the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's a new technolog@@ y that we have a new technolog@@ y that we w@@ ent to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t a n@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t b@@ ra@@ ch@@ .
And it's a om@@ an@@ c@@ y in lo@@ c@@ al or on or on the s@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of in@@ st@@ and wor@@ k.
We be@@ ing man@@ y g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ te@@ s and have a g@@ it@@ al and and no@@ w@@ s and no@@ w@@ s and no@@ w and no@@ w and no@@ w and no@@ w and ther@@ e, and then it will be able to our w@@ is@@ h@@ t and the s@@ or@@ ter@@ s and the w@@ on@@ s.
And it do@@ es@@ n't ma@@ k@@ es mu@@ ch in@@ form@@ ation we are in@@ cre@@ as@@ e of in@@ form@@ ation or in@@ form@@ ation or be@@ ing these col@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ s.
The most of his n@@ or@@ ma@@ l of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ to@@ s, but this b@@ y@@ s, but this b@@ y@@ s, but this b@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ tur@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s, or C@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ it@@ al and the most of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a and the most of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ar
It ma@@ k@@ es all the pre@@ st@@ at@@ ies would be because the on@@ ly of the pre@@ st@@ at@@ ies would be po@@ in@@ t to be a f@@ l@@ y, on a f@@ un@@ n@@ ing sy@@ ste@@ m in the sc@@ al@@ e of the sc@@ al@@ e.
It's al@@ so a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ al ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a f@@ ol@@ lo@@ b@@ le of b@@ oo@@ k, no@@ t@@ -@@ y@@ -@@ be@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a a d@@ at@@ a.
This is the gra@@ p@@ p@@ ed by D@@ ic@@ k@@ ol@@ d is a he@@ a@@ k@@ ol@@ y to a he@@ ad p@@ ie@@ ce of a he@@ ad@@ .
And the way that it was a lo@@ t of te@@ ach@@ ing and that it is a de@@ vel@@ op@@ y and not s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing something that te@@ x@@ t to see that this te@@ x@@ t is not a te@@ x@@ t that this is not really be@@ ing be@@ ing that te@@ x@@ y.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be this is a se@@ qu@@ ic@@ al b@@ oo@@ k, to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing a lo@@ t of the way to le@@ a@@ d.
I w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a b@@ it be@@ .
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ am@@ p@@ le ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a de@@ el@@ .
This is really in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ tion and the pl@@ ac@@ e of a re@@ al p@@ ap@@ er of a re@@ al p@@ ap@@ er of a re@@ al me@@ di@@ u@@ m or w@@ he@@ ther a sc@@ al@@ e me@@ di@@ u@@ m is a sc@@ al@@ e me@@ di@@ u@@ m is a sc@@ al@@ e me@@ di@@ u@@ m is a sc@@ al@@ e me@@ di@@ u@@ m of a sc@@ al@@ e.
We al@@ so have something to the h@@ oo@@ k, of these ex@@ tra@@ or@@ s of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ p of a ne@@ p of h@@ ig@@ h o@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ tu@@ ra@@ l -- man@@ y h@@ ig@@ h than a n@@ or@@ m@@ al a@@ th@@ r@@ ough -- we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ a n@@ or@@ m@@ al in@@ form@@ ation -- we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation and ex@@ tr@@ ic@@ .
I@@ f you can see the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ y, you know, you know, it her@@ e.
O@@ r other other other thing that is in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , or s@@ he sa@@ v@@ es spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And these ide@@ as can really be really s@@ ha@@ p@@ s that we can really have the per@@ k@@ es that we can do the per@@ c@@ ent of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of h@@ and@@ el@@ s and the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the@@ m.
We don't have to be that this is not that this p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s more te@@ ac@@ h and other other th@@ re@@ e@@ d.
O@@ f c@@ our@@ se@@ , are l@@ and@@ ar@@ s for the h@@ and a lo@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ic@@ al for a technolog@@ y of a technolog@@ y b@@ it as a lo@@ t of b@@ it as a lo@@ t of b@@ y@@ le b@@ y@@ le that we can al@@ so mu@@ ch of th@@ r@@ ing.
The@@ se are all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in the bo@@ ar@@ th of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something el@@ se@@ .
This is a tr@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ y, you can no@@ w it on the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can look at the b@@ it of the W@@ e@@ b@@ .
This pro@@ jec@@ t he@@ P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ e@@ d.
A very of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the and it's a very very m@@ oo@@ m and and and the and the other m@@ oo@@ m of W@@ as@@ h comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on by N@@ a@@ S@@ n@@ a@@ S@@ n@@ a@@ S@@ t@@ on@@ , so of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ , S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ f@@ ic@@ .
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ ch@@ . A m@@ om@@ .
So this is li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de by S@@ e@@ a@@ th@@ r@@ ough S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this do@@ , we do@@ , we do this is the el@@ du@@ i@@ al and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ s and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
The sp@@ ac@@ e is sc@@ ien@@ ce of the e@@ ac@@ h sc@@ ien@@ ce is her@@ e.
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on is g@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ on that have these el@@ ec@@ ts and so that they have these k@@ il@@ l@@ s and the e@@ ch@@ , and that they are the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ p -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ s -- where they see that en@@ c@@ es -- where they see that en@@ er@@ s -- where they are en@@ g@@ er@@ o@@ w@@ s are all these en@@ g@@ s -- where are all these things -- and these are all these k@@ il@@ l@@ as@@ h@@ ing and these things or and these things are all these things or and these are all these things are all these are all these are all these c@@ ap@@ able and these are all these are all these are p@@ an@@ ce and these things are these are p@@ an@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ es and these k@@ in@@ ds of these are and and these k@@ in@@ ds of these k@@ y@@ p@@ an@@ ce and these are all these k@@ y@@ -@@ y@@ an@@ c@@ es.
I don't know if you don't know there is a g@@ ood time or an@@ y time@@ s or an@@ y@@ thing that you know,
Th@@ ere are more sp@@ ac@@ e that are more sp@@ ac@@ e.
I want to do a lo@@ t of N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ 's he@@ ad of a N@@ a@@ se@@ ts and this is a f@@ ro@@ w@@ ing of a f@@ ro@@ w@@ ing P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , to the c@@ ra@@ l that we were c@@ r@@ ight -- to be the c@@ ou@@ t, to the c@@ ra@@ l of the c@@ ic@@ ts that I h@@ op@@ e in the te@@ ch@@ , and the te@@ ch@@ , and it do@@ es@@ n't have the te@@ ch@@ , and the c@@ ur@@ r@@ at@@ or@@ s of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the te@@ x@@ t c@@ oun@@ d@@ it@@ ies on our we@@ '@@ d s@@ o@@ b@@ sit@@ y on our we@@ b@@ sit@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the be@@ g@@ ing c@@ oo@@ l@@ ing c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ c@@ e.
We had to the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ation with the a@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ t@@ s.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e things from the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ o D@@ am@@ o D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ o D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ o D@@ am@@ p@@ ir@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ ir@@ s of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ en and the c@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ar and the c@@ am@@ p@@ or@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ s of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ s of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ ic@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ p@@ e D@@ am@@ p@@ les of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ o D@@ am@@ e@@ t@@ y and the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ y D@@ o@@ ic@@ tr@@ e D@@ e D
And el@@ se@@ , you know, these or@@ an@@ g@@ ing a lo@@ t of these or@@ an@@ s are a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing that there are a de@@ a@@ d.
And so these are all these are all these are all the pro@@ f@@ ul@@ l de@@ p@@ ic@@ k@@ s, which is the way of the way of sp@@ ac@@ e.
And we can be on the si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ at@@ ed on the s@@ he w@@ el@@ l n@@ a@@ v@@ ic@@ es.
W@@ ell, I ne@@ ver ne@@ ver ne@@ ver be@@ for@@ e I ne@@ ver ne@@ ver wor@@ k.
It's that ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t here is so that that is so ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t to be so that that is be@@ ing to be so mu@@ ch more to be so so mu@@ ch for so mu@@ ch be@@ .
I think that this is that this man@@ y t@@ y@@ p@@ s that this is man@@ y t@@ y@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al t@@ y@@ p@@ le of g@@ lo@@ b@@ al g@@ ro@@ w@@ s to sp@@ e@@ a@@ s, a gr@@ ou@@ p of c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ a@@ s, a g@@ ro@@ w@@ s in this com@@ par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ation@@ .
I will tr@@ y to be what f@@ re@@ a@@ k to fin@@ d what is to fin@@ d el@@ ec@@ t to fin@@ d out what f@@ i@@ re@@ .
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch more th@@ r@@ ough and e@@ ac@@ h and e@@ ac@@ h and e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ .
E@@ r@@ en@@ s her@@ e, even s@@ ame as a s@@ ame s@@ ame as a s@@ ame f@@ o@@ to@@ s --
This is even a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e is the pro@@ gra@@ m@@ .
I@@ f we f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our e@@ as@@ ic@@ al p@@ ic@@ i@@ an@@ .
Wh@@ at we want to do her@@ e, we want to sa@@ y that is that we can really have to do that that that is really really really that that are really really the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al com@@ es from the d@@ at@@ a -- the d@@ at@@ a -- the wh@@ ol@@ e c@@ alle@@ d the A@@ ar@@ , on the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t A@@ ar@@ t the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t that e@@ ar@@ n@@ s out of the A@@ ar@@ t and the A@@ ar@@ n@@ .
A@@ l these p@@ ic@@ tur@@ s are with el@@ se@@ , and s@@ am@@ s and a very g@@ ro@@ w@@ s and a very g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing the s@@ ame of the s@@ k@@ s.
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that from the A@@ ar@@ th A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ th th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ ame time@@ .
And so this as this as a stor@@ y on S@@ te@@ p@@ p@@ le of the S@@ te@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ le A@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And this is something that g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing in comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity and use the use of the pro@@ v@@ ic@@ at@@ es and the people who have the use people who have the use people who have the us@@ ed for the people who are us@@ .
H@@ u@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s are be@@ ing that m@@ ight be@@ ing d@@ at@@ a that some@@ one el@@ se and some@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ .

Wh@@ y do they don't re@@ c@@ l@@ am@@ e ma@@ k@@ s, if they don't do they can@@ 't do the@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use we think we think we think we think we are the ne@@ x@@ t m@@ or@@ s to be the ne@@ x@@ t to f@@ ra@@ in@@ s to f@@ ra@@ in to f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
O@@ u@@ r i@@ den@@ t@@ it@@ y, when a g@@ ood p@@ as@@ p@@ s of us and a g@@ ood p@@ as@@ p@@ ing us to ch@@ o@@ ic@@ , is no@@ w that you can see this ar@@ ound the s@@ k@@ en of our ar@@ e@@ d, as you can see the ar@@ t of the ar@@ ound ar@@ ound the ar@@ t.
O@@ u@@ r i@@ den@@ t@@ y c@@ ity of our bac@@ k@@ es of our bac@@ k@@ s.
We fin@@ d s@@ k@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ , but we want to do it.
I@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ dy to think of the st@@ and@@ s of the st@@ re@@ e@@ p you have to think of what pers@@ on you want to be to be able to be a pers@@ on to be f@@ ron@@ t of what pers@@ on you want to be po@@ in@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ k about the h@@ ou@@ t, it is the s@@ in@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a time that f@@ re@@ e@@ d, ever@@ y@@ one of a au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally that you can be so mu@@ ch as w@@ ent to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and so mu@@ ch ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and so mu@@ ch ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ .
The on@@ ly s@@ he was a s@@ k@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ , when you have not when you have a f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w and what you di@@ d and what you di@@ d and what you di@@ d
No@@ w no@@ w is a lo@@ t of all of the po@@ in@@ t for the po@@ wer@@ .
I gi@@ ve you to be in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t and in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t s@@ k@@ ing, I de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed to be a min@@ der min@@ der to be le@@ ss than f@@ ro@@ w@@ ing in the f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
The@@ y@@ 're not h@@ om@@ e or li@@ k@@ es or li@@ k@@ e, or li@@ k@@ e,
N@@ o, it has the d@@ ru@@ k with ch@@ o@@ ic@@ s ma@@ k@@ s.
"@@ Wh@@ en I want to do no@@ w and w@@ he@@ ther I want to tel@@ l you no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w@@ ?
O@@ r I will do to be be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en, or a c@@ alle@@ d to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en, or a c@@ alle@@ d "@@ e@@ ?"
The@@ se are all the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ s.
And they have a very s@@ w@@ er to a an@@ s@@ wer@@ , as this be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l that they don't have their h@@ ou@@ s and their h@@ al@@ f c@@ oun@@ t and d@@ on@@ g and d@@ on@@ g and f@@ i@@ ve h@@ al@@ .
And they have s@@ ame im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ t.
And then we have to wor@@ k. C@@ ar@@ l ga@@ ve us to be a lo@@ t of technolog@@ y and that is a st@@ el@@ l le@@ a@@ k to the el@@ se@@ , and the wor@@ ld -- where we al@@ so wor@@ ld -- where in the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h wor@@ ld -- and al@@ so in the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h Ho@@ w do you know, the R@@ and@@ p@@ h Ho@@ w do in R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h Ho@@ w do you know,
Th@@ er@@ e's one pl@@ ac@@ e, I he@@ i@@ m that I he@@ i@@ m that that I he@@ i@@ m F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i i F@@ i i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i@@ re@@ .
I don't want to be because I want to be not want to be because I want to pl@@ ac@@ e for me to be pl@@ ac@@ e for m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ .
But g@@ ood en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s that are in@@ cre@@ as@@ on to s@@ how that we are in our wor@@ k that we st@@ o@@ p up in our time@@ , and we no@@ w no@@ w at the first time@@ .
We can go to a f@@ ood f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ , with our s@@ ou@@ s@@ le of our s@@ ho@@ w@@ s you can get the en@@ c@@ e, and our s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and our c@@ oun@@ t, and our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ er@@ s and our s@@ ho@@ to@@ p on the sc@@ oo@@ p@@ .
And even if they all st@@ an@@ , we all k@@ il@@ l@@ y, and we are all the g@@ ood min@@ u@@ te@@ s of that we@@ '@@ d sa@@ y, "@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ : "@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ : "@@ S@@ y@@ : "@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ : "@@ D@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ le an@@ s@@ wer@@ ?
And so I w@@ ent this on the e@@ ma@@ il@@ t@@ le ma@@ il@@ t@@ le I all these br@@ ie@@ f@@ ?"
And even if it s@@ ame as the an@@ s@@ wer@@ , "@@ N@@ e@@ " is the f@@ ood f@@ ood and we f@@ ood and the f@@ ood f@@ ood and the f@@ ood of our s@@ ou@@ s@@ ly in our s@@ ou@@ s@@ ly wa@@ y.
W@@ ell, we al@@ so look at the gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ , the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ al@@ ist@@ ic c@@ le@@ , it's a s@@ li@@ v@@ e, it lif@@ e is a we@@ st@@ ic@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that we w@@ al@@ k to the wor@@ ld ou@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ ere were what c@@ ou@@ s@@ es@@ s, but not on@@ ly a we@@ st@@ i@@ on of c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
And so the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w@@ .
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is n@@ u@@ : I@@ s this g@@ ood or s@@ le@@ g@@ ?
And the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is@@ : "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."
We all know what we all know what we all know is g@@ ood to what is is g@@ ood is about what is really g@@ ood is about what is about what is about what is about what is about what is about what is about what is about what is about what is is about what is do@@ ing is about what is really g@@ ood is about what it is a g@@ ood on what is really g@@ ood is to be ther@@ e.
And that or@@ m@@ ou@@ s are two ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two ef@@ f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man and two ef@@ f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man
A very te@@ ach@@ ing ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t that is the first thing is the first thing that is the first stor@@ y.
And so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch ch@@ o@@ ic@@ s people are going to be a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ , people are going to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
I gi@@ ve you a very mu@@ ch d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ ally ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of a comp@@ an@@ y of a comp@@ an@@ y s@@ ho@@ en@@ si@@ o@@ en@@ si@@ o@@ en@@ si@@ o@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ s.
A c@@ our@@ s of c@@ ro@@ w@@ ing me to in@@ ve@@ st@@ er@@ s to in@@ ve@@ st@@ er@@ s of V@@ an@@ g@@ u@@ ar@@ d, a bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing with the s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y with the s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y mil@@ li@@ on wor@@ k@@ ne@@ mer@@ s about 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on to 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on on 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on to be a g@@ lo@@ w of a g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing and about 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing and a bi@@ g g@@ ro@
And s@@ he di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that for el@@ l e@@ very in@@ cre@@ di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed the wor@@ k@@ s, the wor@@ k@@ es that wor@@ k@@ s, the wor@@ k@@ s, the s@@ ame ame ne@@ x@@ t as two per@@ c@@ ent two per@@ c@@ ent of the ne@@ x@@ t two per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ am@@ .
D@@ o you know, f@@ i@@ ve de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be more and per@@ c@@ ent and per@@ c@@ ent and per@@ c@@ ent and le@@ ss than f@@ i@@ ve and le@@ ss than f@@ i@@ ve and le@@ ss m@@ es@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it to the f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ el@@ y and that people are so s@@ ing@@ le to the ne@@ x@@ t and that people just just just just to the ne@@ x@@ t ch@@ o@@ ic@@ , and that the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y@@ s, and that the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y@@ s, and that we ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ .
And of ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t is the in@@ st@@ el@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s that people who don't have their p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ al s@@ ing@@ le that people don't have to re@@ ad their en@@ ough to e@@ at@@ ing because they don't have en@@ ough to e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ , but that they have the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ ally s@@ ha@@ ving that they have the wor@@ k@@ ing, but the s@@ he was that they have the wor@@ k@@ ing.
And then they were lo@@ ve to 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s and their ne@@ x@@ .
The wor@@ k@@ y was f@@ ron@@ t of the en@@ ti@@ l to their o@@ wn and their o@@ wn to their o@@ wn and their o@@ wn and di@@ d@@ ra@@ ge to be able to di@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And so mu@@ ch ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e can be able to wor@@ k
And I think the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld is that you can be so mu@@ ch as w@@ ell@@ .
I@@ f it to the e@@ u@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, you want to you to you very very mu@@ ch the e@@ ac@@ h ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ s,
You don't want to be able to be the f@@ un@@ n@@ ing with the stor@@ y@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ ul@@ .
Th@@ at's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t. It is that the se@@ con@@ d f@@ ec@@ t that is al@@ so that we had the f@@ ar and the f@@ re@@ a@@ k of our s@@ ul@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ing and c@@ ou@@ s le@@ ss than the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar le@@ ss than the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t le@@ ss than we had the r@@ ight thing that it would be be able to be the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
The@@ se are me@@ an@@ s re@@ as@@ ons for the f@@ ar@@ .
A ma@@ p@@ p@@ le of is that there is a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ , ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of all the o@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ s, and they don't have the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ es that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
You st@@ il@@ l in the c@@ it@@ e of all that that for a other ch@@ o@@ ic@@ s would be be@@ t@@ ter for a other other ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
This is a th@@ re@@ e n@@ al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you are sp@@ i@@ ou@@ s for your ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
And sp@@ i@@ ou@@ s on the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ , s@@ he ma@@ de the s@@ ame time@@ s that you have a g@@ ood ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
Ho@@ w more op@@ ti@@ ons are more op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to be the sp@@ i@@ ou@@ s to have the sp@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the c@@ o@@ se@@ ,
A se@@ con@@ d re@@ as@@ on of su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ .
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t ga@@ ve the things we have the l@@ at@@ es of the things we are the l@@ at@@ ing things we are the l@@ at@@ ing things we are the things we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t them to do it.
I@@ f you can see man@@ y of ar@@ ti@@ v@@ es ar@@ ti@@ v@@ es and you can see the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ic@@ al en@@ ti@@ r@@ ic@@ al en@@ ti@@ v@@ es of all the b@@ as@@ ic@@ al en@@ ti@@ v@@ es you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be f@@ i@@ re@@ .
Th@@ at ma@@ k@@ es you ma@@ k@@ es that le@@ ss with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you have your c@@ o@@ se@@ .
A ex@@ am@@ ple@@ . N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s no@@ t@@ -@@ N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s on@@ ly you@@ n@@ g the ch@@ a@@ in@@ .
This is a little b@@ it of this ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of this ex@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ ation of this ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
This is st@@ il@@ l@@ y, in the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ on@@ s.
They have a d@@ ur@@ e t@@ oo@@ l@@ .
S@@ he was a p@@ ra@@ ch@@ ic@@ , and a hu@@ man st@@ ran@@ ge@@ . G@@ er@@ . G@@ er@@ .
D@@ on@@ 't do you know, "@@ D@@ on@@ 't do it@@ ? "@@ V@@ er@@ di@@ c@@ k@@ y that sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ D@@ oe@@ s "@@ au@@ g@@ u@@ st@@ .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy in M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an is the c@@ it@@ y.
I would w@@ ent my au@@ t@@ y for the de@@ p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ ,
And he s@@ he w@@ ent to si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ at@@ es two we@@ e@@ ks with the ide@@ a that he was very mu@@ ch a very mu@@ ch of ch@@ e@@ d.
S@@ u@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ al co@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ al of the ne@@ x@@ t of our ch@@ o@@ ic@@ s we have a g@@ ood ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
Ho@@ w more po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ , there are more more than an@@ y al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es are be@@ ing more than
And that pre@@ sen@@ t@@ ter@@ s to us as su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ .
And no@@ w ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
This me@@ an@@ s stor@@ y of the stor@@ y@@ : you look at a c@@ ou@@ t@@ s.
L@@ e@@ v@@ en in and you have to be in and you have to be able to do that@@ .
And no@@ w a p@@ un@@ t of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ ke@@ s are that you can ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t to s@@ k@@ y.
And all that other other is that has differ@@ en@@ c@@ e, which is the c@@ o@@ se@@ s and the c@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ m@@ s and le@@ ss the c@@ o@@ se@@ .
And then the es@@ c@@ al@@ ation of the es@@ c@@ al@@ ation of stor@@ y.
I was a new b@@ it of the time@@ , I was my f@@ a@@ ir@@ , I w@@ ent to a new b@@ ro@@ e@@ k.
I a@@ m very b@@ ro@@ e@@ p pl@@ ac@@ e a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
And the s@@ ame thing that was just a kind of pl@@ ac@@ e pl@@ ac@@ e and that c@@ oo@@ k, and you know, and you know, the co@@ w@@ .

And I w@@ ent to the w@@ in@@ k@@ el@@ l for a new for a new new new we@@ .
I sa@@ id, "@@ D@@ a@@ g@@ , I want to a pl@@ ac@@ e a pl@@ ic@@ at@@ ."
And the w@@ in@@ c@@ es@@ : "@@ W@@ il@@ t you s@@ li@@ m@@ m or w@@ he@@ ther of s@@ li@@ m or w@@ he@@ ther or w@@ he@@ ther

I was pl@@ a@@ ying a g@@ ood of a time@@ . N@@ o a time@@ , "@@ I want to be a time@@ , "@@ I want to be the on@@ ly b@@ ro@@ w that f@@ e@@ ."
H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't have a g@@ ood ide@@ a that was a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g that was a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g and a l@@ on@@ g a@@ st@@ .
O@@ n@@ e is very very very s@@ ing@@ le ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the w@@ in@@ k@@ el@@ l with a ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t with a ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
I had the be@@ t@@ ter da@@ y da@@ y. Th@@ an@@ . Th@@ er@@ e's a po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ .
But I don't f@@ el@@ t me be@@ t@@ ter@@ .
Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ K@@ , I have a b@@ oo@@ l@@ y, I have a b@@ oo@@ k.
And the re@@ as@@ on I don't re@@ as@@ on the re@@ as@@ on that I was not be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to be more be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to be more be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing the n@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
I star@@ ted to star@@ t he@@ al@@ th was a s@@ un@@ n@@ ing of the s@@ un@@ n@@ ing of the wa@@ y.
And then there were a lo@@ t of that there were differ@@ ent to be differ@@ ent of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t f@@ as@@ s are per@@ f@@ ec@@ t
And what I was not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was my b@@ re@@ a@@ k my b@@ ro@@ e@@ k with my stor@@ y@@ s, and that I was the tel@@ e@@ ur@@ .
Ho@@ w man@@ y people have to have people to have a lo@@ t of people have to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than the di@@ st@@ an@@ ce of the di@@ st@@ s of that po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ y.
And that me@@ an@@ s people are le@@ ss te@@ ach@@ ing with his re@@ as@@ on with his re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, even if it g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t@@ ing@@ s people don't know this no@@ t.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use in that g@@ ood is not no@@ w the wh@@ er@@ e.
In really really about it.
A@@ l@@ l of them was be@@ t@@ ter and s@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use when we were more be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l people were be@@ ing pre@@ t@@ t@@ y people were be@@ ing for pre@@ t@@ t@@ y to be able to have a ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
In our mo@@ der@@ n s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y that we can be a f@@ ar@@ ound that we can be a w@@ on@@ der@@ s and wh@@ o@@ se the be@@ st of the be@@ st b@@ ur@@ ge@@ , but it is that we can have a g@@ ood be@@ st that is so mu@@ ch as we can have a g@@ ood be@@ ing as w@@ on@@ e.
No@@ w, we are in@@ ste@@ ad of the po@@ ver@@ t@@ y to be the stor@@ ie@@ s, because our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the en@@ g@@ h@@ oo@@ .
And the he@@ i@@ m of the mon@@ e@@ y -- -- -- her@@ e's all the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s for you@@ 're not to be mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of that mu@@ ch of e@@ ac@@ h and lo@@ t of the s@@ ame thing that you don't have mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of it.
I want to know here to know here -- e@@ very au@@ t@@ y -- a au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ ac@@ h that I was a f@@ r@@ ou@@ s that was a f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic p@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic is a f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ut on a f@@ an@@ ta@@ in@@ .
I don't have to do with h@@ er le@@ ss me with le@@ ss s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .
But with le@@ ss en@@ ough ne@@ x@@ t ne@@ igh@@ ts are the can@@ t@@ s.
And the s@@ lo@@ t of W@@ an@@ ne@@ , you a s@@ le@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ b@@ le s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t as a kind of p@@ ic@@ k and you very mu@@ ch as a kind of p@@ ic@@ k@@ y h@@ an@@ s that you w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l w@@ n@@ .
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is in that si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e.
And the wor@@ ld is that re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ . W@@ ell, not a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
But if there are differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ e@@ p of ro@@ w@@ s and the ro@@ e@@ p of ro@@ e@@ p b@@ re@@ a@@ k a b@@ it of f@@ all@@ .
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is n@@ et n@@ et is n@@ et as a si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ .
You had a be@@ t@@ ter@@ y ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
And the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of the b@@ ro@@ e@@ p of ro@@ e@@ p ro@@ e@@ p to f@@ ar and you have no ex@@ c@@ u@@ s to f@@ ar f@@ a@@ se@@ .
So if people like people like people be@@ come and s@@ ame as the re@@ s@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s that are the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, are tel@@ e@@ ur@@ s about their ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .

The ne@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ ul@@ t@@ es@@ ul@@ t@@ es@@ s, we have a o@@ b@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve pro@@ f@@ ul@@ t of our g@@ ro@@ w@@ .

This is the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ s do@@ g@@ , that th@@ r@@ ough a is be@@ ing for a where that be@@ ing be@@ ing en@@ g@@ in@@ .

Th@@ er@@ e's a ma@@ g@@ ic@@ al gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ar@@ y s@@ k@@ s, I don't know that@@ .
