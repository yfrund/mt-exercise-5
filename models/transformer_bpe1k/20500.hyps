And I showed these two dia's last year, I showed that the last police cap, that the last three million years of the United States of the United States was about 40 percent currents.
But this is actually the required of this particular problem because it did not the disectory of the ice of ice is not showing the dise.
The ice capach is in a certain classularly climate heart of our global climate system.
It in the winter and crack in the summer.
The next slide, I showed is a speeding version of what the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened in 25 years happened in the next slide.
The permanen-ice is dung in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blue.
That's the year, it's the winter.
And it crack in the summer.
And the famili, or five years or old or older, is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body,
In 25 years is the from this to this this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrate warms and there is a very big amount of fairly cooling carbon cooling cooling dom, when it designs in methane.
And so, the fairly referency referency in the atmosphere, that could double the amount of the atmosphere, that could double the corporate.
In some individual deep in Alaska borrelt to all of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of University of Alaska different team to another unedge.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is whether we will be able to be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge smbron" Groenland from the northous corporated from the north.
This is a smeltwaterrivi.
The water volume is real ference than ever bigger than ever bigger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuagest in South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal piece of the sea because it's country to be able to get in the sea place where it is in the sea place where it is the sea place where it is the place where the sea currently sea ference.
These streams are flight to be able to take it.
On the other side of the planet, on the South police mass the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last month orteers scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the West South Pole is very quickly fast fast fast understanding of the smellow eils.
The whole continent is six meters are six foot in six of the continue, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the size of the fix, there are new now, there are new now, there are new now, that are new now, there were new now,
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drops of the smell of the smell of the smell of the world's population is a half of the world's population of the world's population is that half of the world's population is going to get half the time.
In the Andes, this garber garber for this city.
There's more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also droppears to the drinkwater.
In California was a reduce of 40 percent in the snowing of the Sierra.
It's in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read couldn't be the predictions of it.
This worldwided dreaming dramatical dramatic stycumber of boss.
And the number of natural around the world is crossing with an incredible and never seen fast,
Four more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely invitable.
If you look at the piece of a historical context than cumber what's happening here.
In the last five years we've been inved 70 million ton CO2 hours --
25 mixes ton every day in our oceans, Come right to the eastern area of Stilled America, astruts, and every siside side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drawing of the Indian durbanish, in the oceans.
The only big caused of the Earth, naview of the Earth, which is burning for 20 percent fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of the burning of the only burnitured burnitured to the burning of the Earth, is burning of the same burnitution, which is burning fossil fuel of the burnitution, which is burrentile burner
Oil is a problem, and voice is all the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extended to China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban individual.
But we see a counter.
These are the citied carbon the bold of the building being the last years, and where grouple alternatives were forward in the last years.
There's a political stated, in the country.
The step, and oil industire gave inst ire year, 250 million dollars to promotle, which is a text-point cool --
And that imagine to do something like this.
And the chargest of the current, at me in Tennessee, four billion literally four billion literal modder.
You probably have seen in the news face.
This is the size of one after largest disinclude America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the avertist cooling around the Kerstrial, the Kerstributed around the Kerstic.
Video: "Frosty the coolman is a blank guy is a bly, up.
He is flow in America, and he he's going to be in America, and he's going to be able to grow.
Frosty the cutile of the day is being the day of the day.
He's paid and catty and cutty and corporated their job."
Here's a big part of the cities, in West Virginia from West Virginia from da.
The biggest mine work of the land is the big biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me be clearly clear. Al Gore, Nancy Reed, Don't know where they talk about."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate protection for Klimate protection.
This is a piece of it.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threating for our things.
That's why the reason why the reason is to give a gigantic concerned to reclassion to the light of the truth of the truth of truth the truth of truth of truth the truth of truth of truth is to the reason the truth of the truth is why the most import
Feits is not smartable.
We find that the small -- and it is a bit of course.
So, you don't know climate care about climate change.
Let me go to us over.
Video: Actual, Schone-coal, you have heard a lot about this.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern school cooling cities.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of lawn.
But that's the sound of sound sound sound sound sound.
And thanks the fact that burning burning cool one of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth, cools that you see all this.
Look around the cool technology is the school technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually put the positive alternative alternative alternative of national security.
Video: America wrong climate in crisis, the economy, the economy, the climate climate climate climate climate crisis.
The red wire wire of these things is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel colums, like policy.
But now there is a continue to get here.
And, America 100 percent schone electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America work on the work is a plan that we make a safer and the warming of the Earth's warming again.
Eventually a solution that is enough to solve our problems on the problems.
Repower America. Ontough head.
Al Gore: And the last stream
Video: Stem: It's going to be America is reinferenergy.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of the fast-fast, view of old field that are going to help our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good pay jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realist.
Al Gore: There's an old African accounters says, "If you want to be a quickly.
If you want to go to far again."
We need to go and far right, and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I returned to come back with a hopdate about how that works.
So here's the ones that there were not going to be there was the largest scientific experiment in the largest scientific experiment in the size of the most of the way in the surprise.
It needs to be the circumstances that were less than a billion than a billion second after the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine is under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors that I work. And this is the ATLATLATLAS detector -- 22 meters in diameters in diameters in diameters in diameters of the mini-foot in detectors of the mini-based pho
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLAS in connection.
And on the early 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That care in the control for a party cameri.
It's a picture of the first particle particle that all the LHC garound the LHC ging, and with operating the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we were saw that picture on 10 September knew that the machine works, which is a huge overwhatever a huge win.
I don't know if this is the largest biggest of course, or then, then, when somebody went to Google and saw the Internetpage.
That means that we have made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden driving these gold behavior.
That drags 13 thousand sands of 13 thousand the machine on full right now.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. They are too small being a little drawing."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superperature on all the lower temperaturs.
So on min 271 degree than the space between the stars, that can be drags that behaviors can be dragged before between the stars,
In one of the construction between the necessarily thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wire of warmer, and there was a bit of electric against 13 thousand ample ample of ample ample against 13 thousand ample ample against 13 thousand ample ample of them being 13 thousand ample ample of them and against of them against that was small, and there was a sone-once of the wirelectric against that was a thousandream of thousandandandandandrestance that were against of the against 13 th.
This was the result.
This is inpression is inpression of your realize that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeters of inches better than 20 percentimeters
We adigned about 50 magnets.
We had to do it, what we did do.
We all tool, we all tool.
Now, they're going back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will be able to put it again, and we expect to you, so that we can go to the further with the farther than the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that inhappened inhappening to the debate of the value of scientific research.
And I think it's so hard to be so hard to be able to go away that we go away to the HC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, during the device of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Farday, this is what is so dangergerous than any driving the front of the human mind is that we have no excitive in the windown, and that there are no remember that we don't have completely nature that we are completely that we disaded to be definitionsion the five in the wnate."
Thank you very much!
And I would want to start with you ask to go back to your kiddle your kiddle with blocks.
And then you discovered how to go to understand how to understand conscious problems on the learning of the decline-in-follow with the corporations.
And Ruimphone, because with the understanding of the world to understand the world to understand us.
If an information, inspired by the nast of physical interaction with objects -- sample with my advisoral interaction with my advisoration -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we were used to ask -- what if we use a computer -- what if we could use a computer information in place as a sort of digital fingertip that information moves information to a figurthere, what information with a fields.
And then the orders as we want to leave it?
This question is so decided to search a answer, that we decided to search a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort is a Sifty is an interactive computer in the size of a cookookookood.
They can be able to get up with the hand they can get each other, they can do each other, and they can be contactt.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands of blocks that can be placed by understand the block of blocks.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways,
And thought these aid are more physical different physical different and from each their movement, and even of the way we movement, and even of the way we move them movement, there are different new and like, there are different new and like.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Sift is instituded to tell a video celebrate a video games and others to play others playing cance, and othersice plays.
These interactive portraits are conscious consciousness.
And indicately each other place, they will be interests.
If they are being the countering and can be able to be able to be able to be able to become a lot of this.
And they feel movement, and helling.
We realize that one of the interesting consequences of the interesting of this interaction, the using of the interaction, as it was a color was a color was a small.
In this example three Siftable, and I can use them for them to go into a leg and I can use them to go into a leg inside a leg inside of good, where they are being in.
If we have gotten said, we go back to what it back.
There's some cleletting a few capacities for education, prety game with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things fast, and the result of trying to see things.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmic.
Here we show you a game between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a raround letter to every Siftable, and further dictioned in a dictionary dictionary words.
After about 30 seconds, it is a new series of being a new series of series of series of series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm indicated to make it out of a video of this.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things that is that people almost interesting that people almost no instructions that people nearly needed not instruction.
Everything you have to say is "Make word." And they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our youngood blobal bar, right-born.
And it seems that he just just the Siftable,
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sifty barea with that character of the table.
Here he sun.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: No he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done thic! Yeah!
And by shape of Siftables and the next to each other, he can reach the characters of the course, and the next --
DM: and so his own story telling story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open ended up with a open end.
and he decision how it walks.
Video: The catches air.
DM: The last example I will show you show you a synthesizer and live music chilstrument, that we have developed a sound sound the sound the lead, bass and bass and drum sound the bass and drum sound the bass and drum sound the drug bass and drug dropping today.
Eengineering has four variations where you can choose to use the way you want to use it.
And these sound sounds can be increated in Siftable, so that you can detern the pattern of the pattern.
You place a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leg Siftable effects that are living effects, like reverb and filter.
They are fairly advance and addition to can.
And before the general effects like tempo and completely that are pated on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a leaving a lead.
Now, I place the base line --
Video: DM: Now, I feel a bit work.
Video: And now I can buy the filter of the drums, so I can infect the effect of the effect of the effect of the drumb.
Video: DM: I can fastly accelerating the same of the temo blocks.
Video: DM: Now, I copy the filter to the filter for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can record it pattern here, while it playing.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, but I can improvise it very longer and shorter corter to do it.
And the final infinally dimmms of the full Siftly Siftly to sick left to shift the left of the full of the follow soil.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from new people, to make new people, computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are stemed on the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area design area with some possibilities that we developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the same is that this is just a very new generation to a very new generation to interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hear.
I look at it to go out with you all and talk to you all and talk to you to talk to you with all and talk to you to go to you with you with all and talk to you to go to to you all and talk to you to go to you all and talk to you to go to to you all and talk to you all and talk to you with all and talk you to go to you all and talk to you to go to to you to go to you with all and
I'm writing writing out of this.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life for a long for a long and I don't think that ever will change anything will change in the way to change that ever change.
And yet there is unlonly, something property happened in my life and career and career that I had to go up with my work with my work with my work on my work with my work and career is a disinction in my work and career and career to my work with my work with my work is unlonlononly.
And it started with a book that I did written understand a memoire, "Ets, Beinning, Beinning, is very exception to my early work and an international stated.
And the result is that people now everywherever I mean, as if I was done in the ways of the amount of that.
Do you get -- it does --
People come to me and ask me and ask to me, "Don't you know that you can event?
Don't you get your whole life is going to be able to write your whole life will be a book more a book of court?
Don't you any there?"
Ery did said, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I was right now that I was ruim 20 years ago, I was a teenam -- I was a teently wanted to become a teenad.
People said, "Don't you never get to you never get success?
Don't you get to reduce for education, you know, you can go through this?
Don't you get your life to this work is going to be able to fill your bang that there is ever going to be able to drive your broken on the puin your broken dropping your broken bitterns of falen?"
Something in that stread.
In the short comes to my answer questions that questions, "Yes."
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are called named to be called
All of the time.
But I'm also many other things that bang, you don't want to know whatever it for all this.
For instance, for instance, and other endings.
But what basically write to write myself where the last from.
Is it rational ele?
Is it logical that somebody is eight being a bang for the work for the work for the work that they were in their human being?
What is so there is so going to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the minds, something like a little bit of work on the minds, something that happens in the work of the minds.
You take my father. He was cladn't have a remember in the 40 years that there was a remember in the 40 years that he was asked to him anybody whether he didn't dang for it.
And so said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, so didn't be talking about it.
And to be fair being engineers have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reputation for manical-depressive alcolists.
Scheters wonder, who have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human beings are instability.
Look at the grimmic dotty dottal dark under the most magnifical mind of the 20th century.
And many of young, often young, often by own own own through own to do through own through own through own through own the own of own you.
And even those of those who don't have a suical fashion to be able to be able to be concerned to be able to be concerned to be concerned to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be concerned to be a suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meailer: "Meailers' myself is a piece of myself is a piece of myself is depended on the last interview for his death of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of mysel
That's prety what to say about your life work.
But of this sort of sort of exciting it up.
We all heard it before and have it before all accepted with sources all accepted it.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is involutioned with lish and that a artist, and that will lead to reach the artist,
And so I want to anyone here today is you know, you can ask with that idea life?
Do you get that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it is a prety thought about it all the way to do it all the way again.
I find it reference.
And also any dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century this century is so going to see this century --
We can creative mind much better increative minds.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for a dangerous of mind to live to the dark of the dark of life.
Someters the fase where my career in which my career now
Go one, I'm young, I'm young, amper fired years.
I can may be four decade four decade.
Home probably probably will be a little bit of the outside world as the world is that followed on that outside on that extraordinary successfull book.
And we're here with friends, so I can friends, so I can class: high sticks, highest sucess:
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think of it, you're going to think about the morning to be necessark hours to the drank.
So I don't want to this.
I love me love with the work that I love with the work I loved with the work where I loved with the work where I loved with the work where I loved with the work where I love.
The question is: "Do you know that?"
And after long after a long nam that I can only go through with writing in the processing of a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process.
I have to write a safe distance between myself between myself and my overwhole between the reactions on my futures for the reactions on my future publish publications.
I have been looking at ways found to ways doing to ways do that.
I'm in the history in history and have redeep me diship in other civilizations to see whether maybe a better way to help creative people to help creative people to get to help with the emotional complicative process.
My search has browed me browing to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Leop, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins didn't believe that creativity was going to be able to be able to be able to become in.
And the believed that creativity was a good mind of a well, who was a require, unknowledge to human being and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks named these spirit of creativity called "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demp words influence.
The Romeins had a sort of small idea.
And in them called a called creative spirit of a genius,
The funny is that the Romeins don't have a genius, a break of a particular pended of a person
In their police was a geniused a kind of magical godable, that are operating up in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work was working on the geniusion of the engine.
And the way he gave shape to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the wrong that I had the first about the earlier the results of your work.
Everyone knew how that in his work in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection to protection to a lot of narcism.
If you brilliant billiance billiance of it.
Everyone knew that was a unseen that a unseen that you had heald a lot of genius.
You work in the way, you work doesn't just get a bit of you.
Everyone knew that you had a pretty inhigh-did genius.
Lang time is that had been created to the Westen creativity was considered to the Westen creativity was considered to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There's a very new idea: the individual human being is the individual human beings is the averse and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacking from the goddouble world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity came out of the individual came out of the individual came to it.
And for the first time in history was the history was artists said that they were said that they were not a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big failed.
And to one person a person, one person single individual individual believe that he whether it's essentially essentially the essential mystery, of all the good thing is a lot to be able to famil, creative and the known forward for a fragial human psyche.
And, if you ask somebody question in sun.
Egotten are blowing up to gigantic proportune and incredible increating exprestations to exprestations of prestations and exprestations
And I think this drug the last 500 years a lot of artists capot has made a lot of artists deced.
If that is, and I think, is the question: "What now is that?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to a older of the relationship between the relationship between human being?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years of rational humanism not unfortune in a 18 minutes of the 18 minutes of the type of the way we can did 500 years of rational might not be individual.
And probably there are in the audience, people who are tributting tools have been talking about the idea that edge of the idea that edges with some feedges to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspirating high teaching high teaching heights.
It seems to me, you don't get you get all of that.
And I wonder it well.
Why not?
Why would we don't should we have thought that thought to next?
It's like a lot of wrong as much as much as a lot of explanations that decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everyone who has a little bit has trying to create something -- so in fact -- so in fact -- you know that the creative process -- you know that the creative process is not always rational process --
That sometimes like almost paranoral,
I have unled the great American closer Ruth Stone Stone of Ruth Stone Stone of Ruth Stone of the great American directly.
She is close. Her whole lives in the next.
She told me about her jeudge on Virginia.
Somes, if she was field, they felt a poem she was a close to country.
It was said, "Well, there was a big wave wave air, a big wave air.
And so, a poem golf than the country to her the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, under her feet, and she was that her on that moment but one thing about one thing about one thing that was going to stonly one thing about a this:
And she went home, followed by the poem and she had to see so fast as fast as quickly as quickly as well.
And when the close of her her close was golvice that was her only shape to write it on the write of the write of her so.
Sometimes she didn't fast fast enough.
And then right and running and running it doesn't reach.
And in the moments close moments of her close of the fields, on the field -- in heard in the words -- in the words -- in the words --
And so there were once -- this find I think of the beautiful part of the story -- that they find the close -- that they have the close to the close mistake.
And then she was in houseek to search and paper and paper the close by her head.
Juist on that moment she had a potill she had a potill of packs.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me to the air.
She picked it into his tail and put it back in her body in her body in her body write the written write the written
In those cases came out of the closed wonderfull in paper and piece of paper and followed following in the case of piece.
When I heard that heard -- what happened to happen to be able to be able to my creative process!
So my creative process is not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a musile, who are every day on the same time, and the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating with blood, and trans down.
But even in that day equired I have a experience of experience in that day.
You can also know it to know it is a broads, that feel that there are creative ideas in your burrels from a sources that you can impossible.
What is that then does that being burn?
How can we use it without that without that we are being that?
One way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a while.
We had the store of this.
And in fact, a big part of his life had been a big part of his life of the amazing of the amazing artists that try to get ineer in the unfortable creative impulses that inevitable,
And the years, the years, the years was Tom what small right away.
And one day he was in Los Angeles, and changed the fast, and changed the process.
And as he was so real, he heard a fragmental die.
The decided to him, like inspiration that is does understand understand corporator.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to vasthing.
But it didn't really wrong.
He had no paper type, no taperiod of a tany basically.
And the amazing exciting exciting the exciting of the melody cate, and then it turns me the melody reflect me to follow it again.
I'm not good enough enough, I can't do it right."
He was not real real process in panic, but he stop that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry hear, you don't see that I behind the whether the wireless of the air?"
"Do you really think I can real a song you can write a song of song you a song of song you a song that you can get a song of song that I can describe a song of a song of song?
If you really want to get that this song you have to get later again, if I have time for you.
Now, you know, somebody else -- nobody else.
Ga neighborhoods, in Leonar." And from that she losed the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonar."
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar dark of dark understanding dark of the same dark of the same dark of the same daround is familiar dark is the same thing.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him called the creative process of geniused to the enjoy of genius.
The geniuses to close and close close and livered only close to the skin and liver.
And to realize that there was no reason to go through through through to go through through through through to go through through through to go through through to go through to realize that there was no reason to go through it.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre society, a sort of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that not all the way from Tom himself was not very much of Tom himself was a wonderfull of Tom and the own diaspec
That story has changed my way of work has changed.
I've been profit from there.
I was in the middle of Etts, Biddy, Biddle of Eten, Beil.
And I think in a currenty in a spir.
You know that well, you know, you don't want to work good and you think it's a terrible disast. The book is a terrible book.
Not someer bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bood.
I wanted to do all the project of the project of this.
And then I remember Tom that Tom that corporion, and I decided to be a point to be a piece of point to be a piece of point to his genius, and I decided to be a piece of course, and I decided to be a p
I wish from my manuscript and I mean to me to a leave to a legal camer.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all know this, we know all of this book is not just book, it's not just by me.
You can see I have all in the stop in the stop I have in the stop in me.
More can't give it.
If you find that it better can, you have to do this.
Snap you don't know that? Do you don't know you, right?
I just write down, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notults are away to be able to be able to be a can't be a changed."
Tja--- Unity, the Unities,
Euwing around the North African desert African desert people to dance in the North African destining music.
And then hours and hours, to the morning, to the morning.
That was amazing because the dancers were completely professionals.
But something, very much happened to be something like to happen to be a particular this.
One of that dancers was transcendent.
You know what I'm going to know is what I mean, you have also done in a performer.
It was like the time still still and the dance of the stape of a bit of stape on the stape of the time.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights of nights together.
And suddenly he didn't read a human beings.
In him, under him, found him glourselves this.
A good fired down through fired him.
If such a distine, knew people who started to claps and clapping in class and claps: "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact that was a lot of Moren SSSSSSpanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanist of the womin.
The multiply is real real reference of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, Ol, other."
That least today is the day in the day of died.
If an artist, in Spanare something inability, or magical does, "Allah, On, old again, Allah, again, broad."
One see, sick, sick, sick, a glimb of God.
Precion what we need to need.
Last, is real real that the next morning to the next morning to the follow that he did not a good charge of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning.
And at that moment is he again, a little bit of parently again, that maybe never to be more to zulk to be coming to zull more to be able to be able to coming to be more early to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of edgetting a little bit of either than an
Maybe never going to be anyone God anybody dance, dance, dance.
What to now is to rest of his life?
That's hard to it.
That's really hard to continue for a creative mind.
But so painful need to be able to be able to be able to be not need to be able to be able to be able to be.
Imagine not going to be able to get out of your extraordinary aspects of your person coming out of yourself.
Imagine you believe you a while, you have a while, you have a whiled of a not nather than a nather than a nather.
When you get there to clow there are ready closely different in the world
And so it protects everything.
I put inside the average of thought to it.
The last months I've been working on a book that book will be able to go into a lot of the book where much long reach long reach long is outcoming to the last months.
The follower of that illustraters.
And if my thoughts to me the hold of the hold of the same thing that was going to be the same for, and not bang.
Don't just the work.
Bline, just just your doing, what's the affect of you do this, what's it is.
If you came to dance is to dance.
If the godarban geniused is to decide in your work on one in your work on one in your work on one of the wonderful source, then "Ol.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole bot!
You know, I had a couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can meaning that can mean of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the digital code biology to the digital code to digital code to go to a new fase in biology in biology in biology in biology to design synthetic life.
So we've tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think of biologists tried to understand to understand in different levels on different levels on different level.
We have different approached in different approached to learning to miniimize components.
We're now going to be 20 years to the digitalize it.
And when we have sequency the human genome ced, it went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask anyway, can we try to live new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a sort of that can be able to move in a laboratory laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can get a smaller genome.
We can go into the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so, who are there in the around of the 500 or so.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relative simple with the onzero.
And so so this is simply simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at a living cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell of calive.
We decided to cure that the only route prety that was to be able to synthetic so that we could deployed the components to be able to ask the components to ask the couple of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic thet?"
Do the chemistry the chemistry that we never have seen before we never have seen before?
And, if we do that, can be a chromosome of starte?
A chromosome of chromosome of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of the digitalize of life is accelerating exponential decade.
Our ability to write the genetic code of lose slowly, but is incredicine.
And our last point would be on this moment to this moment on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of clothical city, to start with a bio-ethical tsing form of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to DNA very hard is.
There's a thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in lengineer, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it fails of the world are more folks of this.
So we had to make a new method for the small pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the fails.
And this was our first power, to start with the digital information of the genome of genome Phi X174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the bareas --
and DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we started to piece of chemical stopping chemical stopping the genetic code genetic code genetic code and viral particles in the bacteria particles of goods.
The viral particles were sold to get out of cells, they came out of cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unleft in the conversation of oil industry, and I said that she said that model but all the good snapprivate.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which the software heard ware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger bigger ones.
We wanted to get the full bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so that we could figure out the cassetttes, so that we could figure out the cassettts.
to understand what the real components of a living cell components of a living cell
The design is critical information in the computer than the digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than it is very accurame.
And when we first first called this genome called the standard in 1995 was the standard precision one per 10,000 baseparats.
And finally we found after 30 following 30 folates. And if we had the original sequence of the original sequency of the original sequence.
And the design is design the design of pieces that are 50 letters long over the other pieces of the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-b-sub-b-byclothing.
We design unique subjects.
Maybe you read to you read water now we have water now in stop.
And think, we have a square genetic genetic code: A, C, C,
Trios of those letters of code for back for back for back -- that there is a only lettery clearning for every aminozue.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to writing though.
And really, what we did it is a mom.
Some were calling close to be directly there were no closed to it.
We have designed these pieces that we can design them with answell.
There are enzyms that they repair and in each other.
And we started to make pieces that five to 7,000 letters of five to 7,000 letters long and you have piece of 24,000 letter, understand you have set up to 72.000.
And in every cities we have a confidence of these pieces so that we could sequences that we could create a process that is very robuobust -- that's going to be very robuobust -- that's going to see that you'll see the stread.
We try to achieve the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketbal.
And as we come to the big pieces -- more than 1000,000 baseparal -- then they don't grow easy in E.
And that wells the experience of all the modern of modern molecular biology.
And so we went to say to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists that is used by the biologists that is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair and corners.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million rad to straling to the same to stralize on can.
And you see in the top paneal, she just clear, she just clear.
12 hours later later put it in each other, exactly like the first time.
There's thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dreamed to be completely dread.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know very much of certain the space can find in space that can find it in space that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has truly to show that there is a lot of it, there's a lot of this.
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- actually mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right designs that we were down.
Gergs that she is automatically said automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a commicroscope photo.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we were outside.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of molecule of people, with a clearly structure.
The moleculecuulght is more than 300 million.
If we would have the presses with a 10-points letter, without space, there is 142 pages of the genetic code age of the genetic code away.
Good, how do we start a chromospher? How do we started to it?
And a virus is clearly easy easily.
And a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you get your corporate undereukaryots, like we just walking the cell cell cell of them and it is what you know if it clone.
And the bacteria of the bacteria of integrated in the cell but we have showed that we have a full transplant to a full transplantation of a chromosome of cell to another or to another other cell to another and it can active.
We have a chromosphered of a micromospeed of a microbbenefits of a microbbone.
These are about so far away from each other far and mice.
We found extra genes extra genes so that we could take for this chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of the cromosome of the cromosome extra to be able to figure out of this chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosphere.
We have the teached with enzyms to make all the eggs.
It was very sensational pictured when we can put this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromosome of cell.
We even thought he would come to sover to sover the process to develop the process of developing processing out of developing to develop the process.
This is an essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of third somewhere, which they are thousands of property thousands of property in one times of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of course.
People evolution evolution evolution to change a lot of biology not have a lot of biology does not a lot of biology does not have a lot of biology that evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution to evolution evolution evolution to be evolution to be evolution as if there are one of the way or there.
There's enzyms that are restriction enzyms that actually actually DNA red that actually DNA red the real.
The chromosome of the cell has not ever earned in the cell of the cell that in the cell of the cell that in the cell cell that in the cell cell that in the cell that in the cell that in the cell that in the cell that in the cell that in the cell cell that in the cell cell that in the cell that in the cell that was not ear.
The cell -- the chromosome of it in it -- well.
It was expression, and the recognize the other chromosome of chromosome of material, and why we had the cell with the new chromosome of cell with the new chromosphere, and we had the cell chromosphere,
He was blue from the genes that we had stop in it in it that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristic of the corporates of the new species of the new species of based on the new software that we in the cell that we had in the cell of the cell that we had stopped in the cell of the cell of the new software stopped in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the corportune of the new kind of the corporate of the new kind of the corportunitorial cle of the new species of the cer
All the way changes changed the genetic code -- when we changed the genetic code -- the genetic code in which it was changed.
This may be county as genomical alchemist, but we're in state, by the change of the software DNA, to change things
Good, I have earlier before this is not a skull, this is not a little barea -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camburical exploiting that there are big scale, based on this digital exploital species that there are big in this digital designs of the digital design.
Why would you do?
And I think it's free clearly if you look at what it is now.
We go inside of six-endors of six--on-half to 9-billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to my context in my context place: I'm born in 1946.
There's three people on this planets.
every of us that affect in 1946, in 1946, that there will be four four before.
We have a food with food, with food, with the corners of clean water, drug drug for the six--on-half billion.
That's going to be did to do that.
We use five billion toncolles, more than 30 billion collectone.
That's 100 milos a day.
And when we take biological processes in ogencous process to replace that to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is that coming up in the atmosphere is that cool.
And though our worldwide, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see a database with the future, and I would like to see the future.
The electronics industry had a dozero had a dozero -- look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We are pretty concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques fast, faster synthesize that called combinations to do called combinative.
We now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes or tried to reach processes or trying to make octans to make octan, or drugs to producing octan, we can produce with a small tines, we can do with a small molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select for life vatable to be able to be able to fix, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen imagination of what real design, so you can get to work on the gang and a new species on the computer, and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We now founds, now fourth generation of fourth generation
One of you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are inside the fixes will come out from sugar, to more high-fill fuel of butanol.
But the only way we think biology that biology biology without the food price without the food price of foods, and the availability is that we start with CO2 as his foods, and we think that are foods, and we think that we are understanding the first fourth cells that we are doing the first fourth generation in the way in communits inside about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered the world, we've all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles deep squeekly showing to show.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen of molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We can take it or we can take care of CO2 mes, which is easy corporated to go to fabried to fabries, where that CO2 is that CO2 is to currently to sture this process.
So in a short time, we think we are in a short-basic question: "What's living on the basic question: What's life?"
We actually have a real, you know, the describes describes the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. If you don't do this, where you can't do this?
A major energy source.
But we are now using these works, are now going to use faster series of series of series of series of series of works.
This year was there the flu was just going to walways behind the facts of the flating comes on the right now on the right now.
And I think that can change by affective combined vaccines.
Here you see how the future of the future of evolution boom now is going to change the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually evolution to eventually eventually evolution to get the future of evolution that the future of evolution that the future of evolution that the futur
We are affected from the improve improve of people.
Our goal is very much to survive a chance that we make a chance to survive long enough to do that.
What I'm going to show you is fast fast fast fundament of a new technology that we have to get a conversal to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedgeon.
And it's a vironment in which you can get local or on the immense amount of visual data can work on the field of data can work in which you can work in the environments.
We look at this many gigabytes of digital images and can naked up in the moments and then declassons, and the sort of course, and the sort of course.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at these collections or images or images are images or images or images are going to be looking at these collections or images are not from how much information.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of the Library of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixal.
It all does nothing from because the only thing would be affected to affect influence, on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen on the screen of the screen is at the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen system, the amount of the screen of the screen of the screen in
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image of not-image of not?
This is the graum of Dickens. Every collect is a headdition is a head.
And to prove that it's really too, and not a picture, and not picture, to show you that this really text is not a picture, this is not imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book.
I wouldn't get it to this.
This is a realistician. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every big picture, is the beginning of a party.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper age, whether whether whether whether whether is a scaling medium.
We also have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a need advertised from high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise -- and we have extra normal information -- and we have extra normal information --
If you want to see the ability of these car seat, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to do sure that we can really do the limits of accountering the limits of accorporate the screen of act that is the limity.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other thing.
Of course, of course, for a bunch of the hand general piece for a technology like this, I don't spent time to spending this field that we can be lots of this fields.
These are all the away in the U.S.
And the picture, on the picture.
Now, let's look different.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the wire of the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques two techniques each other connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice computer vision of Washington, by Noah Snah Snavely, promove by the University of Washington, beautiful by Seitz U.Washington, beautiful,
and Rick Smseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragond.
And when we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the pictures has meaning here.
The computers have been familithms have been brained to these images so that they come up with the real space -- the Grassed Lakes in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are genomes.
I don't know sure whether there is a different time is a different environments of time.
There are lots of space there are lots of space there.
And I want to like to get one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynthesis that we were working -- to the communicate that I have in my head of the real force of this technique of technique of these technique of environments on our website.
We had to love the advocaturious encount of advocates.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Daame with Flickr. You seech in Flickr. Now, Dake in Flickr, and you get imagine of people in too, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and suddens.
And every of these orange chain, a picture of this model of the model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of the orange of the orange of this orange of orange is a picture of this orange basically increated to be part of this model of orange every much of orange each of the orange of orange of the orange of this orange of oran.
And so are all Flickle Flickr imaginations, who are copped in these way space basically basically copped in these way of piece.
And we can close simple wish navigate.
I had never thought I had thought I had ever thought I would work at Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft.
It's conversation to be so found here so happened to be so found this.
I believe you can see that these many types are many types of good cameras, everything of glex, a big number of thing, say, a big number of this,
I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so much of through faces and suddenly it.
And the whole between this is a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is good chained, by the program.
If we five the poster in due, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say is that we can really do with social environment. This uses the data -- from the whole collective memory of hills of hold in the social paper -- and copy the other.
All these pictures are with each other is big, and shape a little bigger than the single of the sings.
You have a model that from the entire Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth is a model of the whole Earth is a model of the whole Earth of the whole Earth is a model that from the entire Earth of the entire Earth of the whole Earth is the entire Earth of the entire Earth.
And so, this as a result on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it use the uses of the front of the benefits for the people who are using using it.
Their own pictures are pretty driving metapher data who are inferde.
If anybody would like to attack all these slights, and their names, and inputting their names, and then the corporate of the Notre Dast, and I can use the access to that does space that metaphold to that space a sort of course, used to this is a kind of course modal, and creating a kind of cross-modal, and created social social experience.
And of course, is the conduct of a imments, is a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from air, who only not only from aircular photos, and other pictures is dionth other.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the pictures that are deviolence on the world can be able to copp?
BAA: Yes. What is really does this really doesn't do that.
The creates clear, hyperleft left in the long left of imaginations.
And the base of the data in the pictures.
And that is designing spanning when you think about the riches of the riches of semantic information why mantical information why is a lot of these images.
And when you look for the web looks for imagine, you can see a search in, and the text on the web page, and the text of the web page, a lot of information about what the imagina is far information about what the imagina is far information about what the image,
Now, what if you pick the images is all your picture?
Then the number of subjecty semantic connections and the amount of right now that comes from the classic networkeffect.

I want to talk to you about some questions, I want to talk to a book a book of book a book of book for a book of book that I have a book of a book that I want to talk to you about some questions.
Maybe you see parallels with information from other sources.
And I try to explain a little bit of connecting you may be mistaking you mist.
And I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the agma of all the Western several age, industrialized society.
And that official dogma ludgma lucks, to get the amazing of our neighbors on the highest level, we need to get them so much as much as possible individual free to give them as much as possible follow.
Freedom is a big good is a big, a essential part of the human exist.
And then freedoms freedom to act higher insight, to reach a higher amazing a higher amazing without inment.
The ultimate freedom freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedomness, automatically more amazing more amazing.
This is so deep early in our society that nobody would have done in our society.
And so in our lives is this dogma bit of course.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A big.

No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that don't do a lot of it.
And also in aspects of the adapted of the muscle of mults, is this explosive inside of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of the same of the disincluding of the dismall of the course, is this explosive insive including the same of the spull of the muscuded to be a few of the spull of the spular of the aspects of the cortance.
Starhealth care -- it's in the United States not so you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you should do.
No, you go to doctor, and that says thought, "We can do that, we can do it.
And, and a reason this off.
There's this object, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is does do you fine?"
And the doctor, "As has this off, and DDo has this off.
What do do do do do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do was you was, if you was you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And that now we call the patients of the patient."
That is very positive, but means in fact that the sware task of decision of the sware slightly with business -- the doctors -- the doctore -- someone who has a free certainly sick and not the best contained to take decisions.
Good protect that ners, because the purpose group, because the purpo, you can't buy it.
Why do do do do do do we copents, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning to ask our doctors to ask that other notice to ask that other notice that other notice that other notice that other notice that other notic.
And our idents, yet a single aspect of us exists in the world is now conversation on this slight of choices, like you can see on this slight on this slight of decorporating on this slide.
Our identity is going to be lots of our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we can only want to do it.
Everybody in the morning of the early one of you want to be thinking what for person you want to be you.
Let's talk about the skin again.
There's a time that freedom, everyone automatically from the fast fast as quickly as quickly as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as fast as well.
The only realized choice was with whether and what you did you did do.
Now, freedoms all for the opening for the opening of it.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I developed 20 percent less house, and I wondered to develop than early wonder.
They don't have dam, or airly dominated or airly time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Well, I said, whether not?
Or will I wait to wait? Neam I first first children, or a care?"
These are all set of these are all single questions.
They are going to have a answer this, also that they don't have a good deploy-work and there's no good currently doubt of their homework and not a good clear.
And they have right. These are important life questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just gave to work. Carl gave to work every minute every day of every day -- capable to work -- capable to world -- except in the Randolph How does
There's a place, I think I love secret mean, where WiFi the go.
I don't follow because I want to keep for me.
But good, that huge choice freedoms of work in that we are going to be able to go and questions, or now wer on the wrong time, or now whether we're going to works.
We can look at a footbalwiddle of our son one side with us cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they were all from standing out of the worse of that affect of that affect with all kinds of that affect with all kinds of the affairlfairly answer?
And I reach this emailtary? And I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" experience we found the footbalwish of our son a very different ways.
And where we look at it, the big, the small, the small, materialist of life is a question: life is a questions.
And so the world there was early looking at the world there.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a questions.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad win?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects,
A very fix-fixed effect is that the earlier before basically basically than currency.
And so many choice possibilities people to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice choice of choice as much choice as much choice as much choice possibilities.
I give you a very dramatical example of investiguous pensive investments in free plans.
A colleaguard of me came to investment to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society of Vanguard with about 2.000 fewing a million corporates.
And she discovered that for every decade, the work fundred the works, the particular is the particular two percent death.
And in fififififififive five five five five five five five five five five drim?
Because it in fififififififififififififififified to the next day, and so on.
And of the still comes away.
That means not only that people after their pensioner pensionate because they don't have a dream to eat, but also the choice of choice that the choice of the work of the work of them for the work of them for the working.
And that she walked to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose before walking on their nose before to go to the fix.
The worked far was namely to double their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contributed to double their own contributed to double.
So a lot of choice can work on a lot of choice can work on the flamilion.
And I think the world there is so looking at the world there.
If it to eterness the century to early the right choice makes the right choice makes, right?
You don't want to be capited to fundress the wrong thing, or even the wrong three or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the average of us is that we did the affect of us and choose each text with the result of the result of the result of the resulty of the results.
There are member reasons for for that.
One of the choice, for instance, for example, for example, in the back to the choice that was not perfect perfect the choice was not perfectly perfect of the choice,
You can stop in such a case for that another choice that would be better.
This picked alternative square that you get to get the speak of your choice.
And then does break on the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you had a good choice was a good choice that was a good choice that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice that you had made a good choice of the follow.
And the more options of them are easily easy to have the speak of increating every early of early evil.
Second reason has a substitutive.
Dan Gilbert gave from the morning of how often we depended the value of things we depended them to compared them.
If you can invent many alternative, you can already already the attractives of all the alternatives that you wisdown.
That is that you have less tevalent with the alternative that you have cooks.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a bit of the stretches of this example.
This is a bit of vavavailions.
They have a little bit second wound.
They are a wonderful beautiful beautiful again.
Don't you might not? "Do clockie," thinks that man, "It's augh.
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of city.
I could put my car flack for the door."
And he is there two weeks to simply ayes, with the idea that he was a great parking of parking parking of parking parking of parking mislegal parking mission of the idea that is a great parking of the idea that he is wonderful every day of the idea that he is a great parking of the simultiply of two weeks.
Substitutives are going to go to fixe of our choice that we have a great choice of our choice choice of the follow choice of the following choice that we have a great choice that we have a great choice of the following of our choices of fix.
And the more opportunities are more opportunities are alternative.
And those presenting presenting us as substitutives.
Another example.
This picture, you know, picture.
Life in the here and now is that you don't have to continue to the affect of this.
And one point is that you get with every choices of choices out.
And all that other has so his attractious can't be able to get less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this during during my search a new brow.
I always wireless is always spired to the brow.
And the fairly one kind of speak of a speak and that cows your thane. It was not a bit of the past, it was incredibly unny enough the browing and often the browing and often the browing OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new one.
And I said, "Dag, I want to say, this is my meet, this is my mee."
And the storeasy said, "Wilt you smart smart or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to fit or relaxed to be fit or relaxed to fit is clear, easy fit or relaxed to fit is clearning f
Do you whether a ritis? Do you stone?
Do you have a broken with slide?
Will you go out out something expensive pipe, or fly." And so he walked down.
I was speake. I was going to say, "I want to say, I want to say, "I want to go and said, "I want to was."
He had no idea was that was a broke of a broke up, and so I have a hour-browing browing up and so I have a hour.
And I mean, I left the wink of windown, with a browing passing brow.
I had better day. And I had better. I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Because this is to explain the myself, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better fellow with all that choice was that I started to expect to expect of a good speaking more good speaking of a good speaking.
I started without any expection, because I was just knowing one sort of a disperate.
And then then then that there were different to be different to be a deal, and one third of the perfectly perfectly
And what I was bought to be good, but not perfect.
And so I was a browing my browing expectations, and that still me told me that stalk me told me that I was told me to me.
The more opportunities people have did expectations of the services of the services of the opportunities.
And that means are less texty are less texts, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case you don't have anything I'm talking about.
In really it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad and people were prety surprising experiences.
In our modern society of citizens can reach citizens expection, but the best thing that we can achieve ever expected is that something so good as well.
Never we get await to be surprise, because our expections, my expectations, torentire expectation.
The secret of happiness -- here's all the same thing -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is not to expected a lot of happiness.
I want to stop here -- I want to get a car biographical elemental -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic bary fantastic bards.
I didn't have a lot of texty with her trip.
But with less enough less enough his good can.
And finally, Wan, you know, when you get a bad bad bad bad bad bad books like one kind of a bad of fun, you can ask your wonder why you are untexty intevitable.
The answer is that in that case simply is simply simple.
The world is responsible ad. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy choop, and you buy choops that turns out to fall the against of the responsible of the against of the availability, why is the responsible of different brows.
The answer is just so simple.
You had a better choice choice choice can make it.
With hundreds of different browing browing excus.
So if people decisions, even though the results of those cludes are good good at the results of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves themselves.
In the western society squarters clinical depression of the young generations of the young generations
A factor -- not the one, but a significance, but a significancy of depression of depression of depression and self-moord, is that people like to have their high experiences of their high experiences.
And then they try to explain the county themselves themselves themselves the sculping well.
So the ntoresulate is that we have objective on the front of good and so fellow our bad bad of well.
And so a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where it's being everybody for where it's being for where it's done for where everybody.
But that's not.
It seems not choose that can't choose better than not choose to choose it is not cools automatically that is more choice is that more choice is better than the automatically better.
There's a magic founds, I don't know any mixical founds.
But I know that we already along for the point that choice freedom that choice is that choice free that choice is that choice for a long time.
Now, there is a principle -- I'm almost country -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can stop the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can keep us.
The choice freedom in industrialized countries from material overfishing countries to flow from material overfollow.
There's a lot of places on the world, we've heard earlier to be very much choice is that there is a lot of choice is to lots of choice is to love choice is.
So the paradox I mean, you know, the familiar for the moderneat, wheels of the modern,
That's frustrated, and this is frustrating and said to the same through that dure and told that dure and installing childrzyling kids not help.
I say the same thing about this dure, infull choices -- they don't help choices -- and not helping them.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society of choices to make all those choices people have to have a little bit of the choices of the people are going to figure out of it.
And so so we live to figure out of it.
That's what economists economists call the economists.
Everyone is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have with our freedom.
And then finally, you know, if you read this picture, you're like, you're going to say, "Ach, what are you say, "Ach, what does do you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A writal imagination, a short-a-mazing global picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the way I started to better that this fish is that this fish smart is smart smart is smart smart is smart smart is smart smart is that this fish, I did it is a smart smart is that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you courage the fishing to create possibilities, but lambirthese, but locking.
If you get the vision to create potential to create possibilities, you get less texts.
It lead to more lost to more lobal disape and less textility.
Everyone has a visual sense of fish.
This is free very certainly certainly -- it's a certainly for us.
But the way of figured vision is figured vision is questions, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
