And I showed these two slide of slide that the police cap, that the last three million years of the last three million years of the United States of the U.S. with 40 percent fent currently.
But this is actually the really, the research of this specific problem because it doesn't the disect of the ice of the ice.
The ice capacity on the North Pole, in a sense, in a climate system.
It was in the winter and crace and crymer in the summer.
The next slide, I shows is a very single version of what happens is 25 years happened in 25 years of what happened is happened in 25 years of what happens.
The permanent ice is didly in rood.
As you see, it looks at darkerblaw.
That's the yearal ice of the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The called permanens five years or older, is almost like blood, is almost like blood, that is the flower, which is flowered here.
In 25 years is it from this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Iceless Icountry and there is a very great amount of frozen carbon captured carbon cattle, when it is designed by microbed by microbe,
And the reinfling corner in the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, that would double the amount of the atmosphere.
In some increase deep in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
As the last winter went down Professor Katey Walter of Alaska with another team to another team to another undeep me.
Whoo! OK. The question is real real or we will be wrong.
An saving a reason is that this huge "warmbron" Greenland from the north.

If you want to know how the sea leglass because it is the landics of country, this is the place where it comes in the sea legs.
These streams are flightly flight.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the south mass the biggest ice mass on Earth.
As the months maand a month reported that the whole continent now a negative ical balance.
More specific is in the ice of the South Pole, very quickly faster every qual distrial faster eating through some of the islands.
The whole continent of six meters are sea legisling around the continent.
In the Himalaya, the two after the greatest ice mass, there are new now, there are new now, that are new now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinkwater of that smels.
In the Andes, is this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappear, it is the drinking water.
In California was a further of 40 percent in the snowpak of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reading the predictions needle.
This global dreamed dreamatic dreamatic stycumbers.
And the number of natural currenced with an incredible and never seedly speedy.
Four time more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the last 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 entire advanced every 24 hours.
25 mixed ton every day in our oceans, good to the east area of Stille, from America, from America, awest, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drager drapid in the oceans.
The only great caused of the Earth, next to the Earth, next to 20 percent fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stonly the problem, it's all the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extenaned chain the rooms with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urbing centers to build a lot more urbing center.
But we see a course.
This is the urban central centrals, which was the building was annulearned in the last years, and where green alternatives and where green alternatives were presented to be the last years.
There's a political state, in our country.
The urban carbon-industify gave industify decade of scaled from "scal" clearning cool to promots, which is a generstical -- which is a generate.
And that picture to something like this.

Fantastic! The machines make a lot of law.
But that's the sound of sonist clean technology.

But now there is a durfly, new solution to get out of this.
America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 percent clean.
A plan to get America to work again, a plan that is safer and the opwarming of the Earth counter, and the opinion of the Earth.
And it is a solution that is a solution that is to solve our problems.

Stem: Repower America. Tich, to become realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speaking that says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go far far to go far far again."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hopdate about how that works.
So here's me. For the ones that there were not the LHC is the most scientific experiment experiment experiment ever understanding understanding of the miment of the miles in early 27 kilometers.
It needs to the conditional that were necessarily that were being less than a billion second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition, thus!
This is the machine under Gengine.
We took photographs of that mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the once I work. It's the one I work. It's called the ATLS detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photography of ATLAS.
On 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That made for a party in the controlle-cameri.
It's a picture of the first particle that is all around the LHC went around the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, with a piece of the LHC, and particles in the detector.
In other words, when we knew that photograph on 10 September that the machine works that the machine works is a huge overfish.
I don't know if this is the biggest the biggest rate, or then, when somebody went to Google, and saw the Internet page and saw the Internet page so from the Internet page.
That means that we have a both a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which makes it with these golden wears.
That behaviors 13 thousand amper that the machine on full full working down full in full power to the full of the power on full rights,
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small the way that they're too small bed."
They can do because they do that because they superated on all the low temperaturs.
So at multiple of 271 degreement, the global stars, that can draw drags that draws that counters.
In one of the construction between nets in the nets in the LHC, sat the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wirelectric reflection was increating the electric weather against that 13 thousand amper that are 13 thousand amper that was a thousand amper that was the same thousand ample of electric refree and then it was a thousand ample of electric restantly thousand ample that was the room of electric resources that was the right?
This was the result.
This is another inpressing when you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons, and they were about 20 percentimeters were going to take about 30 centimeter.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will be able to put it again, and we expect measured to measure, so we can go further with the except what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, that have the unhappening in the value of science, the value of science. It's easily.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard is that we go further than ever beyond beyond the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did defenceed, I did define experiments of his teachers of his learning was Michael Farael Farael Farael of the human mind than to take our images of the human mind than to take our images of science, and we are not completely that we are not completely in the working in the nature that we are completely that we did that we dievisionsions."
Thank you!
I would like to start to ask to your childhood to your childhood when you played with block with blocks.
When you discovered how you to understand how to figure out and away, it was actually problems to solve the problems of space with and depended with and depended with and depended with space relationships.
Ruimtell is insight is strong because it is the strong to the world to understand us.
If an information -- inspired by the nurture of physical interaction with objects -- sample with my advisure Pattion and my medepends with my advisore -- I started to ask -- what if we were a computer -- what if we were used to be a computer of that entimous as a kind of a kind of a plating finger as a kind of digital fingeration with a plating finger reauthoration of information with a platating flating fy-broad,
and can we orders like we want to leave it?
This question is so concerned us so concluded an answer to search an answer by Siftables.
Cort together is a Sift a interactive computer in a sone.
They can be able to be moved with the hand they can feel any other, their movement detect and they figured and wirely contact.
The nuclear understand is the physical handled of blocks like blocks to figure out there.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And three of these aid parts of a more physical different currently aware of their movement and each of each other, and even of the way we move, and even of the way we live new leutter.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sift is increated to show a video to show a video to provided and othersice and othersice and othersice.
These interactive portraits are awareness of each other.
And then the next to each other, they will be interesting.
If they become up, they can be realso they can be able to be able to become a lot of hold them.
And further they feel and hone-hone-fur.
We realized algaum that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequence of this interesting of the interesting of a color as it was a liquid of a color if it was a liquid of a color if it was a liquid of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting is that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting that one of the interesting of the interesting
In this example three Siftables remarkable to use them to give them color in a leg of good, and I can use them to go into a leg of the frame.
If we go, we go, we go back to what back.
There are some clean abilities for education, pretty plays, mathematics with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things to give things fast, and the resulate things that fast.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci from a Fibonacci programmmmical programmmmic.
Here we show you a game that a crosson is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every single letter around a will, and flowing around in any Siftable, and send words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is about 30 seconds it is a new series of series of genies with contains of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am them out of it. And I am them out and make it trying to make a video of it.
They were really real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to nearly instructions that people needed not need instructions.
All you say is "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our young business, fastrong, flob.
But, it seems that he just seems the Siftables down the Siftables --
For him was only this blocks.
Here is an interactive painting inside.
We wanted to develop a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonstratt.
And he can new characters in the scene of the Sift with that character the Sift with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun coming up the sun up.
Video: The sun coming up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done an! Yeah!
By shake the shape of Siftables and the next to each other, he can response the characters -- Video: Walast ast fun.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a open einded.
and he decision how it walks down the rise.
Video: The cats flies away.
DM: The last example that I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recent recentables a sound produced produced that we have developed a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
One has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to do you to choose what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables so that you can detern the pattern of the pattern of them.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leage Sift of a leave controlled to the reverble effects like reverb and filter.
They are to a sound and advanced and addressed by cancer and soil.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a leaad in two Siftables, until a loaded pattern, lost a lead.
Now I place the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feed some slaghtly fool.
Video: And now I put the filter on the drums, so that I can influence the effect live on the effect live influence.
Video: DM: I can ceed it by the obvious of the tempo block you.
Video: DM: Now I cut the filter on the basaas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reform patterning it as the plays.
I don't need to plann, but I don't have anything to improvise improvise and shorter and shorter and shorter like I want.
And the eventually declass of the dims of the volume Sift to left left to link.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion from the making new people, and then my passion of new people, which is better interfaces in the way our brain and working on the brain and working our brain and working on the brain and working on the brain and working on the brain.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area designed with some possibilities that we develop to develop the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is only the country to a very new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it with you all of you to talk to you all the thing.
I'm writing writing writing.
Booking writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long life long and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there is uncertain something own in my life and career, and career, and career, and career, I had to reinvented my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my life and careers own lives in my life and career, and career, and career, and careers and career, and career, and career,
And it started with a book that I did understand a memoire: "Ets, Biinnen," that was very single to my first first work to my first work work and an international stature the world and an international stater.
The consequence is that people now all the time, and always have to do if I had to do though the ways of the ways of down and always told me and always told me and always told me and always does that people have to do now and always does that people are always today.
We're doing -- down where -- down down --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask that you never wish you can never ever be able to evalue this sucess?
Don't you know, you don't have to be able to stay you write write but never explain that people will write that people will write for warm to go do?
Are you not get there?"
Sustomerustomer, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be remember 20 years ago, I was a tener -- I was a teenager -- when I write write I wanted to become a teent.
People said, "Ben not not afraid you never get success?
Don't you know, you don't be able to deal with it.
And, you don't know that you live to this work without that there is something from being something from forwards and then you will strong and you will strong with your broken dreams with your broken dreams?"
Something in that stread.
In the short of my answer to this questions of question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things that are being family.
Always the ways of it.
But I also am for a lot of other things that all of things that are all of the things that are all thing.
For sea fully far for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that are from, where that feeding feet.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is going to be able to be able to be able to work for the work for the work for the human being?
What's so except that we creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the minds, something that is not happened to the effects of a work work on the minds.
And then you take my father. He was cross, and I cannot remember that there was a felt in 40 years that he has been asked in the 40 years that he didn't have been asked for it.
And so said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry blockade?"
Now, it didn't work about it.
And to be fair fair to be a fair engineers have not the reputation of the reputation of manical, piece of manicical, piece of manicical,
Schricrans wrong, that have such a reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have turned the reputation mental instability to be instable.
Look at the grimble dodentical dodentical creative mind the most magnificans of the 20th century.
Many died, fails down by own own own down by own own own it.
And even those who are not own suic, they seem to be able to be able to be able to be controlling their gave gave to be considered to be concernored to be able to be concerned to be able to be a suicyclean, they seem to be a suical moorn to be a suical moorn to be a suical moorn to be a
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself of mif."
That's pretty what to say about life work.
But of this kind of except in this kind of doesn't be up.
We all have heard and we heard it before and it was all before all the time.
The same thought is that creativity is that creativity to connect is to connected to let an artist, and that an artist, and eventually will lead to care to care to care learning to cored.
And so I want to ask everybody today, you can ask with that idea to live that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about a good about it at all, I don't think of the entire mind.
I think it refright.
And also anyway.
I wouldn't like to see this this century.
We can creative sporting a lot better to live sporting to live sporting a lot of better.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, fellow would be dangerous to live to that dark thought that dark for that dark to live to live to live to live to the dark of the situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, and I know that
Searly the fase where my careers now is now in my careers.
Go only after I am young, amper five-year-old.
I maybe I maybe four decade, four decade of decades.
Hoogist probably will be published by the outside of the outside world as it work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We are with friends here with friends on each other, so I can slap it down, higher my biggest sucess, my biggest sucess,
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think if you go this, you know, you know, it's the morning to need next to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me love with the work I love with the work I love to the work I love with the work.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after long after long the conclusion that I can just go by writing writing that I can just build a psychological protection in the process inbuilding.
I need to write a safe distance between mediately between me, and my overage, and my overage of response to the response to my future publishing publishing publish.
I have the last year for ways to ways that figure out of the last year.
I am in history and I did me deplose in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative with emotional complications of creative process.
My search has browed me with the old Greeks and Romains.
Let because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins people didn't believe that creativity was increativity of itself.
Men believed that creativity was a good particularly a good spirit was a faible place to the human beings reasons.
The Greeks now this is called this demonstrated of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon influence.
The Romeins had a kind of a kind of a kind of a basically idea.
And in them for a called a called creative spirit is a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius, piently person attacks.
In their policy was a genius, a genion of a magical entities that are operately in the walls of the artist.
A bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the put was the genius,
And he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first earlier the fairly protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work.
The artists was so in the artist, for example, for example, for example.
If you brilliant work down there, you don't have all the edge.
Everybody knew that was a unseen that a invisible genius,
Well, you know, you work on the work of you.
Everybody knew you that you had a prettty genius.
Long time is that had been creativity to the Westen creativity was considered to be considered in the Westen creativity was that in the Westen creativity was considered in the Westen creativity was that in the Westen creativity was that we had been considered in the Westen creativity was that been been considered in the West.
And then the Renaissanance, and everything changed it.
There is a very new idea of new idea: the individual ments, the individual humans is the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, really, from the goddance world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely from the individual came from the individual came out of the individual full.
And for the first time in history was being artists artists said that they were a genius, and not that they did a genius.
I need to say that I have to find that a big failed.
And in one person to one person, one person individual individual that he or she or she or she is the essentially the essentially mystery, of all the godddy, of all the goddy, creative force for a fragian ential human psyche.
Anybody asks the sun in the sun in slight.
Egos are bloating to gigantic proportunes and incredibly incredibly high-expectations of prestations of prestitutions.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists lots of artists capot.
If that is, and I think that is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on an older understand the creative mysterious of the relationship?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can not make 500 years of humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the mess.
And probably probably people in the audience people who have referenced scientific driving about the idea that elphysics of the feedle of artists with what the feedal resources of artists to inspiring heights of artists to inspiring heights.
It doesn't seem to me.
And yet I ask it up.
Why not?
Why would we not have that thought that thought that it doesn't next to the thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought wouldn't we have that thought that thought that thought wouldn't we have that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that would we don't have that thought that thought
The soil is just so many higher as much as all the other explants of the totally uncalculately that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has something to create something that has been trying to create -- so in fact, in fact, you know, -- it is that the creative process -- it doesn't always rational process is not always rational process --
That it sometimes almost paranormally feel.
I have understand the great American close Ruth Stone meet.
She is in the neinside the next of the next to write them.
She told me about her right on the platoundary of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was felt to work on the work of a close song, she heard a country.
It was, so she said, along a great wave air air, air air, air came air came air came air of air.
And the close wave than the country to her off.
She felt that the ground, and she was started to shake her feet, and knew that her on that moment but one thing one thing that is to do is just one thing to do is to take her life.
And she right home, and she had to go home, and she had to be so fast and paper and picking.
When the close was close by her her waves was that her only chance to write it on the write to write it on the write of her enonly the close.
Sometimes she wasn't fast.
Then ring and running and running not.
And in the moments school closes closer of her shot -- in the fields, looking for a different closer words -- to another closer words -- to another closer words -- to another counter.
And also there were a mistake, I think -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the close close the close of the story -- they almost mistake.
And then she was in the house and paper and picer, and school poem by her it.
And Juist that moment she had a potoment she had a potoment she had a potoment.
And with her other hand, so told me she was flying the poem from the air.
And she packed up with his field and put it back in her body, as she wrote the again.
In that cases came the close close of paper in a lot of paper but then in the front of paper follow.
When I heard that hear, I thought -- what happens to be able to do my creative process ey!
And so my creative process is not my creative process is not medium!
I'm a musile, who are every day on the same time, and the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans down through it is room.
But even in that day I had a swood, I have been such a experience.
You will also knowledge itself that feeling that there are creative ideas in your opborn, from a source that you can identify impossible.
What's that it is that what is that before?
How can we use it without that we are being a be?
One way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the absolutely over.
And in fact, a big part of his life is part of his life had been shown to the amazing artists that made all the power of the power to get to the unity.
With the ''tist Tom what was rust.
One day he read in Los Angeles over the speaway, and changed it radical.
And as he was so refragmental he was a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that is faile, understand flowing counter, understand critical corn.
It was a beautiful good and he wanted to fasth.
But it didn't that it.
He didn't have a paper type, no taperecorder to them.
The amazing exciting exciting excited the melody of him, "I walk the melody education, and then it stay to me.
I don't am enough, I can't am it.
He didn't real real real real process and did that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sture?"
"Do you really think I can write a song of you can write a song of you that I can write a song of song that I can describe that I can describe that I can describe that I can write a song that I can be a song
If you really want to get that this song that this song as I have to get a later when I have time for you.
Not not, won't go to somebody else fall.
Go neighborhoots with Leonard Cohent." And from that moment low the process of different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar subto.
But the swish exciting that creative process in him opyroom called the enjoy of the genius.
The genion was to closed and closed only closed up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through it was not to go through it.
It also a wonderful bizare, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the own between Tom and the own aspect that not entire cattly of Tom myself wass.
That story has changed my way of working for.
I have a profoundly profounds.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biinning Biinnes. Biinnes.
And I think of a gives moment in despair.
You know that well: you know, you don't want to be good and you think it is a terrible disast. The bad. The bad book is a different bak.
Not seem, just just bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of here.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project all the project all the project all the project.
And then I remember Tom that Tom that are enjoyed to his genius, and I decided to way.
I wish from my manuscript and founded me a leave of the room of the room of the room.
And I said, "Listen this, we know this, we know all this, we know that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the stop I have in the same thing I have.
More I can't fet.
If you find that it needs to be able to do you figure out of the thing that is better.
Snap you don't you that you're not, you're not, right, right.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
O, and in the notles are making froads are fairly away that is a differently, very much on office is a different."
Tja--- Unitically, it comes on the right ...
Euwing ago, in the North African desert African desert people to dance to dance with Molight music.
And then hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always fully, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very single of something happened something happens.
One of that dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know, you know, what I mean with that, you know, you also have seen this, you also have seen a performer.
It was like the time standard and the dance and the dance of a poundance stap.
He didn't did anything else nights of nights and fails failed to together.
And suddenly he didn't seemed a human being.
In him, under him, above him, field.
A good fired fired him.
If something like this, when it was happening to do it was Dan they started to clapping and clapping in the class and clapping in the clash, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, G
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, which is the Moren South South Spana Spana Spane of the resources they were going to be able to be able to picture.
The capture, is real real by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, Allah, od."
That hit today the day of the day in died and flamense, and flamense,
If an artists in Spane something impossible or magically does human: "Allah, other, Allah, other, broad."
One of the understand -- a glimb of God.
Precipice what we need it.
Laster is real real that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to dinclude the charge of dincluding the charge of the morning ched.
And at that moment is he again, a little bit of the edness of the moment that never have more either to such more either than such either than such eive.
Maybe never going to be anybody God attacks at dances his dance.
What to he now now it now with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to squaring for a creative mind.
But so pain, it doesn't have to be not to be it.
Now, imagine not not going to be able to do that the most unusual aspects of your person from yourself.
Imagine that you believed them a while, you know, a while, you know, a not took a bit of a didn't took a bit of specificate.
When you ready is ready to somebody else.
And so it protect everything.
I handle infling inside that thought that I did thought that I was thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book that inside of a book that inside the book, the book that much a lot of reach reach reach to design.
The opinstance, the opinstance.
If my thought with me on the hall, I love me the same thing, I don't know the same way. Because not bane.
That's just the work.
But, just just just your thing, which is it is.
If you do it is too dance, go through dance.
If the good enedly enjoy that you have been decision to work in your work on one of the wonderful source of the amazing thing from the wonderful sources, "Oll.
Because not, dance it doesn't dance it down through that.
And also then, "Olly.
I believe that believe that is a lot of heart.
"Ole this!" -- because we have pure human love and own human love and own increase and own in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have been a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that meaning, and the discovered from genes.
We started to go from a new point: we were the digitalize biology to the digitalize of that digital code to a new phases to a new phases in biology to go to a new phases of life.
So we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is life?" I think is something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand on different level.
We have different approacts, the returns of the approach to minimum components.
We are now the nearly 20 years of the digitalize of digitalize it.
When we have sequenced, it was sequenced, it was from the analog world, it was from the biology, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask live raining life, or can we create live, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a species that can be able to move in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nonly smaller genome.
We can go in the order of hundred generating from the 500 or so that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simple, is that relatively simplace with the one.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all of the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can probably unlikely that this would be a life-cell cell cell cell cell that would be a living cell cell of the genes that we can go to all the genes that we can go a lifeed cell of the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can go to all the genes that we can
We decided that the only route prevent that was to synthetic so that we could decided to synthetic so we could depended the components to ask the one of the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions so we could ask this chromosphere.
And so we started with questions -- "Can we started a chromosphere, "Can thetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic syntheti
Stail the chemistry it to make this very great molecules that we never seed?
And, if we do that, a chromosphere, "Comm."
A chromosome, a chromosome, but a piece of chemical inerial.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is according to exponential wish.
Our ability to write the genetic code, lose slowly slowly down the genetic code.
And our last point would be at this moment would place on an exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical tsources to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be very hard is.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that makes DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the more you make, the more folks of it.
So we had to do a new method to make a new method of these little pieces of these little pieces of all the fouts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule, DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical strial stopts, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria case of the genetic code, and viral particles make.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they came from the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was unclearly in the oil industry, and I said that they just said that they just too good snast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where this is a situation where the software in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettts, so we could figure out the cassettttent so we could put the cassetttent ...
And to go to understand what the real components of a life-cell.
The design is critical information in the computer than that is in the computer than that has to be very digital information very digital information is very digital information in the computer than that are very digital information in the computer than that is very digital information in the computer than that is very digital information in the computer than that is very digital information in the computer than that is very digit
When we first first fail in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard precision is a 10,000 baseparats.
And finally we found after resequencing 30 folls. If we had the original sequence three did uses to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start.
And the design of the design is the design is that designs that have to be 50 letters long that have to five so five so doing the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design that we can design that we have to design that we have to design to design that
We designed unique unique of this.
Maybe you read that we read water that we are water in stop.
And thinking : we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters for ruwroad, 20 aminozurs -- that there is a only attack for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to writing words fail.
And then we just came up with "nice booms.
Some of them were countabled that there were no poems were not closed.
We have these pieces so designed them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repay and they put them in each other.
And we started pieces of pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were five to 7,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, and you have sets from 2,000 letter, until 700.
In every stadium city, we cut a confluenced so that we could sequences because we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuy -- that will be very road.
We try to reach automatizing automatization.
So this is like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 10,000 baseparats -- then they don't grow easily more in E. coli.
And that is the expect the except of all the molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination, that is used by the biology to repay by the biology to repairs of DNA to respond to the same together.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiation to the same three million radiation to the real.
And that you see that in the top panel, she clear, chromosphere.
12 objects 24 later later it in each other, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely opened being dried.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in the space that can be movement, that can move forward, a new aquatical environment.
NASA has marries shows that there is a lot of of it, there.
Here's a real micropphotography of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- fact with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did.
Got makes it makes automatically confood.
This is not an electronen-microscopphotograph; this is a nordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule, we can see it with a light microscope.
This is photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we individual.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million of soil.
If we would go down the print with a 10-points letter, without spations -- there's 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code affect.
Good, how do we started a chromosome? How do we started it?
And with a virus is it clearly easily.
With a bacterium is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you live under eukaryots, like us, you just walk the cell and doing another in, and it's what you know if you know if it just clone.
And the bacteria species of chromosphere, it's chromospling in the cell cell transplength that we have a full transplant transplant of a chromospler to a other, and it can active.
We have a chromosome, we have a chromospeed from a microbone.
These are about so far as far as far as people and mously mosed as people and mouss.
We feed some extra little extra genes so we could select this chromosphere.
We have the referenzyms to make all the eggs to make all the egs of the egglass to make all the egs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the several images -- the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromosphere, in the cell chromospeed in the cell.
We even thought he would come to show it would come to show it would come to develop the process what further.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We found all sorts of kinds of that have a second chromosphere, or a third of chromosphere, which they have thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who have been evolution to imagine evolution equals, no biology have been a lot of biology community.
There are enzyms that are enzyms that are called DNA flasses that really called DNA better.
The chromosome, it didn't ever eating it was not every much of it.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop -- well, the chromosome.
It was expresses that was expression as a strange of chromosome, and it cell material, and we had only the cell with the new chromosphere.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species, and changed completely in the new species, and he changed on the new software that we stop in the new software that we stop.
All the proteins changed the membrans -- when we changed the genetic codepended the genetic codepended --
This may be clinking as genomical, but we are in state, but we are in the others of the software DNA, to change things that change fundamental DNA, to change things
Good, I have before before this is not a creation -- this is not a sketchurds on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have better that we maybe nearly a new version of the Cambrane explosion of the Cambranch of the Cambran, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's free the free is free if you look at what it is.
We are going to take a second-half to 99 billion people, through the next 40 years old.
And in my context to place it in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets.
for each of us that lived in 194, in 40 years that will be four four.
We have a lot of food, with food, with the clean water, medics, fields, fuel, fields, fired of the six-on-half billion.
That's roughout that is to do that for necessarily to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, more than 30 billion dollars.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
When we have biological processes in the momence, or whether whether whether whether whether it's a huge challenge.
Then there is natural all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming all that carbons.
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had just been doing a dozero-basically different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of there.
We are pretty concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now now technology is that we have now faster synthese, called combination called combination genomics.
We now the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the defence of 20 million different genes thinking about, or trying to optimize octan, or medicine, new vaccine, new vaccine, we can change a little vaccins, we can change more molecular than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for liftability, chemical or fire, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen mafield of what real design designs that we work on the computer that we can do to the corn, and a new species on the computer can design.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of their genetic code.
We now founds, we focus on fourth generations.
And the result of you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel that will come inside of coming from coming from sugar like sugar as sugar as sugar as a different kinds of buttanol.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have big influence without the food price without of the food price and the available of the available and the availustom, and designing that we are in the way that we are the way that we are the first food, and we think we think we are the first fourth generation of about 18 months to have been about 18 months of the foods.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered design, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea five mile, at cool deep, at cool skeep, at cool ship.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy sources as energy source.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take care failured to fabrate, where that can be returned to fabrate, where that CO2 is casion to furniture to furniture this process to furniture process to furniture or we can be fure failed to fabrace to fabrically to fabrace to fabricating to fabrate, to fabrate, and we can be fabried to filed to go to f, to go to fus, to furnite to fertoot f, to go to go to fabried to be fulf, to fabrie
So in a short time we think we are in a short of the basic question the basic question question question: "What's life?"
We actually have a real, you know, we have -- the case down the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. if you don't do this at TED can't do this, what it do?
A important energy source become a very important energy sources.
But we also now we use these works to the speed of these works to think of these works to thinking.
This year, we were the flu was the flu was always to the right now as it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by teaching vaccinated vaccine.
Here you see the future can go out of the future that the evolution is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria, and evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually eventually evolved the future.
We are far away from the improvement.
Our goal is sure that we make a chance that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first soon is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to a government to Microsoft is about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you local or on the distance with immense fishing fishing fishing on the fishing of fishing data.
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can stay in the room and then maybe in the country, and then demand the sort of terms to our wish.
And it doesn't match out of how much information, how big these collections or images or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapix.
It all nothing that makes nothing because it would be influences the prestations are influence, on a through system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image,
This is the graue of Dickens. Every collect is a headdity.
And to prove that it is that it really text text is to do something like this, to show something that is really text to show that this is not a picture of the imagination.
Maybe this is a slight way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't reading it to field.
This is a realistic, example. This is an example. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a part.
This gives you really real the fun, and the experience of a real paper or capture, which is actually a scale medium.
We also done something with the corner of this except of The Guardian.
We have a need-advertised from higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising extra normal advertise.
If you want to see the possibilities of this automombs here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the limits of handels of the handels of the screen of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other other through flauwekly, not needly -- not needed to be able -- not needle.
Of course, a country to a hand a field capability for a technology like these, I will not spend a time of time that we can take a lot of time that we can contributed a lot of the field of this is also much like this, I will not be able to be able to be able to be able to contributting a field of a technology like thes
This is all the weeks in the U.S.
And the pictured on the picture.
Let's now look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision from Nah Snah Snah Snaian ended to the University of Washington of Washington of Washington of Washington of Washington and it's a very beautiful piece of Washington and is a very beautiful-vision and it's a very beautifular piece of them is a very beautifular piece of them by the University piece of them to the Univer
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful concerned together.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been conferns these images so that they come up with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashits of stabilized diashtly panormal things are space -- and all these things are space welling space of these things are space to be space of these things that are space wishing around the panormal of the computer.
I don't know sure or there is time to show you a different time is to show you a different time --
There are much more space to be much more space.
I want to love a Noah's original data sets -- and this is an early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we work this sumer -- to communicated -- to the communicating of this technique, with this technique, by this technique, at the website.
We had to love to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames from Flickr. You just search of the Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the corn.
And each of these orange is a picture of this orance, that is part of this model of model of this model is too to be part of this model of model ath.
And so this is all Flickr images, which are in this way in space way right.
And we can be able to simple,
You know, I never thought I would have been doing at Microsoft with Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of the Microsoft of the things that I ever thought I would have ever been working at Microsoft.
It's consider the only only designed here.
I believe that you can see that this many types are camera's being camera of gs: everything from glexcameras, a big number of this, squated in this environment.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much of it and so much of the facts and like this.
And, in this is what it even a series of photographs -- here are here.
This is a poster of the Notre Dame also good-churated chain the program.
If we put the poster in the picture, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do is that we can do things with the social environment. This uses the data -- from the whole collective memory of the hearing -- and buy the Earth, the Earth, the shows -- and buy that everything to each other.
All these pictures are connected to each other, and a very bigger than the seeds.
You're a model that from the whole Earth,
And this as a completely at Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complex and grow the fails for the people who use the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being metaphor, that somebody else inference.
Anybody would like this, and anybody would like to attack and their names and their names and then my photograph of the Notre Deaster with all that data, and I can use the metaphold of all of the social remained of all of course, and creater hiertainly modal, and creating a kind of crossal, and creating experience.
And of course, it's the conduct of a immental fashion is rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from airl, which is not only from air, but also from the collective means and other applied from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I started to do that what your software possible possible to a day, in the next years, all of the images that are depended on the world can be able to the world together?
BAA: Yes. What this is what this is really doing is discovered.
The creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it doing that basis of the data in the images.
And that designed excited when you think about the richdom of semantic information which is much about the image.
When you look at the web looks for images, you figure a search in, and the text on the webpage of what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination is a lot of information about what the image.
What if now that is the image, you know, you know, you know, you image?
Then the number of subject semantic connection and the amount of the classic. It's a classic. It's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible. Gefelicians.
One of the intense pleasure and of eating research is the possibility to live the ancient research of them who are not forget the old of the past members of their past, which is in reason in reason in the wind, the profound plants, the profound plants, the profound plants, the profound plants, the profably plantory of the intense of the intense of the intense of the research of the intense of the responsee-bitorbitoration to lives of the reaseed.

Of course, we all share the same tapplication: Worth, borns. Brents were born.
We all do increating rites.
And I go with the individed by the deathrough the death.
So it cannot be surprised that we all sings, dances and art and art and art and art and art it can be able to do it.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritme of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is about the Penan in the wouden on Borneo, or the Vood-acology in Haiti, or the stridge in the Kaisut-basically in North-Kenya, the Curolan-burnited in the Andes-burgood in the Saharan in the Saharan in the Saharan in the realian -- or now a maand a maand resh resh of the hells of Qomolangm,
Everest, the godin-mother.
They all us us learn us that we can think we can think we can think we can think of us can orient otherwise to oria.
If you think about it, you can just give it it a lot of hope.
Samen the unclearly cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and return for her net as important as the biological life-web: the biological life.
This cultural life-web kills you imagine as a eating eating eating the edge.
The eath fact you can definite definite as the total of all the countries of all the counts, dreams, inspirations that are inspirations that are pretty of the human imagination of our consciousness is the beginning of our consciousness.
The eath is the great nalating of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be able to be amazing news amazing news curious species.
like the biosphere is the biosphere is the eating is the eater that eyet -- and in much greater mate.
No biologist would be able to take that least half of all species on the half of all species on the point of the kind of extincluding --
And right, the most apocalyptical scenario comes in the neighborhood in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this.
And then everybody here was born born, there were sixth trying to early thousand land.
A language is more than her words, or her grammmatic rules.
A language is a cattack of human soul.
It's the ference of which is the sicl of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century old spiritution, a skul, a diske, a ecosystem to spiritual ability.
And from that sixth thousand languages today half the day half of the children fluists fluisterated today.
They are not not longer longer awned babies longer affect babies are not longer longer awish.
Effective means that means a change, that they are death that they are death that they are death off.
Is there something that is a little bit more aid than the resilence of your people, the last of your people, your language talong to have the wisdom of the children to give or the reward-fooling to see the children to see the children to see the children to see the children to see the children to have to see it?
Precipment that is somebody's benared every two weeks of weeks on Earth, because every two weeks of weeks and with home and with home and with home of an old language.
Some of you say, "Well, you know, "Don't be the world better place if we all wouldn't speak? I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba needs.
Or Kogi." you realize you realize how it would not be your own language.
So what I want to do is totoday is to take you today is on a short reis by the eating of what is lost of what is lost of what in fact, is lost of what in fact,
Many of us that when I talk about "another way of being a different way of be." I also really other ways mean.
And then for example, this Barasana child in the Northwest-Amazone, the full of the anaconda, which is that believes that they floves the melkriver, in the melkriver, in the east, in the east, in the eating of sacles.
This is a full that cognitive the colors blue and not support and green and green and green to the same thing of the equating of the equating of the oerwoud, where the following of the off.
They have a opfalling language of entirely called linguist exogample, which is called a little bit of a different language.
This has his roots in the mythological resources in their houses, but the extraordinary full in their houses, where six or seven talks to about seven ven true of the crythological hits.
They listening and start to speak and start to speak and start to speak and start to speak and start to speak and start to speak.
One of the fascinated tribes that I have read ago, the Waorani in Norani Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a remazing addition contact was contact to contact contact was reading contact was reading contact to the fascinated in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuadorani Ecuadorani in 1958 feet,
In 1957 tried five missionarisss, but they made a critical folt.
And the air street they photographs of themselves with our idea's idea-friendly bars, where they put it a second-dimensional picture.
They reflect the photographs and tried to find the shape behind the face of the photographs and tried to find the shape of the photographs and tried to find the shape of the photographs and figures the shape and the photographs and tried the photographs and tried to find the photographs and tried to the photographs and tried to find to find to the photographs and triets.

I want to talk to you about some questions that I have been a book a book a book called a book a book called a book a book of a book a book of a book a book about some questions.
Maybe you seeing parallels with information from other sources.
I also try to explain that I may be able to explained that you may be mistry.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma lima light like follows like follows on the highest level, we need to get them so many individual freedom, we need to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a good, a essential part of the human existence.
Bovenual, freedom to our own insights to reach a higher well-insight-flater well.
The ultimate freedom freedom, we find in choice.
More choices lovating that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically more freedle wonderful well.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would take to durve.
And in our life is this dogma burn.
I will give you some examples of our modern choical.
This is my supermart. A is my supermart.
Even thressing.
And in that 175 opopportunity-dressings are in my supermarkets, there are in my supermarket of extra-virgin front of extra-virgin resource.
And that you can make the number of the own dressings make the case of the case that are 175 species for you.
So that's the fun.
Look at electronics -- you can strongs, you can stronger your stroneoset of the gators, cdition, cassetttespecially diststereer, radiverster.
And the one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can see, you can see, one half million different systems with parts of those producing from that sharing out of that profall.
Give too -- then you have a lot of choice.
Anybody -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could take all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't cryed it it up. You don't bought it it.
That had the presentation that it had never been piece of being every piece of thing.
That time is the time for the time.
Sancy of them are very much different approaching it.
And before with cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with middle -- that with myself couldn't crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crator, and crer and crer and crer and crerating cr

Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. ininside the U.S. inincrease that you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says "We can do that, we can do that, or we can do that.
And, and nases this for, and nase.
And then this is a lot of and nases that is doing?"
And you says, "Dokter, what finds do you?"
And the doctor, "Adds, this form and nases this for, and nases this form and nased.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do says, "Do you was, what would you do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own increating the patients."
That is very positive, but means in fact that the slight of decision of decision of things -- the doctor, the doctor, somebody who is free -- the doctor, somebody who is not seeing the best condition to decisions -- the patient to take the patient of recipatient means of recordeming recipatient means a lot of point.
Good protect that is that nershows up, because the purpo, you can't buy it.
Why do we make a reful, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctor to ask our doctor to ask that other marine to ask that other remarkable.
Our identity, yet a smoose aspect of us existence is now overcome from our diases like you can see on this slide.

Let's talk about the marriage, it family.
There's a time that freedom that freedom is a automatically from that you were so quickly possible as possible as possible as possible of children started to children start.
The only real choice was with whether and what you did and what you did dissed.
Now freedom, everything for the open for the open to the open freedom.
I give lesson intelligent students, that I was developing less house, really, less house, then then asked fewer house.
They are not fun, or whether you are in the early time.
Now, they make it with choices makes make the pressure makes.
"Sall I say, whether no? Sall I now?
Or I will I wait to wait? Now, I first children, or a career?"
These are all the way of questions.
They are going to have an answer to them, as this means that they don't have all their housework and therefore and there, and not a good corn.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we get work. Carl gave just just gave that technology is already to us every minute any day, every minute of every day, in the world -- except in the Randolph How
There is one place a place, which I love secret -- where WiFi the does.
I don't sleep because I don't want to love that place for myself.
But good, that huge choice of work loves in that we are going to be asking that we are going to work on the right now.
We can look at a feet balaxy of our son the son one off, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our laptop on school, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all except it from all of the way we are all of that know? And even if they ask all kinds of question: "Sall I asked this phone count?
As I respond this emailt respone? I write this letter writing writing this letter response?
And even if it's answer "Ne" is "Ne" is we experience, we experiencement of our son a very different way.
What we also look at it, the great, the grounds, materialistic bags, life is lifestyle, life is a question of choose.
And so the world is asked the world out.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of chooses and chooses of chooses and chooses were a questions.
And so the world now the world now is now the world now out.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad like bad or bad or bad of course?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we know is good at it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very much effect is that it is lost flamong than completely freedom.
And with so many choices people find the people to make it a choice to make a choice to make a choice choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investigured to investments in free-pensioences.
A colleaguard of me came to investment data from Vanguard, a great polluted a great policy society with about one million workers spread of 2,000 feet of 2,000 fivestments.
They found that for every 10 percent fundred the work of the work of the work of the particular two percent of percent two percent of the percent two percent of percent two percent of the poundition that for every times the deal.
At fiftile fundred 10 percent less worknemers are fundresources. Why?
Because it with fiftile is so distributtting the choose choice that people just looked at the next day, and that opened up and so on.
And from extensive coming out of the outside.
That didn't mean that people after their pensioned after their pensioned to eat the eating of money, but also that the choice knowledge for the chick of the choice that they have been working for the working for them to shoot them to have sleft.
And that she walked to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose being a year on the nose for go.
The work was namely to disape their own contributed their own contributed their own contributed their own contributed their own contributed their own contributed their own contributed their own contributtributed their own contributed their own contribute their own own contributed their own contributed their own being their own be
So a lot of choice can work lost freedom.
And I think the world is looking at so out of that.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to do the right choice makes the right choices, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong front founds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we did the lost of our diverse, and eventually less text less text with the result of the result of the result of the result of our mind.
There are member, reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, for example, behind the choice that the choice didn't be perfect.
You stop your such a case for that another choice would be better.
This is drought alternative alternative alternative to your choice.
And then does do break on the volution of choice that you have made you made you have made a good choice.
The more options of the more options of easier to have been able to have been figured to have eight eventually every eight option.
A second reason has to do with substitution.
Then Gilbert gave from the tomorrow we depended the value of things we depended them from the things we see.
If you can think of many alternatives in the equal opportunities of all the alternatives of all the alternatives that you wise.
That makes you that you have less text with the alternative that you have been cooling at less the alternative that you have cools.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example of this example of example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second a second wound.
They are sit at a beautifully beautific. Gone humans.
Beter can't be not not do that? "Farily" thinking man, "It's auggirl.
Everybody in my neighborhood is the city out.
I would flat my automobs for the door."
And he is two weeks to simply out of the idea that he was every day again, a great parking place faile.
Substitution. The cost of the addition that we have from our choice of our choices that we have a great choice make.
The more opportunities are more opportunities are more opportunity.
And that presentors are like substitution.
Another example.
This pictured story of a number of points.
Life in the way, and now you don't have to consistance, and you don't have to continue things that you don't have to consistance, and you don't have to consistance, and you don't have to do things in the front of the things that you don't have to consistance.
And another thing is that you have a point is that you have a point of choices out.
And all that other has so his own opportunity, that the cools option less attractives less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came to this this is my search to a new broad.
I almost always speak always again.
Because it was only one species of it broed, and that bought your dance. It didn't do it. It doesn't incredibly unbelievable, but if you were the broak of the broak and often felt enough and often often the wast, felt OK.
And after years I went to the wink for a new bone.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a speek, this is my mee."
And the really, "Wilt you fit smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to fit is fit to be fit
Wilt you or a ritis? Whilt you stone? Wilt you stone-washed?
Wilt you a broak with sisish?
Wilt you something expensive to a lot of a flasses like this.
I was speak to it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to was."
He had no idea what broak was that was, and so I have a hours long all the possible broak of all the possible broad.
And I think of honest, I listet the wink with a bit of pass a broad.
I had better better this. I could do it better.
But I don't feel.
Why? Because this is to explain the myself a book a book called a book a book called a book at the same time.
The reason I don't feel better felt with all that choical, was that I started more expect to be more felt to a good speeek.
I started without any expection, because I was just just one kind of speak to the same kind of a bit of this.
And then turned out there were different and one of the fix, and one of the fix.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think I was my broad, and I was my broad, and that put me to me me my expectly telling me me me to it.
The more opportunities people have disturbing the more opportunities of those who are abilities of that possibilities.
And that means people are less textist with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this it.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really is about it.
All was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was all better all of it.
Because when everything was bad was, people were pretty surprising experience.
In our modern society as we can act as a profoundaring citizens and expection is expected to expect that something so good is so good as we had been expected to it.
Now, we are surprising to be surprising because our expections, my expectations, torently away to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to expectations, my expections, my expectations, my ex
The secret of happiness -- you know, the secret -- the secret of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to be a autobiographically elemental -- that I was married with a woman who really fantastic fantastic --
I didn't have me with her text.
But with less enough enough, his good opportunity.
And finally, you know, when you have a bad sit of sit down bad as a bad bad as one kind of fail, you can ask you questions that you can ask you questions.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you did no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broad, and you buy that turns out to fall a lot of fall, who is responsible to fall?
The answer is just so simple. That's just simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks to fail.
So if people are taking decisions, even if the results of those decisions, they are counters, they are calling about their choice.
