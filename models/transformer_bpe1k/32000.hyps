Last year I showed these two slide of the United that the pole cap, that the last three million years of the size of the U.S. with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent curve.
But this distributed the worst of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disection of the ice.
The ice capacity is in a certain sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crink and crine.
The next slide that I'm showing is a version of what happened is a version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanence is disduce in red.
As you see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the year, the yearal ice during the winter.
And it craces in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or old is almost like blood, which is almost like blood, which is almost like the five here.
In 25 years is the from this to this before.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen found the Norse Icelebrate and there's a very big amount of heat a very big amount of carbon diown, when it is designed in methane, when it gets dead in meth.
As a true amount of the total resources in the atmosphere, would double the amount of the atmosphere, if we describe the case point point to describe the case point to the atmosphere.
In some unedle ineep, in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another undeep me.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real real or we will be able to be real
A reason for that, is that this huge "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smiles aterriver.
The water than ever the water than ever ever bigger than ever ever big.
This is the Kangerlussua's sua's suaffold in South west Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because it's the landics of the sea of sea legal than the sea legal where it comes in the sea legal trip.
These streams are flightly flightly to flee.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the biggest ice mass on Earth.
At a month course, scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the ice of the South Pole very quickly to the meltory of the south islands.
The whole continent is showing for six meters of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice massa, there are now new now, there are new now, that was a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the world's population of that melt time.
In the Andes, this gler the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappear, it disappears the drinking water.
In California was there a function of 40 percent in the snow.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dred dreamatic dress.
And the number of nature in the world is straight with an incredible and never seeing through the world and never seen.
Four more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the present 75 years.
This pattern is completely intentiful.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we've been given years of CO2 to the last five years of CO2 hours ...
25 miles every day in our oceans, Keast, look at the east area of the Stille Ocean east-values, and every side of the India subcontinent, there's a drastic drastic drastical drifical drifical drify in the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, is designed to be far, which is burning for 20 percent money is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and it's all the largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban incredibly charges.
But we see a case case of it.

We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduced introduced the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an upon how that works.
So here's me. For those who didn't have any one that the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment ever encountly supply in reverse.
It has to be the conditions that were neable, less than a billion a billion times a billion times a billion times a second second million times a seconds.
Enorm ambitious, so, this!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is what I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in contach so you can see.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That was a party for a party correctly.
It's a picture of the first particle that all the way around that all the LHC should go around the LHC with a piece of the LHC with a piece of the LHC in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that photograph, we knew that photograph, we knew that the machine works, which is a huge overwinning.
I don't know if this is the largest biggest the biggest of this, or then, when somebody was going to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden windows.
And those behaviors 13 thousand ample of amples when the machine was full in full power to full the machine in ful.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small wear to.
They can do that because they can do superceive on all temperatures.
So in the wall, 271 degrees of the gars, the might between the stars, that can drags that flows power that free power that power between the stars,
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, magnets a constructive.
And that was a wirmer, and there was a little bit of the wirmer, and electrical weather against that 13 thousand ample of ample engineers.
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realizes if you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons and away they were going to move 30 inches in a small.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather intact.
We will put it again, and we expect measurements in Juniverse so we can go with the further so that we can go with the conference of the universe of the universe
Now, of course, that have incredib, that increase the debate of scientific research. It's easy research.
I think it's so difficult that it's so difficult that we go further than ever the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, and I did the define of the value experiments of his learning was Michael Farday, this is the last for the progress of human beings than the such of human spirit than the progress than to take the human mind of the human beings are not going to be completely that we are completely in the entist, and that is not completely being completely that we have been complearning our designing that we are designing our own vietated in the definitive, and that we nove, and that we are definitious are not to be compute before bebebebebebebebebebebeings of the ded of the mote bebeings arietablecissue our olearly
Thank you very much!
I would like to start to ask to ask to your child back to your childhood when you played with blocks.
When you discovered how to understand how to understand and aware and conscious problems and resolve with the defence with and defence with and hanter of space-relationships.
Rumely insight is strong because with the understand the world to understand them.
As an information inspired by the nurture of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advising advising with my advisior, Jeee of Kalanithi -- what if we were a computer to ask -- what if we were a computer to use a computer moved in a kind of digital finger as a kind of digital finger's moves that moves individual reauthoration that we could conceive with both information with both information
and can orders as we want to leave it?
This question that we have to see that we decided that we decided to respond an answer by the building of Siftables.
Sift is a Sift is a Sift a interactive computer size of a cookies.
They can be moved, they can be moved with the hand they can feel another movement and they can detect a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded by understanding blocks that they can be moved by understand
Boveners are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulate digital information.
And before these tools have a more physical physical discious movement and even of the way we have and even of the way we move them motion, and even of the way we live and fun new and fun interactions and nice.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sift is that Sift is to show a video is to played a video and others played and others played played and other.
These interactive portraits of conscious conscious conscious.
And then they are going to each other to each other, they will interests.
If they are reduced to do this, they can also far, and can be able to smix.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of the interesting consequences of the interesting of everyday gets and put it a fluence of a color was a fluid that was a fluid that was a fluid of a fluid that one of the interesting of everyday.
In this example three Siftables and I can use them to go and use them to go into a leg to to go into a leg and I can use them to be color in a leg in.
If we have gone to save what we are going to reach it back.
There are some clear cutilities for the education, massive plays, mathematics and logics and logics where we want to give people the possibility to see things quickly, and the result of seeing things qual.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci with a simple skill set programative solid.
Here we show you a game between a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every randomy in every single letter to any Siftable, and sense, and sense, in a dictionary words in a dictionary in a dictionary words.
After about 30 seconds it is about 30 seconds it is a new series of letters with break of the possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the Media Lab, and I'm in a video and there's a video and there's a video of it.
They were really gone away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need no instructions that people have need no instructions that people have nearly need to have instructions of this applied not need instructions of this application is that people need no instructions of this applied not nearly instructions of this applied not needed instructions of this applied
Everything you have to say "Make words, and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our young base tester, right-fire.
And it seems that he just set the Siftables to step the Siftables of the Siftables of the Siftables that he was just the Siftables that he was only shows he just the Siftables to be just the Siftables that he just just the Siftables to just the Siftables that he just just the Siftables to be just like the Si
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting an interactive painting in an interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for teach language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can new characters in the scene of the scene of the table, by the same the Siftile of the table.
Here he sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good did don! Yeah!
By shape of Siftables and the next to shape the characters of the characters with each other -- Video: Wealable.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decision how it walk.
Video: The cates flying air.
DM: the last example that I will show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recently developed that we developed a sound produces and drum.
One has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in emptables are being injected so that you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern through the pattern of a legal Siftile that are live control effects like reverb, as reverbasically and filter.
They're being a sound and added and purpose by cance.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I place the base line --
Video: ThM: Now I feel a little bit of sleep work.
Video: There I now the filter to the filter to the filter to the filter live influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate the office of the cancers of the offo blocks.
Video: ThMan: Now I buy the filter to the filter to the base for the base of expression.
Video: DM: I can re-rearn the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvise improvise and shorter as I want.
With the dims of the dims of the whole through the volume Sift to left left on the left of the whole Sift to the left soil.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion to make new people, and my passion of new people, which are stemed in the way our brains and lightly works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of possibilities that we design in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the pretty to a very new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
Thank you from heart.
I look at it to you all with you and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and you and
I'm writing.
Books write writes is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm already to write and I don't think that will ever change in the entire life.
And yet there is a very unless something in my life and career, and career, and career, and I had to re-re-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
It started with a book that I did a book that I wrote incentive, "Eten, Biddle -- Biddle -- that very opposed to my earlier world and a international existing the entire world and an international stator.
The second is that people now and always have to be dragged me and always that I came up with it.
World where -- dam!
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you to succare never fresh that you can never be success to me.
Don't you know, if you don't remaining your entire life writing but never remains a book publishing that people will be heating heating head.
Are you not afraid there?"
Erg was reason, you know, you know, you know.
Well, of course, that would be very much that I remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- when I told a teenage -- if I told I wanted to be write that I wanted to be write for 20 years ago.
People said, "Don't you get success that you never get success success of yourself?
Don't you know, if you don't know about it. At you will go on through it seem?
Are you not afraid that you live to this work on this work without that there ever something from fails and then you will dead in the public dreams with your broken diter bitters of fail?"
Something in that stretch.
And in the short comes to my answer questions to this questions that "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afafraid for all those things that becomes that are being called
Always that.
But I'm also for a lot of other things that you don't want to know that all of a lot of other things that all of it.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to be a last time that the last time that the last time that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically that somebody is to be afraid for the work for work for the work for work for the work for the work for the work of work that they have to be real for the work that somebody is totally to their op?
What is so particularly so particular processes that we make sure to make the effects of the effects of the mind goodnesses that we didn't happened to be able to work.
Take my father. He was skifically engineer, and I can't remember that there was ever asked in the 40 years that he was ever asked to him or he didn't have a bath.
And so said, "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, it didn't work about it.
And to be fair fair fair of being separated by the centuries of the centuries of manical depressive alcoholists for piece.
Schriters writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human beings are instability to be instability to be instability to be instability to be instability to be the reputation of the reputation is not just a writerators, also much more creative instability to be the reputation
Look at the griming dotors of the most magnificant creative spirits of the 20th century.
Many died, often fired by doing own to do it.
And even those of the ones that no suicide of fundress their gave implicative to sweeks.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "With one of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty what to say about your lifeswork.
But of this kind of speak we don't look at any more smell
We all heard it before and have heard and have it with sucepted all accepted it.
The sense of thought is that creativity creativity is that creativity to connected with suffering that is going to lead to core an artist,
So I want to ask everybody here today, can you with that idea of life?
Even you soon that OK?
Because I'm going to find a good about it now, I don't think it all the way the way doesn't have pretty pretty thought.
I think it is the reason I think of the reason
And also another domine.
I wouldn't see that this century this century.
We can creative sporting a lot of better to live better of life.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be to live to that dark thought life.
Sean, the fase where my career now in my career now is now in.
Go only after: I'm young, amper fatty again.
I can may be four decade a four decade of through decades.
Heypiece of the extraordinary is going to be seen as the world as it world as the world as the world as the world that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends here with friends here with friends on each other, so I can probably slight my biggest success for behind me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think about that, you're going to think about nine nine hold to the neine down to the nine hours to the board rise on the through the boine.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to hole e with the work I love with the work I love to work where I love to the work of the work I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work that I love to the work that I love with the work I love with the work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
After long after a long time I get to the conclusion that I can only go through a psychological protection in the process building inside the process building inside the process.
I have to go on a safe distance between a secures between myself and my considerstanding between myself and my failable to the reactions on my future publics.
I have seen the last year, I seen it for ways to do.
I have in the history and have flass in other societies and have found in other societies to see if others have found creative people to help create creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been birness to the old Greeks and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins didn't believe that creativity was not a hundance of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a good mind was a good mind of a very, unknowledge place to humans came to humans and unknowleds.
The Greeks called these basically refers of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demand that he had a demand influence that he had a demand influence of him who influence him that he had a demand that he had a demand that he had a demand that he had a demand that he had a demand that he had a demand that was a demand that was fluenced a demand that was fluence to the demand that was fluening him that he had flistening a demand that was fluence that he had a dem
The Roman had a kind of a kind of a similar idea.
As heat that point called a geniused a genius, a genius.
The funny is that the Roman is not a genius, with a genius,
In their production was a genius, a genius, a genius, a geniused in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist of the artist of the genius,
And he gave shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier earlier protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artist was so in protection to so much against for example,
If you were basically burn, you didn't have all the equal early every easy of the eds.
Everybody knew that a invisible that you had a invisible.
Well, you know, you work on the resource, that not only have to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inhang genius.
And the time is that been created in the Wests creativity was considered to be considered
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything.
There was a very new idea's idea of new idea: the individual humans is the tool point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attended from the goddle world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity, that creativity came from the individual individual
And for the first time in history was in the history of artists said that they were a genius, and not that they were a genius.
I have to say that I think I find a big faile.
And to one person, one person, one person, one person, one individual individual human beings or she field the equire, the source, the source, the source, creative and the familiar is to a fragile and the famility for a fragility for a fragile human psyche.
As if you ask somebody asks the sun in small.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportions and there are incredibly high expectations and express expectations of express expectations and expressions to be expressions and expresent to the gigantions and remainable to gigantic proportions to gigantic proportions and there are incredibly lowing up
And I think this pressure the last 500 years many artists has made a lot of artists of artists in the last 500 years of the last 500 years many artists capot.
If that is, and I think, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to understand back an older the relationship between the relationship between the creative mysterious mysterious mysterious understand back the creative mysterious understand back the creative mysterious understand back the entirelative mysterious understand back in the cre
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speaking.
Probably sit in the audience people who have resources that have resources have the idea that edle creatures have a few creatures with what earner pooder the work of artists to inspiring heights to inspire the work of artists and inspiring heights in the audience of artists in the audience of artiful,
It doesn't seem to be all of you have to get you all in there.
And I ask it to me.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought that thought to be follow?
It was so much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally crazy incomputability that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has a little bit of something has try to create something -- so in fact, in fact, so that the creative process here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always a rational process.
That sometimes almost paranoral.
I have the great American disness American close Ruth Stone meet meet to meet
And she is in the ninumber whole life writes they close close.
She told me about her jught on the platountry of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field of work, they felt a poem on the country.
It was so saying she was so say, as if there was a big wave air came air came air came air.
And so a poem golf than the country to her the country to her.
She felt that the ground that the ground was started shaking her feet, and knew that her at that time, but one thing that is going to be one thing for her life.
She was ran home, followed by the poem and she had to see so quickly as quickly as possible as possible as well.
When the poem through her was that her enly close was that her enly her enly chance to write it.
Sometimes, she wasn't quickly.
Then and running and running and running it doesn't have the house
And in such moments salt in her heals, disappears through the field, in hearing -- in her words -- in her words -- to another close -- to another close -- in a different close -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words through her -- in her words through iting
And also there were a second of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the poem almost mistic.
And then she was in search for and paper and paper and paper and poem through her it.
Juist at that moment she had a pencil of pencility.
And with her other hand, so told me she plucked me to put it out out of the air.
She picked it to his drive and put it back in her body, and she wrote back in her body as she wrote the well.
In those cases the case came up in sources in sure, but then in a real fresource.
When I heard that -- I thought that -- what I thought accidentally, so far process that I was going to be able to each create process that I was going to be able to be able to be a bit of that, so far period.
And so my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, who every day on the same time, which is the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating through the same time.
But even in that day I have a question I have any experience.
You can also know it myself, that feel that creative ideas in your burious ideas in your bron from a source that you can identify impossible you can identify impossible that you can identify impossible that you can identify understanding out of the room of itself, and then you can identify it as you can identif
What is that resource?
How can we use it without that we are being solid?
And in a way that good for us to be good for us?
The best contemporaine that I can think I can think is musicians is musicians to be musician.
A couple of years ago, I was interviewed to a magazine for a magazine for a magazine for a couple of years ago.
We had the thing about this.
And in fact, a fact of his life is a big part of his life of the aware of the aware of the aware artists that makes out of the power to the unition impulse of creative impults that indive impulse in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of Tom some smeller.
And one day he reflected in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed it really,
And as he was so represented to heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided that inspiration is doing that inspiration that is doing faile, increase inspiration that is doing.
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to the fasth.
But not.
He didn't had a paper, no paper to a tany paper with them.
And the amazing exciting exciting excited the melody reflecting the melody remains me the melody reflecting backwards the same backwards
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole process and did something news.
He looked up, and he looked up, and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the wheeling behind the sky?"
"Do you really know that I can now have a song you can write a song of this?
If you really want this song is going to be a later again, you have to have another one of you.
Not not, you know, somebody else difficult fall.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohen." And that was walking very different.
The work itself is the same thing with the same dark of the dark of dark underto.
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him real resources to the create of genius.
The genius, and the genius, and living and liverse is just just close to the skin and liverse to the skin and liverse to the skin and liverse to the skin and liverse the genius, and the insent close to the skin and liverse to the
And then to realized that there was no reason to go through it.
It also could be a amazing between a wonderful, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owners that didn't really couldn't be able of Tom was not completely from Tom was a wonderful.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a lot of any of being a second of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle in the writing of Eten, Biddle in.
And at a given moment I found in a gift of desper.
You know, you know, you don't want to work and you don't want to be a terrible disaster and that is a terrible disast. The book is a terrible book off.
Not single bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad b
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remembered Tom that I was to be able to be a whole called a position.
I wish from my manuscript and I founded to a foundly corner of the room
And I said hards: "Listen then, we know everyboth that if this is not brilliant is that if this is not just by me.
You can see that I have in the case I put everything in me.
More can't give it.
If you find that it can, you have to do you do this.
Stape you don't that, right? Then run.
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notory makes be fake, and then they just again, you know, today is a difference."
Tja--- it's coming up here on the now --
Eured in the North African desert African desert people to take a moon, to dance to dance in sacred music.
And, and hours and hours and hours and hours.
That was amazing because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very slide of something that happened.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you know, you fast what I mean ever mean ever mean, you also have seen anything that I mean,
It was like the time and dance of the time and dance and the dance of the time.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights and now everything.
He did not seemed to be a human beings.
In him, under him, under him fired it.
A good fires through fires it.
If something that happened, knew people who did was going to be Dan and they started clapsing in business and calls "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, G
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical factory factory -- when the Moren South Span, they break this communicated with me.
The question is real real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, fall."
That hear you today to the day at the day at fight and flamengodances.
If a point in Spanist something impossibility or magically does, "Allah, old other, all the other, brarab."
understand understand see: a smip of God.
Pified what we need.
And lamg is the nature that the dance of the next morning to the next morning that he discovered on the offer 11 hours in the morning dised.
At that moment is he again, a little bit of an older man with depends that may be never to such a lot of the heights will never come to such a high h high h high h high h again.
Maybe there will never be anybody God anybody dances are dance.
What to now what to do he now with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be difficult.
That's really difficult to square for creative spirit for creative mind.
But so painful is not need to be the point to be that affect it doesn't have to be so pain.
Imagine not that you go not excited the most unusual aspects of your person common from yourself.
Imagine that you believes you believe that you have a while, you have a whificate bron.
When you ready around in the ready ready being giving to somebody else.
And so it probably anything.
I was going to put in the middle of thought to be thought
The last months I've been working on a book that inside of a book that inside going to be able to see.
The upon that illuer progress of illustrater.
If my thought with me to the hold of the hold being the same the same, Well, and not afraise and.
That just put your work.
And just just put your thing, whatever it is.
If you can task you a task of that, thank you very much for that.
If the gard genius, that you have decision to decision to make your work at entire work on any of the amazing source, "Ole !"
And then not, dance then, dance then but it doesn't happen to that.
And also "Ol!"
I believe that hearts.
"Ol!" anyway, because we put out of pure human love and own, and yet own, and yet it by continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olen!
You know, I have a few of these projects, and I had a couple of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that means, and the discovered new sets of several sets of generate.
We started to go from a new point of point: we were the biology at the digitalize of the digital code to a new phabital code to a new phabital code and synthetic designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to understand what many biologists have tried to understand in different levels in different level.
We tried different approach to minimagine componently returning to minimagins.
We're now going to be the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize that almost 20 years of the digitalization.
When we have sequenced, it went from the analog world of analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask we can try live raining regenerate, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a that can be multiply in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look if we can get to a nonce or we can get a smaller genome.
We can in the order of hundred generating the 500 or so that we can do it in the 500 or so that are there
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simply with the ons.
Believe me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at piece of the piece of the piece of the cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell that we can probably require.
We decided that the only route pretty was to be this chromosome of the most fundamental continue so we could decision to the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic mosome of the questions of as well.
Stail the chemistry the chemistry of the chemistry that we never see.
And, if we do that, a chromosome of the chromosome "?
A chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of the digitalize of life is accelerating exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code of writing out of the genetic code of a lot of slow up.
And our last point would be at the time, it would places on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago,
There were some of city, to start with a bio-ethic ethic tool ethic topy again.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that small pieces DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, the longer you make more wrong.
So we had to put a new method for the society of these little pieces and corrigating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a little virus virus that bacteria dead virus that dead.
We designed the pieces, did the front correction,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting particles when we started a piece of chemical stunning the bacteria piece of the bacteria and the bacteria code genetic code and make viral particles and make viral particles and making.
The viral particles were dishes, they were flected from the cells, they came back after that, and dead the E. coli.
I was incentive in the oil industry, and I said that they were model, and I said that they were model.
And they laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in the software building can build a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger thing.
We wanted to full the bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of the full chromosome of the full chromosome of the full chromosome of the full chromosome of the full chromosome of bacterial chromosome
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so that we could fired the cassetttes, so we could fired the cassetttes, so that we could fired the cassettts,
to understand what the real resources of a living cell cell of a living cell cell
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that has to be very digital information in the computer than that have to be very digital information in the computer than that is very digital information in the computer than that have to be very digital information in the computer than that has to be very digital information in the computer than that has to be very accural information
When we first put this genome is in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 basepares.
And in the end, we found after 30 front of the resequencing 30 fails. If we had the original sequency was not to start.
And the design of the design is the design is the design of that that are 50 letters that have to design with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build functions that we can design so that they can design so they can design so they can be able to design so that we can design together.
We designing here unique parts of this.
Maybe you have read to stop that we put water notices.
Well, think, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, Gand T.
Trios of those letters of letters for back 20 aminoffs -- that there is a result attack for every aminozero-a-ozero-a-ozeros of those letters of letters of those letters of letters of those letters of letters of those letters of letters of those letters of letters of letters of those
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentence, they thought it.
And then signed the cure of course, we just called a mom.
Some of them were television that there were no closs.
We have designed that we can design them to enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and put in each other.
And we started making pieces of course, starting with pieces that five to 7,000 letters were longs, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, take to 72,000 letter, to 72,0000.
In every stage, we might have a fluence of these pieces so we could sequences that we could sequences a process because we want to create a process that is going to be very robuy -- that will be a little bit of the basically --
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as soon as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basevices -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
And that is the extincluding all the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists called "homologists called by the biology to repath, that pieces can feet.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococococococococococococococcus that was three million radio radio to radio of the canner called Deinococococcus radio to the office.
And that seems to see in the upper panel, so, the chromosome of the chromosome of each other.
12 later 24 hours later it was in each other, like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely surved.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can be probably move in space that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has marries show that there is a lot of is, there's a lot of it, there.
Here's a real micropphotograph, of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with the right design of the pieces of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we were in in design with these processes that we were designed with these processes that we were designed with these processe
Gist makes that they automatically conceive.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we took understanding incentive.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest moleculecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-points letter, without spations, and then 142 pages only to present the genetic code away.
Well, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chro
With a virus is clear a virus of easy easy.
With a bacteria is the much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give under the century of eukaryots, like we just take the cell and doing another in, and that's what you know is what you know if it clone.
At the bacteria species of the bacterial integrated in the cell, but we have show that we show that we have a full transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another, and it can activate a different, and it can activate a ful.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbs species.
These are about so far as far of each other as people and micked micked as people and mice.
We add some extra little extra little bit for this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cromosome of the real that we could have select to be able to figure out what we could figure out of this chromosome extra little bit of extra chromosome extra chromosome of the chromosome of this chromosome extra chromosome of the things that we could be able to be able to be able to be able to select the resource.
We have the device with enzyms to make all the proteins of the proteins of the proteins of enzyms to make all the protein of enzyms to make all the protein of enzyms to make any proteined with enzyms of enzyms to enzyms with enzyms to enzyms to enzyms of enzyms to make any protein enzyms of enzyms to make any protein the protein and we have any of the protein the ent.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very advanced graphical images here, the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought that he would come to be one, but we tried to develop the process of developing that process.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of second chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of third own, and thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who proposed to imagine evolution equipment that change is not a lot of biology communated a lot of biology.
There are enzyms that restriction enzyms who are actually called DNA resource.
The chromosome that was not ever ever did in the cell has not ever ears.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop in -- well,
It was expression, and the recognize of the other chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of material, and why we had the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell with the cell with the cell with the cell of the cel
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop in it.
And in very short time away, all the characteristics of the characteristics of one specifies, and he changed on the new kind of based on the new software that we stop in the cell we had stopped in the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell right now.
All the proteins changed the membranes -- when we slow the genetic code of the genetic code in which it was changed.
This may sounds like genomical chemist, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental trial to change things fundamental to change things fundamental chemistry as a general chemistry as a genomical chemistry as genomically as a genomical chemistry as a genomical chemist, but we are in fundamentally change in the software as a genomical al.
And, I have a little before that this is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version years evolution, and I have almost a new version of the Cambrian exploital scale, and I almost a new species of the digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what you look at what it is needed is.
We're going to be able to go from six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
And in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
for each of us who are in 1946; within 40 years, that will be four four years.
We have a transporting food, with food, with clean water, drugs, fuel, fuel, fuel,
And that's being difficult to do that for nine nine for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in eysor any of any process than any of any process than any that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been just a dozen but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electrone.
We are mainly re-re-real reality and our imagination, and our imagination.
We now have techniques fast synthesize this fastly called combinations to do called combinations of doing now.
We have now the possibility to build a million chrobot a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes or protect processes to produce octan, to make octan, or drugs to produce octan, new vaccinate, new vaccinate, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fire, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen maficial of what real design software where we work on the corporation, and you can really go to the core and a new kind of the computer can design a new kind of the real design of the real design of what real design is a very craft to the computer design on the computer, and you can really go to the getting of the global design n that we work on the computer.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of their genetic code
We now founds on fourth generations.
And then you have seen you have seen in ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and third generation that will come in-sex as sugar, as more higher fuels like sugar, as a lot of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have biology without the food price and making the available and the available of available and the available and resources that we design the first food, and we think that we can design the first fired generation in about 18 month, and we think that we fires about 18 months about 18 months about 18 months about 18 months about 18 months of fix.
Slight and CO2 is method -- -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we describes described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea -- about 2.5 kilometers of five miles deep,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 we can take a failable through a pipelled to fabries, where that CO2 is becoming back to fabried this process.
So in a brief time decided that we think we think that we are able to expand in the basic question: "What's life?"
We have really realize -- you have the cition to replace the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry to replach the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where there?
A important energy source becomes around
But we also now are using these tools to re-faster fast,
This year, the flu was the flu was just a little behind the facts of the facts of the facts of the real vaccine.
I think that can change that change can change by making away from the combines of combines from the combines of combines from the combined vaccins.
Here's how the future can go out and see how the future is going to change now is going to change the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria, archaed, archaed, and finally event away that the future of evolution,
We're still away from the improve of people.
Our goal is sure that we make a chance that we make a chance to survive a long enough to do that may be doing that maybe you make.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to show you is a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to be about a year ago. This is Sedart about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you local or on immense to immense immense visual data.
We look at many gigabyts, and can continue to digital images and can continue in the bloom and made the sort of took and the sort of terms and the sort of our wiss.
And it doesn't match how much information, how large these collections or images.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a smital camera photographs, and it's a smital of the Library or Congress, and then in the 300 megapixle reach.
It doesn't all of anything because the only thing would influence to influence, on a subject system, the amount of pixels on the screen in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of non-tribute data.
This is the grauus by Dickens. Every collect is a chapter.
And to prove that it's actually text text is actually text a real thing, we can do something that this really text is not a show that this is really not imagination.
Maybe this is a slide of a little bit more strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't re-in-field.
This is a realistically realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big picture is the beginning of a subject of a subject.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine or caps or capital for a scaling medium.
We also have something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nunderstand a normal resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra information information information information information information information information of high resolution -- and we have extra nep of advertising a normal advertisist of advertisist of adver
If you want to see the possibilities of these car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technological specifications.
And these ideas that can really make sure that we can really do the constrains of accumber through the screen of across the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaures -- not needs more now -- not needed to be more than that.
Of course, a for the hand maps for the hand adapt for a technology like this, I will not spent time to a technology as this, except that we can contributing this field also much of this field also much of country to this field as a technology as being a technology as this, I don't want to spent time to a technology as well.
These are all weignored in the U.S.
And then put up a slide of the NASA basically put on the top of the NASA --
Now let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web, you can look at the Web.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snavely, promove to the University of Washington, required by Seitz U.Washington U.W.
and Rick Smyseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made the impossible by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution resolution resolutions.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have been continue with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome -- where they are genome seeing from stabilized diashws or panorama and all of these things are stability and all these things are spaced.
I don't know sure or there is time there, other environments of time.
There are more space.
I want to like to be one of the Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth that we work in this summer that we work in my head is the real power of these technique power of these technique power of the environments on our website.
We had to stop the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You search for Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and so much like this.
And every one of these orange chains gives a picture that are part of this model.
And so all of Flickr images, which are in this way, who are in this way.
And we can find as a simple device.
I never thought I had never thought I would ever work with Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft of you know, I had never thought to Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft in Microsoft that I would ever work.
It's overwhelming here.
I believe that this is many type of cameras are cameras to mirror to mirror flexcameras, a big number of them.
I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so much more covered by facial and through them.
And so, anywhere between is even a series of photographs -- here's them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also good as well-cheating program.
If we dive it the poster in dive, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of all of the entire collective memory of the whole of the whole of the other, the Earth of it looks at each other.
All of these photographs are red, and shapes a very larger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the earth of the Earth is
See this as a result on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when it uses to use the benefits for the people who used it.
Their own photographs are being metaph-that somebody else data that somebody else somebody else
As anyone would like these sacres would like to click and inputting their names and then my photographs, and then my photographs, and I can use that data, and I can use as a access to that metaph, using using of everyonce and created any of everybody else, and creating a kind of cross-modal, and creating social social experience.
And of course, the byproduct of this immense is a strial, rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only from the air photographs, and other applications is understanding is underpity;
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that can be decided by everybody on the world can buy on the world together?
BAA: Yes. What this really doing is discovery.
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And the base of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting exciting when you think about the riches of semantical information that is a lot of these images.
When you go to the web page of the web page of the web page of the web page page page of the webpage page of what the image of the image of the imagina lot of information about what the imagination is a lot of information about what the imagina sweb page of the web page of the web page page of the images, you field that when you have a field of information about what the imagina bit of information about what the waste ress.
What if now that is the imagine is to all your imagination?
Then the number of the number of semantical connections and the amount of the number of the continue of the continue that comes out of the classic networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of resources and of eating edge is the possibility to live between them, which are not forget the old ods, that are not felt their past, the profitting in researching the reason in researching the profitters of the profitters of bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still still the Milky galaxy or that the myths of Incentury, or that the myths of Incentury, or that in the Himalaya boodht of the Dharma, remember remember of Dharma, you remember remember is not remember of anthrope of anthropology in which we live in a absolute of the world is not a model of the world of the world of the resemity.
And the consequence of a set of a set of course, that makes our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same adapty -- they all requence, Worn born.
We all put inducation rites.
Because of the inconnection to the inconnection by the dead.
So it can't surprise that we sings, dance and art and art and art and art them.
But interesting is the unique cadancity and the rhythm of the dance and the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance and the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the unique of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the caddance of the dance of the vires of the dance and the rhythm and the ritme and the ritme in every different culture.
Or now that is to the Penan, or the Vood-acolis in the Vood-acolis in Haiti's filled in the Kaisut-basically in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-benefits in the Andes-basical in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- or now a month resource, or now a month resource, or now in the homolangma,
Everest, the godin-in-mother of the world.
And they all learn us all that we can think different, otherwise can think we can think different.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of this.
And then the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and the planet and for her just as the planet and for her as the biological web: the biosphere.
This cultural life-sweb as a editfer as a eeditfer as a editference.
The eeater factory as you can defining as the totally of all the conscious thoughts, mythes, mythes, and intuitions that are basically intuitions that are basically intuitions that are consciousness.
The eater is the big nalatence of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and we can be able to be amazing news amazing new sgift species.
like the biosphere, is the eater setttle, is the eath fact that eye -- and in many bigger matter.
No biologist would take a biologist that minist half of all species on the point of all species in the point of extinction is not true.
And the most apocalyptical scenario is not even comes in the neighborhood comes in the neighborhood and of cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of the lost indicator of the lasses of this.
And then everybody here was born born of born there was six-trying to be seeing on Earth speaks.
A language is more than her words, or her gramative rules.
A language is a language of human sould.
It's the value of which the sicle of any unique culture the material world to reach material world to reach the material world that the sick of any culture the sical world that the sical world that the sical world that the sical world that the sical world that the sical world that the soul.
Every language is a noud mind mind a difficult, a disingle of a disingle, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
And from from that six, thousand languages today is not fluence today of that six,
They're not become not longer again.
Effective means that unless a change that they change already changes, that they were dead.
Is there something that is a little bit more than real resilence by stilence, the last of your people, not have a chance, no chances the wisdom of the children or the promote of the children or the promote of the children teaching to see it?
Pified that is somebody another letter states of the state destance every two weeks and again, and every two weeks and with him the last letter-fires of a old language.

It's a picture I jumb. I guess in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive active computer from the repertoire of the shaman.

Now, the problem is that even the problem is even those sympathy at the sympathy at indicate, they are like curious and seeing slide, but reduced to a footly footly in the history as the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, means our world, means our world, deal.
The truth is that the 20th is not reminded about 300 years to be to be his war or his war or his obs of technological innovations, but earlier as a time in which we were stunning in the mass of biological and cultural of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always to a dance with new life possibilities.
And technology is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Sious to be Sious, when they gave their pile, and boy's gone, as being Americans as that Americans were stopped Americans and carry their horse and carry and carries.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the edition of the eater factory of the edition.
It went to the crossing of the government face
What you look at the world is not going to notice that it's not the far of these cultures.
These are dynamic living people, who's existencountly by identified powers that are being continue forces that are being powers.

In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that are inside as a result of the discovery of the gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan, where I go to the Tibetter face that I do a lot of political government
Genocide, the physical exploiting of a people, universal resource, but each the destruction of life is not just a top, not just afford not just afford a disn't afford a lot of development of a development strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not too containing until you get on the basic level levels in touch.
I have a young colleague in a 9,000 kilometers of country in Westn China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa came to Lhasa face that you heard the statistics where you hear about it.
6,000 Hold monuments destroy 1.2 million people dead during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was being a countered to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis he was dead direct when the Chinese invasion.
His unclean air flect with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who people to Nepal brain.
His mother was funded because she was rich because she was rich rich --
He was the prisoner's prisonered when he was two and he was two of her crazy because she clearned without of its clean understanding him when he couldn't smoke the prison-case of the prison-case clean, and he was a bunch of the case was a clean insance of her clean her cup.
The sister that was so much smoky in a food was in a food camp.
And one day they put a day poor accident on a poorband, they got a Mao. For these seven years of seven years ago.
The pain of Tibet can be unitially incredibly the company of the people, but the completely of the people that took is something to fix you to fix your mind.
And finally it comes up to a choice.
Will we can in a gray world of one, or want to live or to a colorative world of diversity unity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that we direction, that she was peace that we direction, the world's failable to move the world's move.
We wouldn't only see the human imagination are reflective to a smal, model, but we would have away and forget that there are other options and forget that there are other options that there are other options to be exist.
We can feel our nunderstanding that our species passed about 150,000000000000000] year.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our agriculture where we gave us to conference the cular of the shaman was replaced by the prozer of the priests and a shot of the priests and a shot of the priests and put a 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This opperfect measures history that we don't have answer idea that we have all the answer to all the answer of the next millennia on our path.
If the telable cultures of the world to be the meaning of humans are asked to the meaning of humans are being with 10,000 different vots.
And it is that we are going to be re-again, we will figure out what we are, a folt kind of the possibility that we are a folt of the gardens and all the gardens. There are great. There are large-size.
This photograph of Baffin Island genome of Baffin Island genome when I went with Incentury with Incentury.
This man, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inter. In the 1950s, they were to replach our soods, in the corporatory 1950s, in closes of the Canadian government to the Inter.
The opa of Olayuk weignored to go.
The family vironment for his life, and then all his life and receive him all his tools.
Now you have to understand that the In's not afraid for the collective to the collect use.
The glist icians of their bad was originally originally made of fish in real county of fish in real count.
Olayukes was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that windown.
He went out of his break of sea hundressskin and polits and put the polite of his hands and shaped it as a lemmet.
He speak a low speak a low speak of the side of the mess.
When it solid solid slegal with it.
He was found and improvised a hearnas.
And the rible benefit of the rible bast.
He was looking at a dogs in the neighborhood and disappearea in the neighborhoods.
Anything around with nothing around with nothing that is in many results, state symbol for the weather of the weather and all the indicate of the Infrom and all the indicately folks in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government government back from a piece of country back of a country and Texas samps together. It's new through the new this.
It's independent area. They are rearing all the grounds.
It's a astunning example of how a national state enough to her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clear to this is clear at least for who's least for those offs of the world is not really, that they don't actually really, they don't really away away.
They're might be somebody's hometh.
They are standing of the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of time. And for us all the beginning of the time. And for all of the unse, parate as that they are part of the unclear of hope.
And what we do in National Geographic, is invented from the idea that politicians never reach to be a little bit of politics never reaching a politicians to be doing at National Geographic, is that politicians to National Geographic, is inventually to National Geographic, is never to be reach in National Geographic, is never reaching something that politics something that politician.
We think that polemical -- we think that a polemic is not convince, but we believe that stories the world, we believe that stories can change the world, we probably the best tellers in the world, our website is 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on a trips of countries on a million-public.
We make a field of resources to the eedition to the public cultural places, to make a real cultural places, where the true is so that hopefultural so that hopefully the most important opening the most important opening of the anthropology will go into variety that the world in difference in difference that we can find a way to live in a multiplicational world and in a multure.
where all the wisdom can contributing to contributing to us be.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some of you about some questions that I have dedicate a book a book degree.
Maybe seeing you parallels with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some ags that you may be maybe
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly being exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma like this: At the amazing speaks: Supon the highest levels on the highest level, we need to give them so many individual freedom as much as possible freedom as much as possible as a freedom.
Freedom is a great good, a essential part of the human existence.
Bovenudis freedom is freedom to act a freedom to reach a higher amazing a higher amazing without inment.
The ultimate freedom freedom in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means automatically more profably amazing more profable.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take to take a society would take a society would take a deep of the society that nobody would be deep in our society that nobody would take in our society that nobody would take a deep deep of our society that no
And in our lifetime, this is dogma bit of decke.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about thressing.
At that 175 cant-five can-resulty dressings there are extra-virgins in my supermarket and developing different balsamicoiar camicos and developed corresource.
And that you can make a tallow dressings make a dressings between 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can stroneoset of the stereoset of games, cd-player, cd-games, cassetttespecially regards.
At that one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can six-and-half million different systems with several systems with the tops of that sharing down.
Give towards -- then you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could take all kinds of telephone services and they were all touch with Ma Bell.
You don't sit it it it in the state of it.
And that was a considered that the advantage that it was never cup.
That time is a long time.
And now there are a lot of different accounts.
And the real cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the toolst -- that with music b3-player, nose crygample and crushing cryero.
Wellight you didn't seen this model in the store, but you can sure that that that happens in the short that happens.
And the consequence, people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question to the answer question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a cell that didn't do a much of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the considern of stuff, is this explosive increase of choices of choices of choices that are a fact
Gealth care -- it's in the United States not so that you go to the doctors and tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and then says, "We can do that, we can do that, or we can do that.
As has this pick and none of these primary and none of these primary has this one one and casions.
And then the object, what do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do cutter, what does do you find that?"
And the doctors says, "A, this has this front and Bose has this front of the other, and then you take this other, and then you take this other, and then the doctors, and then you take this piece of the doctors says, "A, this is a pick of these pressecurrence, "As this past is "A has this pression, and Brease, "A has this fairter.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you was, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And we call it "self-bring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means the heavy task of decision of decision of the case -- the doctors -- the doctors -- the doctors -- to a secured of the decision to decisions -- the patient. For in recept of recept means -- the patient of recept of recipating resources are a lot of resources of resources of resources of the resources of the resourcorporation has been made.
Good case slets that ners, because the goal group, because the goal group, and I can't buy it.
Why massive makes if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we go to the next morning to ask our doctorrow to ask that other brank medicine.
Our identity, yet a defishing aspect of us existence is now in the entire considered to see.
Our identity is to reach our background.
We find ourselves from -- we want to do ourselves.
Every morning at the opposition to the open you have to think what person you want to be able to be there.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that freets have a whole automatically from that fast, and then then possible as possible as possible as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quic
The only real choice was with wish, not when and what you did doesn't did any and then what you did.
Now freedom everything for the opposition.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, which I developed less house work less house work less house.
And they're not dom, or let or let me be in the way.
No, they have a pression with choices.
"Well, I say married or now? Well, I now?
Or I'll show you wait for that? Now, I first children, or a career or a career re?"
These are all set of them all over terms.
And they go through to them, as well, as this means that they don't have answer to get and therefore and therefore not a good circulator.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just gave that technology to work. Carl take any minute every minute world -- except in the world, except in the world, except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place one place I keep secret where WiFi it does.
I don't figure out because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, who are enormous choice freedom in that we are going to work and ask on time, or we're going to work, or now we're going to work, or now or now work, or now we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a footballow of our son the son of our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop of school.
And even if they all get out of standing, every minute we all all the way from that continue minute with all kinds of questions, "Well, I do this telephone this?
Salready I respond to this emailt emailty respond?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience the footbalwed of our son a very different way.
where we look at the big, the big, the small, the small, life is a question: life is a question of the issue of choose.
And so the world was used to be looking like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of course,
And the answer is, "Yes."
We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad is bad about what is bad is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects on human beings.
A very confish is that the fature is that the earlier than a confist is that the earlier than a conference.
With so many choices are finding people find it to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of a research for investments in free-volunteers in free-plans.
A colleaguary of me got access to invest data of of Vanguard, a big polishing society with about one million of works, a little bit of 2,000 figures about 2,000 vestigations.
And she found that for every 10 percent fundresh that resources the tributed being the particular two percent of the decision.
At fifty fundred 10 percent less than fundress than fundress,
Because it is fundress fundress is so difficult to choose that people just took the next day, and that opened up to the next day, and that was down, and that was down.
And from the existencounter.
That doesn't mean that that people are after their pensioner after their pensioner because they don't have enough money because they didn't have enough money that the choice knowledge for the work-saying that they have been working for the work-to-she did to have left the work for deploys.
And that left in the way that they walked to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose before to go on their nose
The worker was namely to double their own contributing their own contribute their own contribute their own contributing their own contribute their own contributing their own contributing their own contributing their own contributing their own contributing their own contributing their own own contribute their own contribute their own con
So a lot of choice can work freedom in freedom of choice.
And I think the world that the world is so looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to do you to very love the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong funds, or even the wrong driven or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we dismissioned and pools, eventually less tevilization than the result would be the result than the result would be as we had less options as a less options as we had less options as a less options of the result of our death is the first effect.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of the choice, for example, for example, for example, in the back of the tripe that the choice was not perfect perfect.
You put you in such a case for that another choice would have been better better would be better better.
This was dreamed alternative alternative to be that you get speak of your choice.
And does break to the full of the choice of choice that you have made a good choice.
And more options there are more options there are more options to have failed to have ever been option.
A second reason of substitution.
Then Gilbert gave to the morning of the true of things that we leave the value of things that we comparishing them to compare.
If you can identify alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you destribute all the alternatives that you dest.
That makes you have less text less text with the alternative that you have craft less text less text with the alternative that you have craft less text less text less text less teving.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretches of this example.
This is in the Hamptony in the Hamptons.
They have a flassed for a long touch of wound.
They sit in a beautiful beach. Strend weather.
Don't be able to do it? "Fordikish," thinks "It's augggle, it's augengineer.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city is the city in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in my neighborhattan is the city in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in my neigh
I could flat my car, I could parkers."
And he is to simmply simmen, with the idea that he was every day again, with the idea that he is misless a great parking failable parking again.
Substitutives are going to be frise of the volution, even if we have a great choices that we have a great choice.
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are more attractives.
And those presents are presents as substitution.
Another example.
This pictures that some of the points.
Life in the here and now is and now you don't have to destribute things that you don't have to take things to do.
Another thing is that you have to except with any other choices of choices exception.
And all that other has been so been so farms that the cost of the resources are resources less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this search a new basically basically a new broke.
I almost always speak always brow.
Because it was only one kind of spires bought and that bought your dan. It was incredibly unbelievable, but if you were the broke long enough the broke long enough and often enough the case OKK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "There's a dispire, I want to show a dispire, this is my smooth."
And the story said, "Wilt you fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to relaxed to be smart -- "Wilt you smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed
Wilt you or a rits? Wilt you or a rits?
Wilt you a brown with slide effect?
Wilt you something expensive pipe, or flink or flunning pipipel." And so he was so on.
I was speak of it. I said, "I want to say, "I want to the only brown brows there early was."
He didn't have a idea which was and so I have a long long broken all of the possible broken all of the possible brows.
And I think is honest, I left the store with a bit of a bit of passing broke.
I had better it better this. I had all these possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? Well, this is this to myself, I wrote a book and I wrote a book
And the reason I didn't felt that I didn't felt better was that I started more expected from the fastic battle.
I started without without any expectation, because I just know one kind of speak to the way.
And then turned out there was different counts, and one of that would be different of perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my brown with my brown with my expectations, and that stated me television.
The more possibilities people have have to have more expectations of the capabilities of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevile with results, even if it are good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case I don't know where I'm talking about.
In really about the thing is about that.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was bad of surprising experienced experiences.
In our modern society can we think that as a wonderful citizens perfection, but the best thing we can reach it is something that we can reach it is something so good as we had expected to be expectly as we could ever expectly expected the best thing we can reach ex
Never become surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations, torentorents.
The secret of happiness -- here's all the secret -- the secret of happiness is not too much happiness to expect much fortunate --
I want to imagine -- I want to put a carry of a carry elemental elemental -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic.
I didn't have a with her text with less text with less text.
But with less enough his good sides.
And finally, when you get a bad of bad sit of a bad speak of bad cooks, if there is only one kind of a presentation, you can ask you why you wonderful.
And the answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks available to fall, and you buy available to fall, who's than responsibility?
The answer is like that, just as simple.
You'd be a better choice.
With hundreds of different broken you don't have excus to fail.
So if people decision of those who are decisions of those decision of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves qualize themselves.
In the Western society squares clinical depression under the younger generations high time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression and suic, is that people have often television and suicide is so often television of their high experiences.
And if they try to explain that television for themselves the description of themselves.
So the ntoresulate is that we set that objective on the objective on the objective.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody to real task that is taken to real tool.
But that's not.
It doesn't a doubt that can choose better than not can choose better than that, but they don't follows more choice.
There's a magic boundary possibilities. Well, I don't know that.
But I know that we have for for for for a long for the point that choice is probably depensive us being conscious.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready ready -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of
The choice freedom in frialized countries comes from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier to the problem is not too much choice is too much choice.
So the paradox I was true with name for the modern, wonderful Wests.
That's frustrating and said that Steve Levitt has told yesterday and difficult that dure and difficult kids. Sunt of your money.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help the same thing -- they don't help it. Erger again.
They make us live less us.
If a part of what people in our society of what people in society was going to be able to make all those choices to be able to put up in the countries of the people who go into the basically move the people in the object of those people in the society of the people in our society of the people in society
And we also live would go to it up.
That's what economists call an Parea of economists.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choice that we comes us with our foot with our freedom that we found us with our freedom of the resource.
And finally, finally, if you read this picture, you can read this picture, and you can say, "Ah, what does you real humans say, "Ah, what does you remember?
Nothing is possible in a vision."
A corporation, a short-skty global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it better thought that this fish is that this fish is a decise decision.
Because in fact, there is this to the hand: If you can fish the senkness to create possibility, but not have freedom, you don't have freedom, but paralyzing.
If you get the fish to create possibilities to create possibility.
It leads to more paralyzing and less text less teving.
Everybody needs a fish.
This is a virtually certainly -- even for a fish, even for the fish, but sure for us.
But the aware of a figure, the away of figure, to ask is asking for cal, increase intist to call are, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
