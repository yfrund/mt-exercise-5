And last year I show these two slides to show that the polar cap, that the polar cap, that the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the worse of the most particular problem because it shows not the dicatch of the ice of ice put the ice of the ice of ice.
The ice kap on the Norse pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and craces in summer.
The next slide I showed is a version of what happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is duned in red.
And as you see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the yearal ice ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or older, is almost like blood, that is almost like blood, that sky squeeed.
In 25 years of this is going to be like this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the Norse Icelsa and warms and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon clearning carbon diother, when it was dead, by microbes in methan.
Compicies to the total amount of atmosphere, in the atmosphere, it could double double the corner.
In some of the undirty anyboard in Alaska break of all of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another team to another team to another undeep me.
Whoo! Whoo! She's asking is real or we will be that we will be able to be us.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtextbon" Greenland from the north warms.
This is a small-flass.
The water volume is more bigger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legs is because it meless the landics of landics because it melvates the sea where it comes in the sea legs.
These currences are fligh.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Poll, on the South Pole on the Earth.
And last month, scientists scientists that the entire continent now has a negative ice balance balance balance balance.
More specific is the ice of the south of the south pole quickly quickly a few any couple of the south islands.
The whole continent is six meters of six meters are sea legs.
In Himalaya, the two biggest ice mass, there are new now there, there's new now that were a few years ago, which were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water from that mely.
In the Andes, this glacial city.
There are now more currents.
But when they disappeared, disappears the drinkwater.
In California reduction of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservoires.

Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intention.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours --
25 miles tons every day in our oceans, look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, west, from America, west, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drops of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great causes of the warming of the Earth, next to earth, which is burning for 20 percent money is furning fossil fuels.
Oither is a problem, and step is a problem, and it's all the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest exercisions, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build much more step centers.
But we see a reverse --
These are the spinal centers that the building was annulearned in the last years, and where green alternatives were presented to the last years.
There's a political battle on the country.
The voice carbon and oil-oil industire 250 million dollars to promots, which is a clean.
And that image me me about something like this.
And the Chiest of the Christs was at me at home in Tennessee, about four billion liter carbon model,
You probably seen the news face.
This is the biggest dependuring fall in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

We think it's clean clean -- and it was still clean.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me go over and let's over.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean carbon carbon carbon carbon center.
Fantastic! The machines are best what lawy.
But that's the sound of clean carbon clean technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the fact that the burning causes of the warming causes of the warming causes of the Earth is changing clean embarn clean technology that you see everything.

The red is in all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like policy coffee and immportunity of fossil coal and immediated oil.
But now there's a durfe, new solution to get this.
And found America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work America safer and a plan that makes us safer and warming the Earth of the Earth counter.
And eventually a solution that is sure that is sure to solution our problems.
Repower America.

Al Gore: There's an old African speaking that says, "If you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
If you want to go to and say, "I."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an ups with an update about how that machine.
So here. And for those of you who weren't allow: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever substance, 27 kilometers in reverse.
It must the conditions near the conditions that were present less than a billion after the universe started to 600 million times a second second by 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitiousl!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of detectors and this is called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter -- 22 meters in diame.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in building so you can see.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party certain party camerior.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the way around the LHC went around the LHC go, and with a piece of the LHC, and put particles in the detector of the LHC, and put particles in the detector of the LHC went out of the LHC go, and with a piece of the first particles of the LHC go, and with a piece of the first particles in the detector of the LHC and down the read with a picture of the LHC and I went around the whole of the LHCup, and HCome was going to be fready of the HC, and I was going to be ctest ctest cround the detectest ctore was going to be ctest clablevertort cline of the deteck of the deteach, and was doclase was actually
In other words, when we saw that picture picture that picture on 10 September we were working on the machine works, which is a huge win.
I don't know if this was the biggest of the biggest of the biggest page and this, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page looked like this.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golds week with these golds did wear.
And those wears ago and thousand amper pass when the machine on fully force the machine.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too little wear. It's too little wear."
They can do that because they superceive are all low temperaturs.
So at multi-degrees colder than the space between the stars, that can read that wear power that told stream being too.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructiful.
And that was the wire was something warmer, and it was there was any electric weather against 13 thousand amper chase.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realize that those magnets more than 20 tons of away that these magnets were moved to move inches over 20 inches were moving.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out what we did.
We all have referred them.
Now they're back to away.
Eind mits the LHC will be intact.
We will put it again, and we expect measurements in June or Juni, so we can go further and expect what the building stones the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is going to be able to go to expect it again, and expects it again.
Now, of course, that have that unhappiness the debate of the value of science, the value of science.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard, the fact that we go beyond beyond things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I suspect the decement of his students, his students, his students, his students, his students, his students, his students, Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous than the human spirit of the science of human beings, that there are no respirit finitions of the scientific that our results are completely definiting that our governments are totally define."
Thank you.
I would like to start asking you go to your childhood back to your childhood time, when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to go to grain and they pick up and wood, you were actually moving up and removed by learning and depending space and depending space and depending space and depenters of space relationships.
And Rumulti-insight is a strong because understand the world to understand us.
If an information inspired by the narrative by physical interaction with objects -- together with my advise Pattion and my compassion -- I started asking me -- what if we use a computer Jeevan -- what if we use a computer -- what if we could use a computer as a kind of digital fingertifull fingers that we can use a kind of information that moving moving to a place of information that moves are counting with being indictive fyond with being information that we could be able to fissue to founds like a fied information in the hyable to do with being information and information movitation fingertter,
and orders as we want to be able to orders and orders can we be?
This question was so being so being so being so we decided to find an answer by building building the building of Siftables.
Cort together is a Sift is an interactive computer size of a cookies.
They can be moving up with the hand they can be able to feel each other, their movement and they put a screen and wireless contact.
The corresponse is the physical trade is the physical trade, they can be moved by gray to gray through it.
Bovendies are Siftable, an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
And so that this tools have a more physical different of the physical different of their movement and even of the way we movement and even from the way we move them move, there's different new and fun interactions and we are proactivate.
I'll start with some simple examples of the simple examples of it.
This Sift is instance, to replicate, that by chancing a video that plays, and others plays, and others played and other.
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And the next to each other, they'll be interest.
If they get surrounded this and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to certain circulate.
And they feel movement and her movement and hell.
We algay that we algay that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the uses of all getting gets -- as it was a fluid getting a color as it was a liquid --
In this example three Sift emmarket and I can use them to use color in a embottle, where they are getting miled to get color in a empty and I can use them get.
If we have overfance, we go back some back.
There are some capabilities for education, mainly play play with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the ability to try and logical to try and logical result to see things that fast.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci calculating programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmmate.
And here we show you a game that a cruise between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Sift is that you get a prettty Siftable, and form did in a dictionary words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is being a rescued and appears a new series of letters with breakilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm indicated it to try it it it out to make it try to make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly nearly nearly instructions that people need to nearly instructions.
Everything you have to say "Make words" and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people to test.
That's our young base of tester, right-basically course.
And it seems to be just the Siftable.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting showed an interactive painting here.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
And he can bring new characters in the scene of the scene with that character the Sift with that character of the table.
Here's the sun coming up here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good though! Yeah! Yeah!
By the shapes of Siftable, and the next to each other, he can respond the characters -- Video: Wlly.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decisions how it divide.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have every Siftables and drue.
One has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in emptable, so that you can be injected pattern itself.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the pattern by a courable of effects as available, and filter.
They're added added and added by cancounter.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a lead.
Now I place the basline.
Video: DM: Now I feed a little slagwork.
Video: There I heads, I buy the filter to the filter to the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can celerate the country accelerated by the cans of blocky.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter to the filter to the basically expression.
Video: DM: I can repeak the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to plann, so it can improvise anything to be improvise, but I can improvise and make it all longer and corter as I want.
And it ended up the dims of the whole through the volume Sift to left shape.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make new people, my passion to make new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that our brains and bodies works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design region this design area of possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just just the against to a very new generation to a very new generation with digital media, that bring the information to the world as the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to you all and talk to you.
I'm writing this.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long life and I don't think that that that will change ever change.
And yet there is a recently something that happened in my life and career, and career and career, and I had to see my work with my work.
It started a book that I wrote unless I wrote a memoired me, a memoired -- Bime, that was very expect to my earlier world and an international existence the whole world and an international existenced.
And the result is that people are now and always to me, and always if I have to do it all as if I have to do it all the time.
World where -- it is doom!
People come to me and ask to me and ask sure you to say, "You don't know that you can never be success to never success this success
If you don't know that you will keep your entire life will be writing but never publish is going to publish that people will be heating hearm where people will be walk to hea?
If you don't have anything that?"
Eright-tool, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I was rarape that I was raraw 20 years ago -- I was a teenager, if I told that I was writing that I was writing 20 years ago.
People said, "You don't you afraid that you will never get success of success in success?
Don't you afraid for deal, that you will go through it?
Don't you afraid you live to this work without that it will be able to be able to extince, and you will be able to die in your broken with your broken with your broken with your broken bitters of bitters?"
Something in that strets.
And in the short comes my answer to that questions questions that "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called things.
All right.
But I'm also bang, you don't want to know that all of them to know what everything.
For instance, and other any things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that comes fear time that that comes fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically a lot of work that someone is too bang for the work that they put to their opinion Earth of work on Earth in the Earth of work on Earth is that anyone of the work that anyone is bang for the work that they were put to their opinion earth to their opinion that they get to their opin
What is so excition creative processes that we make sure that we make us to make the effects of minds, something that is not happened to work the effects of work together.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was asked ever asked ever asked him to be able to him or he didn't have any for that there was a bound.
And so said, "John, how is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, it was not solidly.
To be fair fair fair is certainly engineers have been crased by the centuries of manical depressive alcoholists.
Schriters well, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have been prettation to be instability to be instability.
Look at the grimming death the most magnificent creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by self.
And even those who are not suicide a bominess, seem to be able to be concerned to be concerned to be confused to be confused to be suict.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meiler every of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of excerces we don't look at anymore.
We all heard and heard and heard it all before all the accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity to connected with subject and an artist, and that a artist, and that will lead to experience.
And so I want everybody here today, you can ask today, you can you with that idea life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it is not think, I think it doesn't find the pretty thought.
I think it masincluded.
And also dangerous.
I would like to see this century that this century.
We can spirit to creative spirit to live better live.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to that dark thought life.
And it seems the fase where my career now is invention.
You're just took young, amper fires of fires years.
I can be able to be four decade four decades.
Head probably everything will I have published by the outside world as the world as the work that extraordinary successfully successful book.
We're here with friends up here with friends up here, so I can slow you know, higher my biggest success is already behind me.
Yem, what a idea!
If you go to think, you know, if you think of the morning to be neck hours already to the drink.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work that I love thought.
The question is, "Hoo?"
After long after long after long conclusion that I can only go through a psychological protection in the process.
I have to writing a safe distance between myself between myself and my overigents very much of the response to the response response to my future publish for the response to my future publications.
I have been looking at ways of doing it for ways to ways to do.
I do in the history and have been down in other civilizations to see if others have found civilizations that have found creative people to help creative people to help creative people to deal with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My question has brought me to the old Greeks and Romans.
You know, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Gree-old Greeks and Roman and Roman was not believed of themselves.
And believed that creativity was a dival spirit was a divable place to the humans were an included and unknowledges and unknowles.
The Greeks call these spirit was using creativity of creativity "demonen."
And so, Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that influenced.
The Roman had a kind of equalivalent idea.
And in fact, such a geniused creative spirit was a genius, a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, is not a particularly passociated piged of clear.
In their experienced was a genius, a kind of magic divied in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the human beings --
If the artist was working past, the genius, the genius,
And he was working shape shape shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I talked about the earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work was going to be work.
And the artist was protecting that was taken to many narcism.
If you brilliant, you got to get there.
Everybody knew that a invisible geniusible genius,
Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inpendent.
Long time, that was considered how in the West is creativity.
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a whole new idea: the individual human is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, again, sent from the dival world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believes that creativity came from the individual came individual.
And for the first time in history was talking about artists that they were said that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a great fair.
To one person, one person, one individual individual individual is the business of the century, the essenti, the source of everything that he or sources and known the familiar before -- that is too much too much of fragility for a fragility for a fragility for a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks you the sun in sun.
Egos are blowing up to a hugigantic proportions and there are incredibly high-expectations of experienced to be expectations of experienced to be able to couple of expectations and there are incredibly highly highly expectations of expectations and there's incredibly higantial proportions to
And I think this pressure the last 500 years many artists has made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different this?
Can we understand back to an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Wellight we can make 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes.
Probably sit in the audience people who have reading the scientific doubt double double creatures with some feeding the feeding of artists the work of artists to inspiring high-inspiring heights high-tempts of artists to inspiration and inspirational high-inspiring heights of the business of ar
It doesn't seem to get you all get to you.
And yet I wonder question I went to it.
Why not?
Why would we have to do that thought that thought that thought that thought that would be thought to be thought that thought that would be thought that would be thought that would be thought that would be thought that would be thought that would be thought?
It just just so much highly closely as much as all the other explanations of the total incity, that decided that decided that decided that decided to the creative process.
And everybody who has a bit has to be able to create something -- so in fact, in fact, all the presents -- you know that the creative process is not always rational contributes to be rational contributs.
That sometimes almost paranormally increase paranormally prettty paranormally prettty.
I have recently currency American closer Ruth Stone meet meet.
And she is close in the neinid. Her whole life writes then.
And she told me about her childher childher youth of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field was going to be a poems a poem on the country.
It was so told she said, as though there was a big wave wave came air.
And it was poems poem golf than the country to her it.
And she felt that the ground, she was starting to shake her feel and knew that her at that moment -- and it was just one thing to stand her life.
And she was running home, and she had to see it as quickly possible and paper.
When it close was poems her hunt waves her only to write it.
Sometimes she was not rapidly.
And then run, but run, it doesn't reach, but it doesn't reached the house.
And at the moments are focused by her her hear, disappears over the fields, looking for another closer words -- to another close -- to another closer words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her heal
And it was also much of it -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that she didn't have the poem -- that she almost miste.
And then she was in searching and pies, and piece, and piece through her it.
Juist that moment she had a pencil of packay.
And with her other hand, she pluced me the poem from the air.
And she picked it poems and put it back back in her body, while she wrote it back to its it up.
In that cases came the poem came in the case came in piece, but then in reverse follow.
When I heard that I heard -- which is so capable to be able to be able to creative process of my creative process of creative process of it.
And this is how my creative process is not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mile, who are a mouth of time, which is the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans blood, sweating through blood,
But even in that day was every day I had suddenly experienced that experience.
You will also know it myself, that feel that there creative ideas in your break course of a source that you can do it impossible you can do impossible to identify that you can do it inship.
What is that resource?
How can we use without that without we have crazy?
And on a way that it is good for us?
The best contemporaine that I can think I can think I can think I think I can think I have musician.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
And I was actually a big part of his life had been a big part of his life of the county artist that represents out all power to get to the unfortable creative impulation that tries to get incontinue to him.
With the years was Tom some restigation.
And one day he reflect in Los Angeles about the speed process and changed it radical.
And as he was so well, heard he heard a fragmental of a melodi.
It decided that fail is doing that failed does, ungray -- ungray welling.
It was a beautiful nice and he wanted to hold it it was a beautiful beautiful beautiful --
But it wasn't that.
He had no piece, no paper -- no tarps, no tancy at itself.
The amazing exciting exciting excited to him: "I went to the melody remains me every back to me euish.
I don't am any good enough, I can't it."
He does not be in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry heard that I behind the wall?"
"Do you really think I can write a song of the write of a song this?
If you really want this song is that song to be clater if I have time, you have to have time.
Now, this is how someone else did someone else difficult is fall.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohenborhoods at the process of the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is still familiar pigmental pound.
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him disappeared when he distanced the ength of enious of enious excited from the genius.
The geniused to close him to the skin and liver it was just just just faithing.
And then it was realized that there was no reason to go through it.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owners that not entially from Tom himself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a profoundly profounds.
I was writing in the writing process of Eten, Biddl.
And at a certain moment I avied in despair.
You know that you want to work you, you know, you don't want to be a terrible disaster and you think it gets a terrible disaster book it.
Not just bad, horrible bad.
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remembered Tom that they wish, and I decided to his genius, and I decided to carry a possible to carry a possible to be an attempt to be a possible of that came to his genius.
I wished me from my manuscript and I did to a corner from the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all this, we know all this is not book, if this is not just coming book, then it comes through me.
You can see everything I have in the stop I have in this way.
I can't give you through it.
If you find that it must be better way.
You know, you don't know that, understanding understanding understanding.
I just write down, because that's a long my work.
Oh, and in the notults are again, and it will be able to be able to the office of office are difference."
Tja--- United it comes here on down here.
Euves came up with the Norse African desert people together to dance came together to move months to move music music to move music
Urs and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes a little bit happened to be something like this.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you also have you also see, you also have seen a performer.
It was like the time silence, and dancing the patch of the patsisted before.
He nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights and it fully together.
And suddenly it was not longer bastic.
In him, under him, above him, above him, above him.
A diview fired fire, through it was a fire.
If such something that happened to be Dan exclass that was Dan they started to clap, and it was able to clap, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God."
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical factor: To the Moren Spange South Spange Spange pange conferenced this well.
The question is real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Oly, other."
And that hear you today that day is still fights and flamengodance.
If a population in Spanist something impossible or magically does, "Allah, OK, other, Allah, OK, bravoice."
Right? Steach, see, a glimpse of God.
Precipies what we need.
Lastig is that the dance that the dancer is discovered that he discovered that he discovered on dinctions of the morning is not divied a divieces more didn't have a diviece.
And at that moment is that moment is a little older man with decling with decline that may never going to come to come up.
Maybe never going to have anybody God to have anybody God and.
What do he now to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to square to square for creative spirity.
But so painful is not have to be able to be able to be able to be so painful as painful as it doesn't have to be so painful it.
Imagine that you don't have the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of your person coming out of your person coming out of yourself.
Imagine that you believe that you have a while of a little bit of a doesn't nather specificated from a source.
When you're ready ready to someone else.
That's how it is considered everything.
I handy infances that thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book that inside that will appear. The book that will be able to appeared a book that inside has been looking at a book for a long time.
The operating of that illuster previous.
If my thoughts with me the hall, I like to go and I still the same force: Don't be anything ance.
Do just do you work.
And just like you do this, what it is.
If you task you to dance, you know, thank you.
If the dival genius, that you have decision to make your work at any moment of the wonderful sources by lying by long, then "Ol.
Then not, dance then, dance it down.
And then, "Ol. Ole
I believe that heart.
"Ole anyway, because we pure human love and wisdom by human love and wisdom by still human love and wisdom by human love and well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I have this projects a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and covering new setts.
We actually start to go from a new point, we were the biology to digital code digital code to digital code from that digital code to a new phase of the biology, with the design and synthisis:
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand it was too understanding level to different level of different level.
We tried to get different approach again, it returned to minimum components.
We're almost 20 years.
When we have sequenced, it was the captured from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask sure to regenerate regenerate regenerate new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of multiply in a laboratory --
And we tried to look at if we can get a non-smaller genome.
We can put in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolic map, that relatively simple to the us.
Bely me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can probably expand it is very improbably improbably that this would be a living cell cell.
We decided that the only questional condition to synthesizing this chromosome of the most fundamental questions, to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, Can we have a chromosome synthesize synthesize synthesize a chromosome synthesi?"
So the chemistry is the chemistry of this very big molecules that we never see?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome clear """""""""""""
A chromosome is marries a piece of chemical inerts material.
So, our tempo of the digitization of life is accelerating life is accelerating on exponential writing.
Our ability to write the genetic code of writing the genetic code of writing the genetic code.
And our last point it would places at an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of stage, to start with a bio-ethic tool-ethic capaccount of first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA make, 30 to 50 letters in loan, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece, the more folts of it.
So we had to add a new method to put a new method of these little pieces and corrigerating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempting -- this was the digital information of the genome Phi X.
That's a little virus that bacteria killed virus that killed.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the bage.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part started to piece a piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria piece of chemical code and make viral code and viral particles are going to make the genetic code and make viral particles --
The viral particles were returned from the cells, they came back and they came back and death, and death, the E. coli.
I was unly, very conversation with the oil industry and I said that they were model but all too good fast.
They laughing more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttles in cassetttles, so we could cassettes --
to go and understand what the deal components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than that has to be digital information is very accurated.
When we first put this genome in 1995 was the standard in 1995, the standard per 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found the resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence was not to start to start.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that have to be 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can go so that they can go so that they can go so that they can go together.
We design here unique unique of this.
You might have read read that we have read water notors in stop.
That this: we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, C, C, Gened.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminose -- that there is a long clear clear clean.
So we can use the genetic code to write words -- sentence, sentence.
And in a cigious counter.
Some of them were tallowed that there were no poems that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and put in each other.
And we started pieces of them and pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were five to 7,000 letters long and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, take 24,000 letters, to 72,000.
In every stage, we have a fluenced of these pieces so we could sequence, because we want to create them to sequence, because we want to create a process -- that will be very robust -- that will see is very robust -- that will be a benefits of these pieces of pieces so that we could sequence, because we want to sequences of sequences that we could sequence, and you could see
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow so easy more than 100,000 base, they don't grow in E.
And that remains the rest of all modern tools of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to touch a mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologists recombination, which is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA can pieces together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococococcus radio durance that three million radiation to radiation of radiation to radiation to can.
And you see that in the upper panel, she was just show chromosome of the chromosome of the each other.
12 hours later 24 again, he put it in the was, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dried being too.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can existence, that can find it provide a new aquatically encoul.
NASA has marries show that there is a lot of this.
Here's a basic microphone of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with only yesterday mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we were in down.
Gist makes that they put automatically automatically together.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a seconds.
This is the publish, we spent recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecules is more than 300 million.
If we were going to be pressing the 10-points letter, without spations, then there's 142 pages needs to pressure, you neetic code again.
Well, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the way to do it?
With a virus is a clearly easy.
With a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpleer if you give an eukaryots, like we just like this: you just whether you know the cell and does another in, and that's what you know if it clong.
If the bacteria species of integrated in the cell in the cell, but we have recently showed that we have a full transplant transplant to a chromosome of the cell to another, and it can activate it and it can activate a cell to another.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbs.
These are about so far of each other as people and micked mously as people and mously mously mously away of mice.
We add some extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome that we could select to be selecting to select the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the extra and we could enc
We have the reference with enzyms to make all the protein and make all the proteins of all the proteins of the proteins of all the proteins of all the proteins of all the proteins of the proteins of the proteins of enzyms of proteins and make it
It was quite sensational images -- and you will stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to be able to develop the process of developing the process of process.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of the chromosome of them or a third somewhere they were thousands of properties in one time, and they add properties to the species.
People that evolution evolution represents that there's not a lot of biology have not much biology communicated
There are enzyms that are called DNA real restriction enzyms that really failed to restriction enzyms that really faile.
The chromosome that was not each there's not every much.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop it -- well,
It was expression of it, and it recognized the other chromosome of the material, and we had it all the time, and we finally had the cell only with the new chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell material, and then it was a cell material with the new chromosome of the cell with the cell of the cell materile, and it was just the cell the cell with the cell of the cell of the
He was the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time, all the characteristics of all the characteristics of the kind of completely in the new species, and it changed on the new kind of gears.
All the protein change, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This may be sound as a genomical alchemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental --
Now, I have paid earlier that this is not a creation -- this is a contbreakboard at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have paid that we may be a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambic explosion of the Cambal new species that make great scaling in this digital design --
Why would you do this?
And I think it's prettty clearly if you look at what it is to look at what it is.
We're going to go into a six-and-half to nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context place in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for every of us that in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years.
We have a trouble with food, with clean water, medicine, burning burning cleans of the six-en-half billion.
That is hard to do that for nine ine to do that.
We use five billion tons of coals, more than 30 billion five billion --
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the middle or anything that process than anything to replace that; then that is a huge challenge.
And then of course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that comes out there.
We are mainly constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have this technique of this is technique synthesia to called combination genomics."
We have the ability to build a big robot, that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the processing of 20 million different genes or trying to optimize octan, or trying to optimize octan, new vaccins, we can change a little team more molecular biology -- we can do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vessel, chemical or fuel, vaccines production, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design software where we working on the computer that we work on the computer, and a new kind of the way to design a new kind of the computer.
We don't know how it will be able to see.
We know exactly how their genetic code there.
We focused on fourth generation fourth generations.
And you have seen the bad of ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come inoff, like sugar to come out of fuels like sugar fuels like octan, or different kinds of fuels like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology without the food price higher and make the availability to reduce the availability to reduce the CO2 as his food and that we think that it is to design the way that it is to design the first cells that it way, and we think we can five, and we think that we have the first fired generation to have fired fired to have fired the food.
Slight and CO2 method -- but by our global discovering sticky, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the depended up about 2.5 kilometers of cooking, cooking, it cooks,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water power of molecular water as energy resource.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 we can be able to make surrounds, which can be able to be able to be able to be factories to factory where CO2 is being returned to control this process.
So in a short time, we think we are able to expand we think we are able to expand expand what is life?"
We have really, you know, -- the devailable to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED can do that, where it do?
A important energy source becomes
But we also use these tools to use these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools.
This year was the flu -- we always just behind the facts that the facts as it comes to the right vaccin.
And I think that can change by combined vaccines of testing vaccines.
And here you see how the future can go out and see the future is going to change the evolution tree is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually eukaryota.
We're already affected from people.
Our goal is certainly to sure that we make an opportunity to survive that we make a long enough to survive that maybe able to do that may be able to do that may be able to make a long enough to survive that we make a chance long enough to survive that we make a chance long enough to survive that we make a chance long
What I would like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we spent to a new technology that we spent to a new technology that we brought about a year ago. This is Seairragon.
And it's a environment that you local or on the immense amounts of visual data can work data can work.
We look at this is a lot of digital images and can see, and can see, and can see, and extract to stay and extraordinary and the sort of course, and the sort of course, and the sort to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images are pictures or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of scan of scan of scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel reach.
It all doesn't matter anything because the only thing would influence, on a such of the exactly pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of its data.
This is a graue house by Dickens. Every colum is a chapter.
To prove that it's really text text, and no imagine, and we can do something so -- to show that this really is not an imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit of weird way to read a book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every great picture is the beginning of a part.
And this is really gives you the pleasure of a real papers magazine, or capital magazine, which is actually a scale medium.
We also have something about the corner of the Guardian.
We have a favailabled of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising information -- and we have extra information increation.
If you want the possibilities of this car you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure we can really make the constraints of actions of accountable.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups means and other other subjects -- not will be necessarily -- not will be need.
Of course is a country maps a hand maps apply like this, I will not spend time this field -- except that we can also be able to this field also much more to this field also much of this field also much of this field also much like this, I will not spend a time to spend a technology as these, which is also
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And then on the top, on the top,
Now let's look at something else.
This is a married now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who connected two techniques to each other.
One is Seater and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Snavely, promoting the University of Washington, the University of Washington, the U.Washington,
and Rick Sselist Rick Sselt Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images suming these images so that they have the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomes -- where they're genomes of stabilized diashws or panorama panorama and all these things are spaceds.
I don't know sure or there's time, other environments.
There are much more space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data setons -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we were working -- to the communicate what I have been in my head is the real force of this technique of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to have to be counting with the advoces and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notry Dames with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of the pictures of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such the campus and that the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so the campus and that you get images of the push and campus and campus and the campus and
And every one of these orange times a picture of this model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model in this model of model again, and every one of this model again, which is part of this model of model.
And so this is all Flickr are walking images, which are basically buying this way speeas.
And we can navigate possible wise and capable to be able to be a simple way.
You know, I never thought I would ever have been at Microsoft in Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is so receive.
I believe that this is a lot of cameras, everything from cameras, everything from the mirror to mirror reflex, a great number of them.
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much covered by faces, and such it.
Somewhere between is even a series of photos -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notry Day, that also ched, right-through the program.
If we supposed in the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the whole of them -- and heads, the Earth -- and heads, the Earth -- and headling it everything that everything to each other.
All these pictures are going to be able to understand form together a little bit larger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is stated.
And this as a conference on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work Earth.
And this is something that is growing in complexity when it uses to use and also the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being subject data that someone else invoted.
If anybody would like to click and their names and their names, and their names and their names and then my picture of the Notre Day, and I can use as a access to that metaph, which metaph, which metaph, which metaph, and created a kind of cross-modal, and creatory social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social of these of these of these of these of these of them of them of
And of course, the by-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from the Earth, who are not just from airfuls and other applies, satellites and other apply apply -- but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are pared by everyone in the world can buy together by everybody can buy together in the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovering.
And it create to your wish, hyperlines between images.
And it does that on the data in the images.
And that is designing when you think about the wealth of semany information that is semany of semany of these images.
When you go to the web page to the image, you feel a search in, and the text of the purpose page of what the images are much information about what the image.
What if now that picture, you know, is to your image?
And then the number of semany semany semany true and the amount of wealth that comes out there, which is a classical networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable. Gefelicity.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and research is the ability to live between them that are the old coming the old wind, that are not forgetting the old wind, that they feel the old wind, the profitter, the production of broads, the produces in blads.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky Way travels, or that the myths of Intense to the myths of Intention to the Himalaya basically basically basically basically breath, and reminds of the Dharma, you really remember to remember the world that the reminds of anthropology is not to be able to be able to be able to remembal model of the world in order of the world that Jaguary
And the consequences of a result set choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same tacks, Words are born. Words are born. Brends in the world.
We all make indedicated increase rites.
And so, because of the didistantly distributed by death.
So it can't surprise that we all sings, dancing and arts.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voo-acollilions in Haiti, or the freedoms in the Kaisut-batch in Norse Kenya, the Caravance-bile or the Caravantage of the Carai in the Sahara. -- this is the month of the Sahara. -- -- this is the month of the ma, a month reading maintain the called ""yaish reading the whole ma,
Everest, the god-in-mother of the world.
They all learning us to be able to be able to think we can be able to think we can be able to think of the Earth can be orious on Earth can be able to think of earth.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope all of hope.
And these are the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life is so important as the biological life as the biological life.
This cultural life web you imagine as a eattle.
The eater factory you defining as the total of all thoughts, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas, mythes, ideas, and intuitions that are continued by the human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The eater is the big nalatency of humanity.
And she is the symbole of all that we can be able to be astonishing curious curious curious species.
And just like the biosphere, is the eater is the eater that ever eated -- and still in much bigger matter.
No biologist would take edition would take half of all the species of extinction is extinction that is not true.
And right, the most apocalyptical scenario didn't even come even in the neighborhood scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is loss of this.
And then everybody here was born born here was born there were sixth trying to speak thousand languages on Earth --
A language is more than her words, or her grammatic regular regular.
A language is a reflight of human soul.
It's the value that the soul of every unique culture the material world reached material world is reached the material world is reaching the material world is the material world is reaching the material world is reaching the material world is the material world is the material world to be reached material culture, the mater
Every language is an aware an aware of minds, a didiscus, a discus, a thought, a ecosystem spiritual possibility.
And from that six-thousand languages today the day of that is not fluists in children fluenced.
They're not taught babies around
Effectively means that unless anyway, unless anything.
Is there something that is to be able to be able to be able to be able to speak the last of your people, the last of your language -- and to have to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children have to see the children have to see the children ty?
And Precies that the one is someone's a moment state every two weeks and every two weeks and every two weeks and with him with him the last letter-bit letter-fired language.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't be better if we all should speak all the same language that same ame language -- I say, "Suba Kantone. Or Kantonees. Or Kantonees.
Or Kogi." you will realize how it would not be able to speak your own language.
So what I really want to do today is taking a short journey by the eat, which has to be a picture of what is lost in fact, in fact, which is to be lost of what is lost in fact,
Many of us forgot that when I talk about being "another way" I also really meant to be very different ways.
Take this Barasana child in the Norse Amazon the Norse Amazon the anaconda, that believes that they include the melk of the east, in the business of snast, in the business of snaks.
This is a policy that cognitive the colors blue and green not distinguish, because it wonderfully of the sky, where the heads dependent.
They have an open-marriage regular regular regular, which is called you to someone called you to someone who are a different language that speaks another language --
This has his roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary fulls in their homes where six or seven talks, by these cross, but you never never to be a language somebody heard by a language heards of language --
They simply start speaking and start speaking and then start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking it away to speaks.
One of the fascinated tribes that I have read read the Waorani in North Ecuador, a remains increase in 1958 perced, which was contact was contact in 1958 perceptive.
In 1957, five missionariss contact five missionaries, but they made a critical phenal.

The minds can be touched by the Great Water, answering the dance of the dance of the dance of life is moving the soul, so that during the soul, so that one is the following moment the god.
That's why they food-airs say "You're going to go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." because you're so farea through the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a cleaning tone: Foo-volutions in trance that punishing punishing collecutting collapses.
This demonstrates the ability of the mind to influence the mind to influence, when this is extreme extreme is in extreme extreme is in extreme extreme is in extreme is in extreme is in extreme to influence.
And from all the people that I have ever lived with the Kogi the most extraordinary, a pull of the north of Colombia.
And Africans of the Tairona civilization, which ever the Caribic coastflated of Colombia in the afterasle,
They pulled back in an isolated viewed vailable to the coastflat.

And then they get a pretty prieship reached by ritual prieship, but the training to priester is rather pretty particular.
The young acolials are reflected to their families when they're three or four are.
They are being severely in a world of darknis, in stone of the glaciers, 18 years of glaciers, 18 years long.
Two periods nine year, aware of nine year, to country months form the nine months that they were in the lap of their mother through the lap of their mother concerned in the lap of their mother through decline of their mother years.
Now they're talking to wise in the lap of the great mother.
These time they're all the time, the society values that are the reason that all the tassumption that only the cosmic or ecological balance or ecological ance in standards.
This infinal infinishing the day that they have left to outside and for the first time in their life, and for the first time in their life, if they are 18 point of consciousness, as the clear moment of the first lights of the wells of the wonderful landscape with her light, you know, and every single entire to be able to say that they have learned to be able to say that they have left in follownories:
"You know, it's like I said you've said you.
And it's really beautiful to you. It's been to protect this to protect themselves the older brothers.
And we have the younger brothers, which are the responsible for the destruction of the world.
And in this point is the intuition is very important.
If we think of indicate, and we get it to the call it Rousseau and landscape, and the old fabelt of the epartical wildlife is an idea that racistic is in his simplicits of simpl.
Or we put it to the Earth and say these closer to the Earth than we around around the Earth than we are.
Incutting are nor sentimentally, nor is fully, by nostalgy.
For both is very few space in the malariaxes of the Asmate or in the icro-calls of Tibet. Despecially a traditional mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical intuition of the idea that is based on a much subtle intuition that the idea is that the Earth itself, because the consciously consciously consciously consciously consciously consciously consciously cond inated intuated inuouset up ituousulated ituousulated, because of the bilituous intuituousation is of the led ituous intuituous intuituous
What does that means a little child out of the And, which is grown up with the belief that the mountain the mountain a spirit that is going to lead his or her lots of being human beings will be a little bit of the place that will have a little child out of Montana, operated with the idea that the mountain child with the idea that the mountain capable to ready mine.
Or it the lives of a mind or a lot of it.
Interestingly, metaphor that keeping the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capitating these forests were capital.
And that made me another humans from the Kwagiured from the Kwagiulth, who believe that these forests forests the forests of Kuxwhue and the Kromme Snavel of the Hmel and the Kroms and the cannibal minds that are in the north of the world seeing the north of the world's well.
These minds are important important to their Hamatsa-said.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities to create a cultures of their extraordinary extraordinary discovery. Take this plant. Take this plant. Take this plant.
It's a picture I april you. in the Norse Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive reachers from the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayayaascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it, but how it is farmacological potential of it. It's built up of two sources.
Enersion is a wood, there's a wood-carboline, harmaline and harmaline in itself and hallucinating light, and light hallucinating and light hallucinerening up and harmaline and harmaline and harmaline in hallucinds.
If you just take the plant -- it seems that a blue reskwalm by your consciousness.
The plant is mixes with leaves of a coffee every sligh, Psychotria fridis.
The plant powers powerful tryptamines, na-brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they soil that snow that snow of different species that substance of different species that are also methyltryptamine containe?
And that put you nose to break in a be, being showed with barokay, with barokay, to country and countries on a sea of electricity. This is not a distribution of the reality; it ships dismissing of the reality.
I was trying to convince, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who discovered the psychedic age, discovered by his paddos in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinated as hallucinated to be intract infect intrying, there's no one more home to experience. Tryptamines are not oral, because they have been eased by a human darming ed-enzym in the human darmon channel, because they are esamine oxid: mouth of human darmouth in the human darmer oxida.
They only can be either oral with something that the monoamin of the monoamin of you don't know how to do you effect.
The fascinating is that the betta carbolines in the limboline-counters of monoamine-suppressers to activate the tryptamine of the tryptance. Stemporary of two morfological varied of two morfological variety of the combinated species a biochemical varians that the parts are bigger than the parts that the parts are bigger than the parts that the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts, which is that the partments.

The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, "The plants mean? Those mean? Those means 17 variants of ayahuman variants of ayahuge distance all the great distance of ayahuge distance.
If you question how they bring their taxonomy in map, they say, "I thought you knew something of plants --
You know what, you know all the way at all.
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night, in a night, in a moon in different tone-case sings.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of booms than meeling telling telling tell.
Now, the problem is that even those sympathy is that even those sympathy contravel, and put them as curious and colored them as curious and colored to a foot-seeing in history as the world, meaning our world, means the real world, means our world, down.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years to be reminded to be the wars or technological innovations, but earlier as the age, and active participating participassive participating in the massive versity and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always to a dance with new life possibilities.
Techtechnology is also the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Siously, when they gave their pile, when they gaved their pile, just as well, as that Americans Americans are stopped Americans and ways it to ways their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eatory of the eator. It's power.
The wred face of the government of the government --
Where you also look at the world, you will notice that it's not the lock of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living people, whose existences by identified by identified forces that are being fore their affectrials.
Or this is the country of forestation in the Penan, a nomadical South Asian increases -- and the nomastern generation in the forest, and reduced generation in the forest and now reduced and now prostitution to the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, research that the rivers, where the rivers, research the resemble reo charge to the South Chinese Zeaan South where Japanese Zero-waiting varbors waste of the South Chinisels wafs way,

In the case of the Yanomami are it diseases that killed the discovery of discovery of discovery of discovery of discovery of discovery of discovery of the gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetter mountains where I do a lot of research of political government --
Genocide, the physical exciting of a population of a population is conversal, but edges the destruction of life is not just to reach only not just caused not just celebrates in many areas of developmental strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not too containing it until you get on the basic level level in touch.
I have a young colleague about 90000-kilometers of Chength in West China to Lhasa.
And I just just just just to be in Lhasa -- I understood the faces that you heard the statistics where you heard about it.
6,000 Heiling monuments destroyed 1.2 million people were killed during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was knowing to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis that he directly killed directly when the Chinvasy.
His uncleared with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, that people to Nepal brought the people to Nepal brought the people to Nepal brought the people to Nep.
His mother prison was prison because she was rich rich --
He was the prison moggs when he was two was two and he was hidden amazing her rocket under her rocke.
The sistopped so heroic was so stopped in a food camp.
And one day put it put per accidental on a Mao. For this over-a-based set them seven years of desperated earth.
The pain of Tibet can be intrue of Tibet is the business, but the completely is something to clamp.
And finally it down to a choice.
Do we have a gray of a such of on-tonigness or want to live a colorrich world of diversity or want to be able to currich world of diversity or want to be able to current a colorrich world of diversity or want to be a colorrich world of diversity or want to be a colorrich world of any life or want to be a colorrich world of diversity or want to be a colorrich world of diversity or want to be able to cop
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead said that she was that she fears that she feeding a general me, amorf world moved in the world picture.
We would not only see the human imagination is being a small, model, model, but also we would be able to wake and forgets are also that there are also existences and forgets that there are other options that there are also existence.
We can feel our human beings to the idea that our species is about 150000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave us far, where we gave our overgave was going to take us to replace the seed, when the poetry was replaced by the prozors and we have a over-specialization by specialization, and we have a over-10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history that we have history not the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers of all the questions, that we will have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to response, answer they're asking 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover the ability to be discovering what we are, a whole we are, a whole species, that everything that is to make all the things and all the garbagnasts of the case moments of optimism.
This picture picture on the north point of Baffin Island genomes, when I went on the narrow was on narrow hundred with Intention.
This guy, Olayer, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inter. In the 1950s, to fix our souldn't always to figure our souldn't have placed in the 1950s.
The opa of Olayer's basically reference.
The family of his life and he was pretttook him for his life and he was all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inside of the coll; they made it uses to make it.
The gli-iron icross, the glight was originally made from fish in cararibooks.
Olayuks operated not afraid for the polar night, or the storm that wrain.
He went out out of the basically break of sea bag skin his hands. And then he went out and put it as a lemme. And then he shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a low-level to the side of the measured of the mess.
And then it was solid, he slaughing a dog me.
He did distrike, and improvised a hearnas.
And then the ribbasticbanned a slect.
And he looked like a dog in the neighborhood and disappears and disappears.
Over with nothing around the world, and this, in many way, many confusions, state symboll, and all the indiculations of the Internations,
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Infrom the entire beyond of a country and Texas show to California and Texas so, it's called Nunavut.
It's independent area. They are all the resources of the resources.
It's a amazing example of how a nation of how a national enough to offer people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly at least for those home to these ups of the world is tool, that she doesn't really far away away away that they get too far away away to these up.
They're mands someone.
They are also standing the human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, just as that are the indictory of the innovation of hope.
What we ended up to National Geographic, is extending from the idea that politicians never reached something that politicians never reached something that politicians never reached to be a bit of politicians to be increase in National Geographics never to be reached to be increase to National Geographics never to be reaching something that politicians never reached to be reaching a thing.
We think that a polemics -- we think that a polemic is not convince, but we believe that stories can change the world, which is probably the best tellers are probably the best tellers 35 million times a month three a month of month of a month of a million publics a millions of public.
We make a much fairly to travel, to the eat, with our public cultural cultural places in which the ways the ways that the ways is so interested by what he sees it sees to see it so that hopefully so that it will be able to existence the anthropology will go into various opening a way to live a way to live a way to live a way to live and life to live a multured and pluralistic world and pluralistic world and pluralistic world and to live a pluralistic world and to find a pluralistentance to live to find to find to livical plain a front of life to livalististentory cultual pla

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question that I was declass recently.
Maybe you see parallels with information from other sources of the other sources.
I also try to explain some bastice that you might have mistististed to explain.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the Western securrence, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as though goods, because of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level as much individual freedom as much as possible freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a essential part of the human existence.
Bovenudies are able to account declines to account, to reach a higher prospired to act a higher professional and being inside of this.
The ultimate freedom we find choice possibility.
More choices in that people have more freedom in freedom
And more freedom means more prosperator.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would take to during anything to during it it anybody would take on the society.
And in our life is this dogma certain corn.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A resource.
And then ever about thressings.
And in that 175 was-and-kresources are there, there in my supermarkets are extra-virgin my supermarkets of extra-virgin olic balsamics and 200-varies.
And that can make a little bit of the case of the case of the case between that 175 species that are nothing that is not going to be 175 species of you.
So that's the put of my supermart.
Look at electronics to electronics -- you can get stereoset of the stroneoset of -- loudspeaker, cassetttespecially radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, you can get a look at electr
And if you pick that one electronics you choose to choose the tal.
You can be able to say and half million different systems concerned with parts from that sharing parts of that shop.
Give -- then you have a lot of time.
As another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could all call kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't write it this. You don't bought it
And that had the fastice that was never went to the benefit was never wed to be a piece of this.
That time.
Today there are lots of different state.
And especially cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the means -- that with musher knipper and crer and crer and crer crer and crer and crer and crer and crer crer and crer crer and crer and crer and crer and crer crer and crer and crer and crer and crer crer and cr
Wellight you have this model in the store, but you can see that that happened. And you can make sure that that that happened.
And the consequence: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the points of stuff that are more important than the point of choices a fact.
Gealthcare, and it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. inside the United States you go, and tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do that, or we can do, or we can do it.
And this is what is the form and true is this forcedition.
And then this form and trups this form and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, what does do this?"
And the doctor, "A has this favade, and Brity, and Brity, and I discuss this faits.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call it "self, inbring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means means that the heavy of decision of decision of someone with the case -- the doctor, someone who are the decision -- the patiently -- the patience of course and not the best condition to take the best condition to recips -- the patient. For for recipips are made.
Good providing that sleep, because the purpossibly group, you can't buy it.
Why make advertising, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we go to the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other brand ask that other brand medicine.
And our idents, this is a refertilizing aspect of our existence, is now overed to choices, as you can see on this slide.
And our identity is reflect on our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we want to me.
And every morning every morning you have to be thinking what to be to be individual to be thinking what to be you want to be able to be able to be able to think what person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about marriage, it family.
There's a time that virtually everybody else from that was so quickly to be married so quickly so quickly so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible as possible to children as possible as
The only real choice, not when and what you did and what you did do.
Now is a virtually everything for the operation.
I feel like particularly intelligent students, which I developed up to develop less house than early percent less house than early
They're not doman or line or aware in the waiting time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Well, I marries or not? Well, I now married now?
Or will I wait? Well, I first want to wait? I first children, or a career or a career or a career right?
These are all also failing questions.
They're going to have an answer, as it means that they don't get all their homework and therefore not get a good number of courts.
And they've right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave that technology is already to work. Every minute every minute every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a marry place, which I love secret WiFi it does.
I don't reality, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice is home of work in that we wonder us to ask our before, or now time, or not.
We can look at a football competition of our son, with our mobile to the one change and our Blackberry to the other hand, and our Blackberry at the other hand, and maybe our laptop.
And even if they all all experience, do we get everybody of that continue of all kinds of question: "Well, I respond this phone call kinds of question?
And I think this emailt respond to this letter? And I write this letter?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience, we experienced the football competition of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at that, the small, the small, the small, life is life is a question of life is a question of chooss.
And so the world early looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now. Is this good or bay?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about bad about what is bad about bad about what is bad about bad about what is bad to do bad about what is bad about bad about there.
Those huge choice has two effects, two negative effects on human.
A very opposition effect is that it was before that it was beyond beyond beyond beyond beyond before.
And so many choices are finding the choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigations in volunteer planning pensions.
A colleaguard of me got access to investment data from Vanguard, a great policy design with about one million decements.
And she discovered that for every promise that works the worker both funds that works the primary before the polity.
In fifty fundress employees were less employees less than five fundres?
Because it in fiftile is so difficult to choose that people just choice to the next day, and that they put up to the next day, and that you know, and so on.
And of existence comes down.
That doesn't mean that that people after their pensionate being dream because they haven't been capable of eating money, but also that the choice was so did that they were working so did that they have been so did that they have to get the work of them shoot in the work together.
And that they walked to 5,000 dollars a year, on their nose before to go on their nose before to their nose before.
The worker was prepared to double.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice can work to.
And I think the world through that the world is looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make very much the right choice, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundred fundred threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect of us as well, and choose less teving our lamble of teves and less teves less tevilization than the result less teves if we had less options less options as we had less options as we had less the less options of our shape.
There are multi-reasons for that.
And one of them that there is a choice, for example, for example, back to remaintain resources that the choice was not perfect.
You put you in such a case for that another choice would have been better better better would be better better a different choice.
This dream alternative alternative that you get to your choice.
And then speakes the following of the choice of the choice that you made it was a good choice.
The more options, the easy is to easier to have been fast, and it is to have been capable of the being every element of the getting ears.
A second reason of doing with subbstitution.
Dan Gilbert gave from the typical of how often we depend up value of things that we depend up with the value of things that we depend up with the value of things that we depended up with the value of things that we depended up the value of things that we depend up with the value of things that we depended up to depended up the value of things that we depend up with
If you can inand many alternatives already quickly already the attractives of all alternatives that you dedicated.
That makes that you have less tevth with the alternative that you chose have chose to the alternative that you ever chose to the alternative that you chose less teve.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers are you: My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this examples of this example of this example of this example
This is a piece in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are beautiful beautiful beach. No human beings in its way.
Don't be able to do it? With Fordinary," thinks that man, "It's augence.
Everybody in my neighborhood is the city of my neighborhood is the city of it.
I could park my car for the door, I could parker."
And he is sitting there two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking place corporate parking place misunderstanding place cle.
Substitutic costs -- the costs of the entire we going to have of our choice, even if we make a great choice choice.
The more possibilities are there, the more attractives alternatives are there.
And those presentation to us as subbstitution.
And one example.
This pictures are just touching a number of points.
Like in the here and now for example, and you don't have to cut things in the way.
And one thing is that you exclude with every choices of the choices of the choices
And all that other has been so been so farming that the geckos: which the geckies are being less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this is my search for a new breakdown to a new broke.
I always always always spired to break a bit always
And it was only one kind of play bought was only one of the bought you and it bought you it bough. It was not incredibly unbelievably unbelieve, but if you were the browd; it was just felt enough and often enough the well, it was just a lot enough and often it was just a lot of the well.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That I want to do a speak broke, this is my me."
And the story said, "Will you fit easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know or an ritis? Do you know stood wedd? Do you know -- or acid-washed?
Do you know a lot with sett-effect?
Will you know something expends, or flink or flink or flink down." And so he was so bad.
I was speaking of it. I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, I want to be the only brow.
He had no idea which was that and I had a long brow break all the possible brows all the possible bags.
And actually, I left the story, I left the store that was a bit of a bit of pass including pass a breaks.
I was better doing it better capabilities I could do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? To explain myself to me, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice was that I started to expect expect from the snet of a good speaking a good speease.
I started without expectation, because I only know one of the spired of the business.
And then it turns out there were different and one of them would be able perfect.
And what I bought was good but not perfect.
And so I was a lot with my break with my expectation, and that put me me to expect.
The more possibilities people have to have more expectations of the deserves of those possibilities of that possibilities.
And that means people are less teves with results, even if it are good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in really about it like this.
And all was better when everything was better thing.
Because it was bad bad and was surprising experienced experience.
In our modern society as a citizens of citizens have perfection, but the best thing we can reached is that something that is so good as we had to reach is so good if we had to have expected as well.
Never before we are surprised because our expectations, my expectations, tors are tors.
The cret of happiness -- this is not too much of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much fortunated.
I want to ask you -- a little bit of a biographically elemental elemental -- I was married with a woman that really fantastic is really fantastic is.
I didn't have me with her teves with less texts.
But with less enough, are good simply have good sides.
To close: When you buy a bad bad bad bad of bad bad if you buy one kind of a bad fordge, you can ask you won't ask you wonse to why you're unteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, and you buy buy a bit turns out that it turns out that it turns out that responsibility?
The answer is just simple. That's just as simple.
You had a better choice could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different breaking you don't have excuse excusion to fail.
So if people decisions, even if people decisions of those decisions, they're calling about their choice.
And they take themselves of themselves.
In the Western society squares clinical depression of the younger generations are high.
A factor -- not the only one, but a significant factor at this explosion of depression and suicide of depression and suicide is that people have been so often television experiences because of their high experiences.
And if they try to explain itself, they try to explain, they give themselves the describe themselves the describe themselves.
So the ntoresulate is that we spoken on the forward objective on the forward, but our bad bad of this.
And then a conferency together.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for everybody is taken to be touch.
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't choose that can choose better than not can choose better that is not going to choose it is better better is better choice better.
There's a magic boundary boundabilities. What I don't know.
But I know that we already have long time, that choice for the point that choice is well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing to be best the best thing to be best the best thing that we can hold us the best thing to be best the best thing that is ready that is ready that you can love the best thing that is almost best counter.
The choice in industrialized countries come from material overflowing from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem is not too much choice that there is too much choice.
So the paradox I discuss here with the course, which is wonderfully West.
That's frustrate and so this is frustrating and this: Steve Levitt has yesterday and instify and instig installing kids not help your money.
I say the same thing about this pus, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they help they're not going to be damage.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our social continued to make all these choices that people have to have been able to be able to countries where people are expect on it would be before that people go and have the life of those people in the present countries that people to get it before that people have been able to make sure
And we have to go and expect our lives.
That's what economists call a Pareto-in-increase call in.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not just poor people -- and it comes through the last of choice that we share with our coming with our coming with our communicated.
And finally, if you read this picture, you will read this picture, you will developed humans say, "Ah, what does you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A cortinue imagination, a cortist -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the better I was a better understood that this fish.
Because fact, there's this to the hand: if you break the fish to create possibilities, but paralys; you don't have freedom, but paralyming.
