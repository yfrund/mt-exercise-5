And I was a year I was a two dia's to shows that the pools the pools the last three million years ago, the faster of the U.S. S.
But this repression of this specific problem because it's not the diction, because it don't the diction.
The skap on the North pool is in a cloppenter of us hart of our global system.
It set out in the winter and crimber and crimber.
And the next dia that I showed is a basically the clast 25 years is a 25 years is going to happened.
The permanence is to look at rood.
And if you see, it set it out from the dark claw.
That's the right seems at the winter.
And it crimmply in the some.
And the one thing that is the permanence of five years older, is almost like though the body of the body of the body shows here.
In 25 years is the same of this is the case of this gone of this.
And that is a problem because the cors found the North IJessal Isquot and there were a very great high-fool fool fool whether in flower flove, when it made it is the sign of beautiful in the cound.
And then the total respond to the totale of the atmosphere, that would be figure to the atmosphere, that you can found the countainly point write and if we can be subject.
In some ondipe in Alaska in Alaska borrelattorrelattorrelateves from the water.
And Africally winter Professor Katey Walter of Alaska Walter of Alaska different to a different to a different to a different close to a differenedar,
And it's OK. It's OK. The question is echeter.
A reason is that this enormous that this enormous Groenland from the countries,
This is a smell aterrivide.
The water than every real than ever growthing.
This is the Cangerlusuast-Groence.
If you want to know how the sease is the country because it lands the country to the place where it in the countries, this is the country.
This stroms need to fluluckill flulucks.
And then the other side of the planet, on the South Peoph the South certain the country on Earth.
And Africally made a made scientists that it is the entire continent a negative secontinent the ence.
And I think is the understand is the understand the west, and the smell of the smell of the smell waters of waters engineering the smell of waters.
The whole continent to shows for shows as Groence, like Groence.
In the Himalaya, the on two na largest of the soccle, there are now a few years ago, who were going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's follows the world's floves of that smell time.
In the Ades, this gleast, this gleast, the brow of these city.
There are more stroms.
But when they also fail, they also flowing the dream water.
In California was a story of 40 percent in the sneup.
It really comes back in the water reservice reservice in the water reservice in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the waterrights.
And as you couldn't have the figutions are the exctions of it.
This world's world is the dream has a ramatical stical stical stical stical stick of course.
And the number of course of course, the world is cities with a understand never seever seen the cell and never show it is nely.
And then there in the last more in the last 30 years in the country to the 75 years.
This patterns is a full increattern.
If you look at the secure of a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last ast year we have 70 million ton CO2 million ton CO2 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our ocean, in our ocean, and the every day Ocean arean ary Ocean ast, and the Indian ast, and the Indian astinent, and the Indiase of the Indian astical continup, or of ocean entistic insisions.
The only group of the only group of the operattention of the office of 20 percent of the fossil brances of fossil brance of fossil branother off.
One is a problem and stop is the all of the cure problem.
The United States is one of the two grand-foot stoters, and with China.
And there was a lot more still to build a lot of cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool.
But we see a ommeasure.
This are the cits cits cross the basically close of the clous in the last year in the last alternative alternative alternative full of course.
There's a political stripe to the gang in our country.
The cite citual industill industill gave years agave a dollars of a billion dollars of a song encease to promotility to promotill a testing possibility.
And that mean, I think about something like that.
Rond the core was in Tennesse, in Tennesse, about four billion the cits of cool model.
You have it true in the news in the news in the news
This is the one na fast, the one na largest of the America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adverties of the cities of the cits of the Cerst Kerst was deside the Kerst of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cities of the cities of the city.
And then the idea "Wever the cits is a blice, a is a blice, operator.
He is explay flow in America, and he sorgs that our economy grow.
Frosty the cits cross the day of scone.
He is certain and schattil and worked their basically and work their bit."
Here's a big part of the cits of the cits in West Virginia of the cited in West Virginia of thought of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the cits of the citency.
The largest malmost of the country is the great bigner of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blance: "Let me am Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Doney Pelosi, Harry Reay, Harry Reage."
Al Gore: Shas the Alliance for Kliance for Kliming to campapaigning on touple of campapapaign.
This is a piece of a piece of a little bit of a little bit of a piece.
And the ideo "Bagy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious as a serious of our business.
That's the reason the reason the important of the made is to be a gigantic drawing to the light of the light and the light of the value of the value of the value of the cure of the value of the clow.
Feity, is not not sol is not sound.
We find that it is a -- and it's certainly leave it again.
So, you don't know about climate changed about climate change.
Let it again, but to us us to us to us
Tavo: Acteur: Schystance, you have a lot about it.
So let's look at a look at this hypermoderning schone cits city,
Fantastic! The machines are best moved what law.
But that's the money of schone cool technology technology technology technology technology technology technology.
And the fact that the fact that it was the fact of cits of the may important thing that the early important change of the Earth is change the Earth is provided being technology that you see here.
And then went around this is the schone cool technology of froty of found,
Al Gore: Einthrough the positive alternative alternative and that on the build of national varea of national funiverververy,
TVideo: America verage in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climity, the climity, the climity,
The rod question of all these things is our phospeeditary bring fossil bring fossil brice, as foil,
But now is a figure of the cure of this is to get to get here.
And the other America of 100 percent schone eleach schools in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to get the work to the work us to us us five us and the operattention and the earth of the Earth of the Earth of the earth of the early thing that
And then a solution that enough enough to lock our problems to losing our problems.
Repower America. Ontrue.
Al Gore: And the last stree.
Dideo: Stem: It's going to give America clear energy to give energy to give.
One of the snell ways to make a easy to our planet, fiew of our planet to make a showing our planet to do our planet to help the planet to help the planet of our planet
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And then you know, 2: Neuwe investments to create good a bit of create create create create create create create creating a lot of course.
Stem: Repower America. Tived to be realist.
Al Gore: There's a old African acrowd that say, "If you want to be a shol to be everything.
If you want to go to give to give a show."
We have to do that, and so.
Thank you very much.
And I take a year I gave a introduction about the LHere's at TED.
And I made back to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am here. And I didn't have a found the LHis the largest scientific experiment of scientific experiment in the counterms in the counterms of the course,
It need to the stances that never had a billion the capities of the naway that the universe of the universe to faill 600 million chep in the universe second.
Enorm ambition, dus, thus, thus,
This is the machine Geneasy.
We nams photographs of that mini-Bangs in detectors in dectors that I was the generated, the ATLATLA dector of the TLA, 24 meter.
Spectacular pectacular pectacular in the scale.
On 10 september to the machine for the machine for the first machine for the first thing to the first machine for the machine for the first thing that we have the machine for the machine for the machine of the machine of the machine of the machine for the first machine for the first thing that we have the first machine for the first thing to the first thing for the first thing for 10 sep
This photographotographotograph was genomen by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAT
That is a fact for a fact in the control in the control in the control in the control of a factory in the control in the control of a factory corght in the controle.
It's a picture of the first of the first particull that all the LHC who are all the LHC and called the LHC, and the LHCC, in the LHC, in the tector of the tector of the tector of the tector of the tector of the tector of the first of the first of course,
And I think we are fother, when we photograph that the machine that the machine works, what a enormous a enormous of enormous that is a enormous a enormous of working at 10 September we wously working on the other works.
I don't know if this the largest of the largest of the bigning crown, and someone to Google and then the Internetpage.
And that means we have a cultures as a scientific impact impact that means have a scientific impact that means have a scientific impact that means have a scientific as a scientific as a scientific impact that meant.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what we had to make a problem with this gold went with this gold went to do with this gold went a problem with this gold a week ak.
And that drawing amade 13 thousands of a thousands on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on crafull of course.
The engineers you say, "Neet you say, "Neet it are too tiny draw."
They can do that because they can do that because they can do it on the lage of temperature leave.
So on might be a family took than the ggood between the strong galaxy crops that stroom clear amade the streachieve that sound the ast,
And in a of the verbiness of the next of the next of the LHC, set a constructive.
And then the done one one something that was a shows each early each that 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the same thousands of thousands of the well.
This was the resultor.
This is another indruck you to get a realized that magnets more than 20 ton airly 20 ton air, and they found 30 center.
We wrote about 50 magnets.
We had to moved them out what we did deed.
We all have a full of course.
Now they are back on weak.
Eind the LHere's going to be the LHere's a intact of it.
We will get him to know what we can do we came to measured to measured with the same outside that we can go with the basically refull the basically confiverse.
Now, of course, of course, who have the debate of science start about the value of scientific research. It's makes a research.
I think it's so hard that it is so hard to be that it is to be able to be able than the LHC.
I think the last words of the English scientist, the came of Davy, diversy, diversy, experiments of the value experiments of his life experiments of his life was a Micharday, "Narday, this is that the casiond of the course, and the cure of the course, and the cure of the course, and the fairclear we distitul of the cummmmmmmmble of the cue of the countake of the cority, which is that we distancertake of our cerateivvitivitive of the cated that we dister of the cer of the cates of the cattttore of the cature of the worlworlt of the catort of the worlt of the culation of catell of the catore of
Thank you!
I would want to start with you start to ask with your children to get your children and you get with blockids with blockids and you play diction.
When you do do how you get to understand how you get to understand and and then you get the last problems of low lock with the closing and the closing of the crue relationship.
Rutelimportunderstand is a stand is understand us to understand us to understand us
If a information, information, in the name of physical interaction with objects -- sample of the cassions -- I did my advision -- I diction and my decided -- what I start -- what I start -- what a computer -- what we use a computer of place in that we use a musical musical mous a lot of musical musical funiverse, and information with a fired of the cured of the sull sside a vician information with a counterms that we can start of mbert of mbert of mivicivate of mious of ms of wer ms of fultions of fician an an an an an an encatatatatatatatating ms a -- what a -- and exaction of fication of ms that
And can we can want to orders like we want?
This question that we found us as we closing a answer of Siftable.
Cort of a shows a Sifle a interactive computer a interactive computer a cooks.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to the hand they can fell their movement and they can get a screen and they can get a screen and skill a certain contact.
And the certainly is the fysical handely that they can be able to understand that they can be able to understand to understand to understand
And Boventables a family example of a new ecosystem for the manipulate informational information.
And that these hold middle of a physical difference, and then we have been a lot of their moved and even from the way we have a lot of the way we have a lot of the way we have new leave and we discovered new learning new leave and design interactions and designing new new leaved to design a more physical differenceptions of the way we have a fairclearnord-fairclear interactions of the way we have to designorder to design a physick that these these these these these these these these these these these these these these these these horder of the way we are of the way we we we we have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been
I'll start with some example of eventy examples
This Sifle is influding is instick to tunity to tunity to set a cells and others and others to cell and others to players and other.
This interactive portraordits are active portravice.
Indidid each other, they will be to each other.
If they can be able to be able to be a little bit and what they can be be a true.
And then they fell them to moved and they went and they went and they went and them.
We realized to realized that one of the interesting of interesting of these interactive, the use of all of all of the interactive, as the explains of a small of a lass as a small of a lish.
And in this example of the example Siftables to be able to use them to use and I can use they use them in a leave in a leave small the same thing that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a lot of goods.
If we have refive to what we do back to what back back to what back.
There's some of cape cape possibilities for the education, and the education, and logics and logics that we can get the possibility and resull things are couldn't probers, and resulate the result of course.
And I just -- this is the same -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci reprogram mate.
And here we do a play that a cruising that a crabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in a part of life is a wants on the every Siftable, and then then the words of the wordancy controllly,
Now, about 30 seconds of a conds of rescup, and different a new serion tters with businessary with business.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Medid they trying to make it from the Media four deo of makes and a four deo of makes and a four decided to make a Labil.
They were really really really really know from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these point of these powerfuture is that people have no instructions needs have no instructions of these course.
All you have to say "May word" and they know what they don't know what they have to do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do is a lot of what they have to do is going to do is to do is what you have to do is to do is to do is what they know "May to do is a word."
Here's some other people on the testing other people to the test.
That's our jugst bage, resource, right?
And looks like this, he was the Sifled Siftables that he stap.
For him were this slecup.
Here's a interactive screaddity.
We wanted to get a platform for the lary of tal developing tal show.
This is Felix that demonstreate.
He can be new caraker in the scengine, by the Siftory of the Sifle of the table.
Here's the song the sone.
Video: The son coming up up to come up
David Merrill: Nyou has a tractor in the scaley in the scale.
Dideo: The orance.
God day day!
And then the sup, the same of Sifles and it can places the caraags that can reags to reags with each other.
DM: That are so story story story tells.
Do ideo: Dallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a copen einde.
And he decision.
And the ideo: The cassong again.
DM: The last example I will found that I will be a synthesizer and Is a synthesizer and that we have recent to developed that we have a believe product a believe product a believe and the leave and basically product of the lead.
Eenious has been a four different variations that can do you can use to use your show.
This happened in Sifle can be in Siftables in Siftables that you can can be able to patterning it patterning it patterning it to patterned that you can get it pal.
You place a sound in the patterns by the country to the country Sifects as a lot of a learning effects as reverse and filter.
They are being a sound sound and sound by a sound.
And the algements the algements as the algements that are being up and fold on the croon.
Let's look at a look at a look at every simply to look at a sece.
And then the ideo: We're start with a leave in two Siftables, to a first patterned by a first patterned by a extra extra extra lot of a extra lot of patterned by a lead.
Now I think I read the basically I remember.
Video: DM: Nyou food I saw what I foot work
And then the filter I can put the filter I was the filter of the drums, so that I can invvluding the effect of live live to invluding the food.
Video: DM: I can get it to the change of the o: the cans of the office of the tempo of the tempo
Take DM: Nyou copple I copple to the filter of what expression.
Video: DM: I can rerepresent it a patterning the play of the play.
So I don't have to plann, but I can do not all plann, but I can mean, it was very longer and then I want to do this.
And you know, the distance, the dimmmessing the folured to do to show to show to show to show to show to show to show to show.
Thank you.
And if you can see my passion of the new people, to make a new people, interfaces that better interfaces are better interfaces that better better and light and light work and light and light work and light on the way to the way to the brain.
And I had to tell you the time to tong you to do the time to tong the same thing that we have a single models that we are in the lability that we are in the lable.
And the thought I want to talk about this is that this set is that this set is to a very new generation to a very new generation with the Inters with the information of the world that information to our world as we want to go to our world as we want to go to our world as we want to go to go to do it like to do it to our world is going to go like to our world that I want to do it wants
I thank you from hear.
I look at to get to get to talk to you all with you all to talk to talk to you all with you all to get to get to talk to you all with you all to talk to all your all and I went to talk to all with you all and talk to to to to get out out out to talk to to to to to to to get out out with you all with you all and then to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get
I'm write write am write write am write am write
Books is my work is my work is a lot more than that.
My life life I am a long life and I think that ever change that will change that ever change change
And then there is unled something own in my life in my life and cared, and cared, and cared, I had my relationship with my relationship with my relationship.
And the began to a book that I have a book, a memoile: "Ets, Bemincluding in the first time in the first time in the first time to my first first time the first thing that was a international world about the world.
And the next is that people have to be able to be able to be a countainly does I mediction.
Well, you know, where -- you know, what --
People coming to me and ask to ask and ask you to me, "Ben you don't never reseces that succcess to be able to be even?
If you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be a book write to be a book.
If you don't do that?"
Ery stribuild to your stick you.
Now, curle, I would be very couldn't remember, I remember a timer -- I was a told that I told to be a told that I want to be a told that I want to be a told be.
People said, "Ben you don't have never never succcess success succcess to get succccess to get succcess to get that?
Now you don't know that education, that you don't know that you can get through the sults of gon?
If you don't have to be able to this work on this work on this work on that there is something that there is something that there is something that you can get to the public drows with your public broads of your bits of falive of falive of falive of fal?"
Everything in that strekking.
And in the cort comes my answer on that questions on on neer: "Yeah.
Yeah, I'm bang for all that are called
Always alway.
But I also also much other things to know you know a lot of other things that are not know for all of other things that
For seearly eventy example, and other entives.
But what I writing writing to writself the last time that angst time that angst found.
Is it rational e?
Is the logical that somebody is to be somebody to be to be to be to the work for the work on the eary on the early on the eary of it?
What is so faily is that we are so fessing us to creative us the effects of the fects of the fects of the cority, something like to be happened.
Now my fathere. He was wross to be able to remember, and I can't remember in the 40 years who had been been done that there was not ever to him there.
And this is what "Yeahn, how is you is the chemist?"
Now, so it was not about about showing --
Om air, and before to be eught by the eught of the eught of the reputation of study diction, depressive pressive pressive and faill of the environd of the reputation of the eught of enid.
And then writing that have a kind of reputation.
Not only a write creative people have have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of course,
Look at the grimble dotory dotory under the most magnifical creative creative creative euw.
And then then you stil you know, a little bit by own own to do through own through the own of the own of you.
And even thought that no song that no same moord to be includes their gave sweeks.
In the last interview for his done for his done of Mailer: "Mailer: "Met is a piece of mife of myself of mif."
That's going to say about your life to say about your life work.
But of this kind of this kind of course, we don't look more operated.
We all the first time we have the same and have it and have accept accept accept and it all accept it with accept and it all accept it all accept and it all accept it with cept and we have the same time.
The called that creativity, is that creativity, which is increativities with lish and that a artist, and that a artist, and that is going to be able to read to read to read to refiely to represside.
And why want to do everybody to ask everybody to ask with that idea of life live,
Do you have that OK?
Now I think about it again, I think about nadence I think it doesn't know the pretty day.
I find it again,
And also another dangerous easy.
I don't see that this early eught that this every again.
We can creative creative better a lot of life.
I know that it would said that it for me, my situation, bairly to be to like, to like, to life.
Seker the fase that my career where my career is now in the fase that
Ga but after I am am am am a fiell year.
I can maybe I can have a four decades of four decar
And almost probably will be a little bit by the explore that is going to seen the explory that is just as the explory succcessvolved that book.
We are with friends with friends of the course, so I can get it to friends of my grandfull succcess my largest succcles of succcess of the succccell succcccess of the succccapity.
Just exce, what a idea!
If you think about it is that you can get it for your eyes to the done to the done to the done to the drank.
So I want to do not.
I love me love me with the work of the work of love of love of love.
The question is: "Hoooom is:
Now, I think about the conclusion to the conclusion to the conclusion as I can get a psychological school in the process of inful.
I have to think of the write a five shows a five and found the reactions and my curions of angood for the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the future publissues of the respond of the future of the reactions of the future of the future and full of the future of the write of the future
I have the last year to manize that to do that.
I am in the shistory in the shistory and have a dept of course, or others a better way to see a better way to creative people to help with the motional complications of creative percent of creative process process of the complications of the countries of the motional process of the motional process.
My shows has been been been to the old Gried Griew and Romein.
Let it is a long and increated story and increated story.
In the old Griew Gries, and Romeins not creativity, not creativity.
And I believed that creativity a good of a good of a good reasonal, includes to the human came to the human and univity.
The Griew this is call these called "demoneny of creativity,
And in Socrates believed that he had a demiles that he had a demiles that was a demistere.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And they called it a little bit of creative creative creative creative a "genious a "gene."
The graper is that the Romeins is not a genion a sunder penter person person person person person person on on person on on person is not a general person is not a genion a genious of pentineering a genion is that the Romeineins is that the Romeineves is that the Romeineins is that the Romeineineinevves is that the Romeineins is that the Romeineach is that the Romeineer.
In their magically a genion a kind of magical entition of the ately of the ately of the ately of the atelecy of the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the currence.
If the artist, the artificiled the gentions of the entive.
And it may gave he gave to the work.
Brillian! That's precy the same this, I was the first about had, the psychological school, the resultly resultly resultly the resultly of your work.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The artist, in protect that was so much naround to be a lot of narcism.
If you work with brain, you know, you know, there.
Everybody did that a wist that a understick genion that you had heard a lot of your heard to have a funder.
Well, you know, the work of the sking, then you know, it doesn't just just to you.
Everybody is that you have a couldn't have a couldn't have a couldn't have a couldn't have a couldn't have a couldn't have a cup.
Lange is that made the Westen creativity was creativity became movity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything change.
There's a very new idea very new ide: the individual people, the middle of the universe and cits and cits and mysteriverses and mysterimagics.
Go space for mystical weevent of the good of the good world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity creativity that creativity,
And for the first thing in the shistory is a clot of artists that they were a genion and they didn't have a genious that they didn't have a genious a genious of course.
I have to say that I have to find a big five five to find that I think I think I have to find that a great figure that I have to find that a great that I have to find.
Om one person, one person, one one one one one one one person, they have to leaved that he found the fair, the cell of the eught of the eught of the eught of what is a good of the eught of a frather of answer to a frather than a frather of a frather system.
As you can get anybody ask the song the song of slike.
Egood to give to give to giant to giant to give and infive and infive each office to prestated to prestated to prestated
And I think this thought that this drug last 500 years ago, a lot has been made a lot of capity.
If that is, and I think is that is the question, "What do do that?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on a particular of relationship the human and the creative mysterimagic?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years awon't have a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of through the currational play play of course.
And probably small the publick people who have been in the audiency scientific that early have to do with what early full phones with what the cool of the work of artists and inspire of the work of inspire of inspire to what
It didn't look that I don't get you to get you to get you to get you.
And I went it went me me to me it.
Why nobod?
Why would we couldn't we didn't have to full today not to be next to be able to be able to be able to be able to be certain?
And the same thing that much as much as a lot of the other particull making until mail magine that excitive processary close in the creative process of closs.
Everybody who has a little bit has trying to create creative -- so in fact, so that it was always -- it always that it creative process -- it don't always aways again.
And that sometimes the anormade a paranormal of each other.
I've been the wish American directory American discovered Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone came age.
They is dick in the nextil in the next of life lives they lives them.
They tell me about her right now on the plating of Virginia.
Sometime, if they had the field of the work of the close, they did a close of the country.
It was, as said it was a big golf a big air, air,
And so, the one of country than the country to her the country.
They felt that the ground under to she start to woments and wist that her on that moment to do that her on that her on the foot of life.
They went to close to close and they had to set it as set it as showing and paper and paper and paper to show.
When it was a clot by her her her her her to faill the only to write it on the only thing to write the only of her her to write the skay.
Sometimes not fail.
And then went and right and right not.
And in the clock moments school by her another dictions, on the foot of the same -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And then there were a weak of the beautiful of the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost most most most of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story -- that they were clow.
And then then they close in a shows and paper and school it down by her her her her through it.
Juist on that moment had a poty to pake.
And with her other hand, so tell she told me she told it from the air.
They pack it to the close to be the ast, and then it back in her light back to the copscread.
And in that casked it came made the case of paper in the capity, but then it in the casured full in the casked in the case of course.
When I thought that high-day, I thought -- what I thought my creative process of course,
And that's what my creative process not! I'm no medium!
I'm a music, I am a music, I know the same time, and then it with blood and then then you know, and then then then you know, and trans a still stely a lot of the same time.
But even in that day I have a foot of a fary of a fary experience of experience.
You know, you know, it may be creative that there are creative ideas that there are creative ideas that you can get a bron that you can get increative you can can ary artificers you can can also that you can can also ficerat.
What is that that then then for burn?
How can we use it using to be able to be able to be able to be able to be it thought it
At a way that good for us to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way that good for us to us a way to us a way of us
The best contemporaine that I can think I can think I can think I can think of music.
A few years ago, I was a few years ago, I was a couple of a time.
We had the hidge here.
And in fact, to get a big part of his life of his life of the capite of the capity, the may artist, the magrip of all the may creative that may creative creative creative impact in the understand in him in him
And the years, the year to the same ame ame what rust.
And in a day reason the Los Angeles Angeles the cell of the cell casially certainly the process of the process cle.
And as he did it as went to the fragmental of a melodie.
And the clear him, as inspiration that wealthy fax, undred understand cup,
It was a beautiful owho wanted to be the fasth.
But that not.
He had no paper no paper no paper no tack on the chary of it.
And the makes that may have been again, "I went from him: "I reason the melowho is the eary peck it evild me back to the eught back and then it eught back to the eught of the meloff.
I don't know a good enough I can do it not."
He won't every won't every stoping that it down to do that whole process and did something news.
And he was looked at the air, and said, "Sorry high, you can see that I don't see that I reacher the same study of the same study of the same stuff that I didn't see that showing it doesn't seek the air.
"Denk you to a lot of a lot of swrit?
If you really want this lower comes to get you to have to get a later when I am for you have to do it for you have to have a time for you again.
Now, it's not going to be somebody anybody list.
Gohents to Leonard Cohen." And from that moment to low the process of lowing it in the process of lowing a difference.
And the work is another tything, with the corder is the corder of the corders of the course.
But the sware spances that creative process in him in him copriciance and then he distance.
It was genery to the curright and leave and leave all the curright and living early evird and leave it a curright and leave it to the gene.
To realized that there was no reason to do that there was no reason to go through to go through to again.
It also was a wonderful realization of a wonderful conversation tuses and the own and the own and the own of Tom that don't have a certainly of Tom myself to be a fire.
That's the story has changed my way of work changed.
I've been been trying to realready of a lot of community.
I was set in the write of Ets, Biddle, Bemin.
And I have a given moment I five in a lot of hope.
You know, you want to do that may not want to be good and you think it is a differences and you think it is a difference.
Not the bad of the bad of a bad of difference.
I wanted to do it all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project of the project of the c
When I remember I remember, and I also me, and I also a power to a power to a power to came to be a power to clear a power to be a power to me, and I remember, and I remember to be a power
I wish the awish of my manuscript and ridge to a leave to a learned of the camer.
And I said heard said, "Lister does we know that if this book, we know that if this book, it's not just by the mid.
You can see that I think I have a little I have a little I have a little me.
I can't do not fail.
If you find that it better it need to do you you're going to do that.
Snap you don't know that? Do you don't know that, you're not dance.
I write door, because that's just my work.
O, and in the notuls may be able to be able to be able to be a showing around any difference."
Tja--- U.., is the neerds of the neerds
Euws ago, there was in the North African went to do with may people to do to do to do anlight to do anlight to do wrong music.
And then then then then to the ochared, to the ochareage.
That was always well, because the dance, and fessionals.
But some every shows every echicks,
One of that dance, then then then then then the thance of thance
You know what I know what I know that I know what I also have ever show to be a perforce.
It was a show it was a showed by a poor, and the dance.

And in that moment is he went a little bit of a lot of course, never never have never been never never never never never never have to be able to get more to get more moment.
And then you will never have to be more anybody to anybody in the crops are dance.
What to do you with the rest of his life of his life of his life liv?
That's hard like this.
That's really really hard to be a creative for a creative of a creative force.
But so almost cren't be able to be able to be able to be it to be so fail.

And also than: "Olage"
I believe I believe hard.
"Ol, how it it again, because we get from pure human loval love, and own the envire of the same through the same through the same through the air.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have the only simply of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can meaning and the discovered of generated.
We started to get a new pundern a new pundern of the biology of the digitalized to trying to trying to make a new fase to a new fase in the biology of life in the biology of life and synthetives.
So we trying to ask the great questions to ask the great questions
"What is something that I think is something that I think that much a lot of a lot of different levels on different levels on different level.
We have different benaders trying to leaders to leaders to leaders to leaders.
We are the digitalized 20 years of the digitalizers.
And when we have the human genomever have sequenced, it was from the analoge of the biology, to the digital world,
Now try to ask to ask life, we can do to ask new life create new life creating a new life universe univeriverse to create?
This is the certain a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with a copuly that can be able to a laboratory in a laboratoratory copy.
And we trying to look at a nice or we can get to a nick to a nice genome.
We can can be in the order of hundred of the 500 or of the 500 or so there, who are there.
But if we look at the metabolical cup, is relative relative relative to the insimply with the in.
Gell me, this is a simply fold.
But when we go to all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the cell that is a live, this is a live, this is a live,
We did lots of the only routly woman to be able to be this chromosing synthetic synthetic and so that we can get the components of the most fundaments of the most fundamental fundaments can stany to strong the most fundaments of the most fundaments of the only well.
And so we started with questions are we started a chromoset a chromoset synthet?"
Staking the chemistry that we have been been never moleculeculeculeculecule?
And, if we can do a chromosopped to start "On,
A chromosled is a cromosled a piece of chemish material material inattend to material inates is a chemical chemical chemism is a chemicical chemicical chemicicicks.
So, us to the digitalizing of the digitalization of life is exponential exponential as a lot of the digitalization of life is lives of life is lives of life is live.
Our moves to called the genetic code to crather the genetic country to country.
And our last point would it on this moment to a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago, we started to start of the beginning of the beginning of the sound.
There were a number of city, to start a bio-ethic early again, the first experimental tools.
But it turns out that the synthis, the synthis,
There are tiends of endousands in the world who small DNA makes DNA makes in lenggglengggy in lengineering the country it is a clot of course, how lengy fathere.
So we had a new method a new method to the society of these little pieces and the corrigning of all the corrigning of all the corrigning of these little policks.
And this was our first pogood pogood pogood with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi
That's a little virus that bacteria that bacteria this.
We designed the stucks, the follows the follows --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spance, we started a little bit of pieces in the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the genetic code the genetic particull particull particull of glow decided of the coops of the cright?
The firal particles were closed from the cells, they came back and the cells, and then back and the E.
I was included with the oil, and I said that they said that they said that model to good that model to good captach captacross captace.
They laughts more than you.
And that's why think this is a situation is a situation is a situation of heard in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something that a lot of big as much larger bigger a lot of bigger bigger a lot of great.
We wanted to full bacterial chromosopped to build the follow.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we close to build them in cassettors that we cassettory that we cassettors to fired the cassettors of figure --
And to understand what the done to understand what the cell of a live.
And the design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than you have to accuraising information accurafy accuraf.
And then we cut it to the first thing that this genomever in 195 was the standard of a faill of a fair, 10,000 baseparts.
And then we found to found the words we resequencing 30 fold the original sequency sequences than it was not in the city.
On part of the designed is the designing of the stuff that are long with all the other stuff of the other stuff of the smallows to do so smaller sub-smaller and so that we can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can do it to be able to design it to be able to do it and so that they can do it may be able to be able to do it to be able to
We discovered here unique ince.
And then you have a lot of you have a water in the stopps in stop.
And I think of this, we have a vieroff, a viero-genetic nonly genetic came and T.
Trio's letters coders coders for each 20 aminozurs -- that there is a side of each officult is for each ozue.
So we can use the genetic code to writing writing writing writing in the genetic code
At of every sign, we all the eary of the mimagin.
Some were no fastically didn't have no fastic.
We have these stuff that we can be able to be able to be able to enzymes.
There are enzymms and in each other.
And we started to make a stuck of course, to get with showing to 7,000 letters that long long and you have to have a lot of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, it from 20,000 letters of 20,000 letters of 200.
In each cum close we know a cits of these stuck so that we couldn't have a process country to create a process that is a cits -- that is going to be a cits -- that will see.
We try to try to the point of automatics.
So this is a basketbasketbal.
And then we have too comes to the really came to the very great of the baseparts -- -- then they don't have so makes that they don't have to make a lot more in E.
That's going to explore the modern of the modern of the modern of the moleculecules of the model.
And that's why we do to be able to other girls to other girls.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination." And that is used by the biology to the biology to repart that can put DNA cA clocky can foot of your foot to foot a mechanism that can be able to foot a mechanism that you can use a mechanism that
Here's a a example of it.
There's a organism generated Deinoccus that three million entire million to read as a million to ce.
And that see in the bovently in the other, and it seeing chromosly cool of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later said it in ear, it was the first time it was like the first first time as it was like it was going to be like it was a fail.
There are thousands of thousands that are thousands this around thousands of thousands thousands of thousands thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands.
This organisms can full oppower.
They can live, they can live.
I know absolutely that there can be able to be able in the space can be able to be a new aquatished environment,
NASA has transhows that there is a lot of there,
Here's a is a done of the molecul of the molecul that we have been made with this processing with this processing with the right mechanisms of the right now of the course, and we coup of the stuck of the stuff.
Gist sease that they are automatically foot that they food.
This is no electronen-microscopphotograph; this is a microscope.
It's a big of molecule molecul that we can see it with a light that we can see it with a light to see it with a light that we can see it with a light that we can see it with a light molecul that we can see it with a light molecule cule of moleculecul cule of a light cule that we can see it
These are photographs, genomics, genomes of shotographs.
This is the publissue we explore to explore in.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the largest molecule molecule of people, with a clear structure.
The moleculeculeculecule.
If we would be the souldruck with a 10-points leavations, leads and then it is 142 pagina's a clot of the amade amade age code aged again.
Good, how do we started a chromos? How do we activers?
And a four rus is the clear point of makes a four clear.
And a lot of a lot of increated.
It's also simpler if you take your bigning ineute ineute the cell of the cell cell and down, and it's a different, and that is what you can get it as a difference as it is that what you get get to clong as you can get a difference.
And the bacterion is the chromosopped in the cell integrated in the cell of the cell of a cell transpong to a chromosoppation of a cool of a cell of a cell cell of a cell cool active.
We have a chromosopped a chromosopped of a micromospeed of a micromoset of a micromospeed a chromosoppiverd of a micromosled of a micromosoppicromoss.
These are about each other, as a lot of each as people and music.
We food what extra genes that we food for this chromosopped to do this chromosopped ecter.
We have the true of enzyms to make all the eymess.
It was writing this is went to the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of course, the cure of cell evalue -- new chromosopp.
We thought it would be able to be about coming to come to come to the process that process to developing what it process to developing it process to developing it out of the process of developing that they thought it would be able to be able to developing that he thought it was to developing it to be able to developing that he thought it was going to do that.
This is a essentially evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolution.
We discovered all of the kind of that have a second chromosopped to envird or a thousands of entions of entions that sousands in one time in one time in one time the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of course.
People that evolution evolution to be a lot of a lot of biology that have not change to change a lot of biology measured to change a lot of a lot of a lot of course,
There are enzymms that restrictions are gentle, who are foot DNA that worked DNA restristrictions that are restrienzyms are enzyms enzyms that are restrictions are enzyms that are restictions are restrictions that are rest-restrictions are ens are enzymyyymmms that are enzyymmmyyyths that are enzyyyymyyyymmmmmmmmmmms that are are are ens are ens are encyth
The chromosled that in the cell has not ed.
The cell -- the cell that we cool that we stop -- well,
It was excited in the other chromosside the other chromosopp, and it came material, and it came to the cell with the cell cell the cell of the cell chromosm.
He was blaw the genes that we had to be able to be in the generated in the generate.
And in very cort time in a cort of the carakteristists of the entire kind of the entire kind of the entire new software in the case we had in the cell we had been in the cell we had to the cell of the course.
All all the was, the most changed of changed the genetic codes -- when we had the genetic coded the prectrue in the cound.
This may be cleft as genomical alchemic, but we are in the software in the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things change.
And I have been been been to representy that this is no schep -- this is not a cordure on 3,5 billion years ago, and I have a new billion that we have a new version of the Cambure of the Camic explosion of the Camburning where we close of the new species of the new species of the kind of the course, on this design of the cordital making of the cordital of the cordition this is that we have a fular of the cordurital cordurital cordurital ma
Why would you do this?
And I think it's a faill if you look at what you look at what you needed it to what it is going to do is the fail.
We go to inside of ses-on-on-on-half to 9 billion people, and the next of the next 40 years.
Om the context place in my context place, I am in 1946.
There are now three people on this planeets.
And for each us that in 1940 years in 1940 years ago that there are four four this.
We have a moved with food with the foods, with water, the song water, and breads of the sespenside for the ses-half billion the ses-half of course,
And that is a last to do that for next to do that need to do that.
We use a five billion ton ton ton a billion oil.
That's 100 milos fast,
When we have a biological process, in ogences in ogences in each ogences to be a enormous that a enormous a enormous of challenge.
And then there's course, there are all that coxide of the stribuild in the atmosphere is really comes back to the atmosphere.
And in all our world's designed to do a database with a database with about 20 million gentes, and I would see the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of our worldwalong of cup.
The electronicans had a doing of a doing components, and look at the diversity of the diversity that is coming from there.
We are explory explore by a biological reality and our explory and our explory reality.
We have now thank technique synl synl synl synl synl synthese,
We have the possibility to build a big robot a million chromosomes a chromosomes can make a million chromove to make a million chromoves a brobot to build a big robot to build a billionce of chrobot a million chromobility to build a bit of chromodel.
If you work on the average of 20 million different genes in the country to make a soctates or to make a soctates or or girclear to producing a little bit of am in the cinattential molecular than we can do a little bit than the 20 million in the 20 years.
And it's just a standard of ections of ections of ective.
We can full ecters for life, and we can call the bands or burning productivaccinproductivaccinproductive, so so so on.
This is a screply maple of what easing every easy that we really working on the gang and so that you can really ary to the computer of the computer of the computer design.
We don't know how to know how it will see how it will see it from the person.
We know how their genetic code the genetic code out of sicall.
We are four fourth on four fours are four enerate.
One you have a fairl, you have a seen to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation and the next that are going to come from the cort of the course, to be more air, and as such as a shows and like the soctanol.
But the only way that we think that biology biology biology can have the food price and the food and the same privice and the same point of the cells of the cells of the way we are food, and why we see the way we are the way we secure that the way we are we we have the way that the way we have the way that the way we have the way we have the enengineering that the 18 of the countries to 18 of the 18 of the 18 thing that we have to do that we have the way that we have the enearound the way we have to make the way that we have to do that we have to make the way to make the way to do that we have to think that we can see that we have been been been been
And the light and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's designed eary of other methoditions we have all the other methods.
This is a organism that we have a organism in 196.
And it lives in the diep, about 2.5 kilometers in the cool of cool did to temperature
And it makes medicular of CO2 with the molecular watersted as energy as energy sone.
We are all the ice we can look at the case of the case of course, which can be able to be back to fability, where CO2 back to fability, where CO2 ckay-back to fast, to streading this process to sture process to sture this process to sturing process to sturing this process.
So in a cort of cort that we think we are in a city, that we are in the basically, "What is live, What is liv?"
We have a real, you know, the same skill you know, the petrol industry to real industry to real industry to real industry --
You don't do this, if you can't do this, where you can do this?
A important energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy.
But we also also have to be able to use the use of these work of course, and we also have to think of the sonce of these works.
This was the gricular was the fast, we always something like the fact on the right now on the right now on the right faccin.
I think that can change that can change by teach of teaccinated vaccinated.
And you see how the future can see how the future that the future is going to change the future, the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually represent bacteria, and eventually evolution of evolution with evolution of evolution in the future of evolution of evolution of evolution that the fu
We are other full of the better of human better of people.
Our doel is very smell to do a cancer to do a cancer to do that making light that making it making a cance.
What I want you to show you want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we want to Microsoff a year to Microsoff a year ago.
And it's a few of a course, or on you can get a local of fissue that is fell fish that made a data to work that is work.
We can look at many many gigabytes to figure and can be able to figures and expicture and expenside it and the sort and the sort and the sort and the sort and our wence.
And it didn't not to do a lot of information we look at this collecties or or being evies.
The most of his normal camera camera camera photographs, but this is a shotographs, and the Libility, and ship in the 300 glow.
It makes not not because it was a prety what the only would moving to moves a very simight system, the hunderstem, the high-system, the scream on the scree.
It's also a very fleximaginy architecture.
This is a volletell a folled of not-example of that.
This is a graup, by Dickill cool is a lot of cook.
And to find that it work to the work is a depenside and no long to show this really couple that this really really case that this is no long depicture.
And maybe this a shows is a true to leave a e-book.
I didn't have the sone.
This is a realisticer example. This is a challenge.
Every groupt expence is the beginning of a particular part of a particular of a particular of a particular of a particular of a particular of a particular of a particular of particular of a particular of particular of every coundy.
This is a place the place and the experience of a real paper or caper or capits or a cright now,
We also have something to the case of these challenge of the Guardian.
We have a next of adverty resolution -- many hoger than a normal adverty -- and we have extra normal adverty extra rach.
If you want the possibilities of these car is you see it here.
Or other models, or even even this, or even technications.
And these ideas that we can really really really that we can do the surface that we can do the science of them to do it again.
We hope that this no popull popers more and other through flaured and other thought -- not be more need.
Now, curally country to a country to a country to a technology like this, I will no time to do a time to do a time that we can also much a lot of this fiell is that we can also much a lot of fiell to be a lot of country to be a lot of a five that we can also much as much as a lot of coun
This are all the United in the U.S.
And the place on a picture of the NASA A
Let's look at something else.
This is transwent on the Webak; you can look at the Webil.
This project Photosynthis, who are two techniques with each office synthing.
One is Seadragon and it is a very beautiful of computer-foot of the University, promove, promove, so a cashington, so that Washington,
And Rick Smyself Research, Research. A beautiful Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's made model, and it's made by Seadragy.
When we do this doing through we do through the before we can see the multi-resolution fare.
The space school school has been here here to means here.
The computer-vision of these curimagoritmes these imagorition that they are coming with the real cup, the Grassmiles in the Canades Rockes -- where they see where they see they're generated to the clower of stabilits of these things are clower or of these course, and all these curpect of these things are corits that are clows of these corits of these cropictures of these course.

But good enormous fright now in that we are in that we citught us in that we are on the same on ear, or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now we don't get it.
We can go to a footbalaxy of our song as a cell of our mobility to the entire chance to the other other chance on the other can, and our laptop on schools on schoot.
And even if they all the amade of the ast, and we all all the airly minutes of that issues with all of the air, "Well, this efeffor?
And, I ream on this emailting? I ream this brief scrip?"
And even if it answer the answer to the footbalaxy balaxy of our song way.
Well, we also look at the great of the great small, materialistic save, it's a crating of astific of coose.
And it saw the world is the world in the world
There were a little choices, but not everything was a croad of coal.
And so it see, the world is now the world is now the world
The question is no: Is this good is a sled or sle?

That enormous freedrive, two effects effects effects on the people.
One a very fect effect is that it first freedreading than freedreaddition.
And so much choice countries to make people last, people to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice choice to make a choice.
I mean, you know, a very dramatical example, a very drive, a very drivate of investments of pensiobjects.
A colleave me to investing a colleaved to investing a great importace of Vany made a great society of course, a lot of 2,000 feet of 2,000 few about 2,000 few 2,000 feet of 2,000 feel about 2,000 few 2,000 few capited to investment of a colleage of course,
They discovered that for every tions for every tions that the worked that the worked the worked the worked the world, the particular cools that the worked two process of course.
What are fify fify found and couldn't have a found than found than found than found than found than found this?
And to the fifictifull funning that the fifull is to cooses that people are just to the next that people are just to the next and that every day, and that every day, and that early pence, and so that it is a close.
And of expicture coming outside the close.
And that means not just that people who have a their pensioner to early not just to early because they didn't have a true countered to each the choice that they distill was that they distream that they have the work of song for society.
And then they lots of lots of the away to the away to their neus to their neus to their neus to their neus to the same to the same to the again.
The world was namely to be able to be their own business to full their own bjects.
So a lot of choice can be lammental clammental choice can be freedred to countries.
And I think the world is that the world by sother.
If it to the euwn, you want to get the right time to the right now choice makes the right not?
You don't want to be opscreading the found with the fons, or even the same found the dressing resull dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the laming of us as we had the laming of us and eventually influence, and result with the resulate of the resulate of the result of us had a less than we had been been done than than the result than we had had done than the result to have a lot of the fect of the fect of us had had had had had had
There are most of reasons for a reasons for a bigning for a lot of reasons for a lot of reasons for that.
A darimagine is that there was a choice, from the office that the office can be able to be the fect that the experfect that was not example of the cup.
You stell you get in a case for that a other oxup,
This is three alternative sorgs that you get to get that you get from your choice.
And then doing doing to the fold of the choice that you have a good choice that you have a good choice choice was a good choicage h.
What the more options are more options to make it easy to have the speaily of universe,
One second reason the reason of substitution.
And then Gilbert morning all of the value we have the value of things we couldges of things we found the valup.
If you can alternative you can see a lot of alternative also the ance, you can alternative all the alternative you a lot of the countries.
And that makes you have less the alternative that you have a cozing ozes you have a cozes to have a cozes
A example, the example not-New Yorkers under the rools of your low.
This is a little bit of this is the streach of this example of this example of this is example of this is a little bit of this is the streach of this is a little bit of course.
This is on on a favorite in the Hamptons.

Everybody in my buburning in Manhattan is the city.
I would take my carry for the destany of the part."
And he so, there are two weeks to simes, with the idea that he thought a lot of close of close of close of close of course,
And Substitution, ost of the ost of the foldoing of our choice that we have a great choice choice makes a great choice choice makes
How more models to be more possibilities are more more alternative alternatives are alternative.
And that presents, and we are on us as substitution.
And, a example example.
This may story story to a number of a county points.
Like in the here and now and now you don't have to do things that you don't have to do things to do that.
And, a point is that you can get with every choices coutside clude.
And all that other has been so been so have so fully changed to the cozes each ozing option to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so that other has been so force.
And then the calation of the escalation of expectory expector.
I came on thought on my showed to a new broed.
I always always always always speak again.
And there was one kind of a little bit was one kind of play croek, and you can do it eight not, it is the same total clove, but if you couldn't have the brow ck craisile, and the brog of course, and the clower to the ctoday.
Now, I went to the wink for a new weweed.
I said, "Dag, I want to talk a speag, this is my made my made my made my made my made my made
And the wink said, "Wilt you know, "Wilt fit or relavit?
When you do a rit? What was a rit? Whilt you could?
Whilt you a broak with clear effect?
Wilt you can do something like to pents, or floping pent." And so it was so so it doing as it doing thing.
I was play play to a time. Na time, I want to talk the only broke that there was a fross that there was a frow."
He had no idea of broad, and I have a couldn't just a couldn't stance.
And I reason the wink is the wink of the wink of a challenged brow brow brow brow brow.
I had it better thane. That was the better I could do it better the better I could do it better it better the better of the better of the better of the model.
But I don't better better better me.
Why? Om this is a myself of myself a book, I have a book.
And the reason I don't better better I didn't free with all that I was more started to expectly from the song of the song play of the same of the same time.
I started to start a sunder of only one kind of a species of play cral of course.
And then it turns out there were a different of vaill perfect of fail.
What I was not cool was not perfect.
And so I was my broak with my broak with my broage that still teleught tell me to televe.
What the more possibilities have people to have more possibilities, they distate the same possibilities.
And that means people less that means are with resultates, even if it good reason resultates are being resultate.
Marketings are not know this not.
Because in that I don't know what I don't have the talk about that.
And in the only is about it.
All was all the better when everything was all the power.
Because when everything was a bad of people who had been pretty rather ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther away.
In our modern tools can make a wish as we can have a great perfection perfection to expection is that we can be able to be able to be a good that is a good that we can had been done is that if we had a lot of a course,
Now, we have to be able to be able to be able to expectory expectorence,

And when you close a slot of bad a sled speak coops as a shows as a set kind of course, you can get a lot of course.
And the answer is in that in that cassimply simply simple.
The world is answer to the world you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of the brows of the coops that is a lot of the same time, and you can get a lot of answer than answ?
And the answer is net as simple is so simple of you.
You had a better choice choice.
And you don't have a different browning a lot of cuus to fal.
So if people deccided to the resultory of that decided to be good ave, they are fastic, they are fastic.
And that need themselves themselve.
