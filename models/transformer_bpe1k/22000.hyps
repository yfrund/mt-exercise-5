Forg years, I showed these two dias to show that the police capable that the last three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the reses of this specific problem because it doesn't show the disection of the ice.
The ice closer on the North Pole, in a sense of the climate system.
It was in the winter and crack in the summer.
The next dia I show is a very speed version of what's happening the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened in the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years of what happened is a very speed.
The permanent ice is clearing in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blued.
That's the year, the year, during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
And it called the permanent ice, or five years or older, is almost like blood is almost like blood, that from the body,
In 25 years of this is going.
And that's a problem because the wire of the Northern Icelebrate around the Northern IJszee warms and there's a very great amount of frozen carbon did, when it was designed by microbes in methane.
And the total amount of the total reinigion in the atmosphere, would be able to double the core of the atmosphere.

As a month capted scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.

In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It's really in the water reserves in the water reservices.
And as you could read it, are the predictions of it.
This global dred dreaked to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of natural called the world is citial and never seen a incredible and never seen fast.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the form of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
And if you look at the same from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Kook at the east area of Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every single of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drazy of the Indian instanction of oxygen in the oceans.

Oil is a problem, and voice is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the two biggest extina.
And there was a proposal to build a lot of more cition centers.
But we see a clos.

Thank you very much.
Forg year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called back with a hopdate about how that works.
So here's me. For those who were not the LHC is the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever understands in the surround.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion second a billion second a billion times a second to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition, though this is a bitious ambition,
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photos of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the ATLS detector -- 44 meter the ATLS detector -- 44 meter in diameters in diameter in diameters of the diameters of that mini.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS, so you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That care for a party of a party in the control.
It's a photograph of the first particle that that all around the LHC and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and the detector of the LHC, and the detector of the LHC, and called the LHC and came up with a piece of the first particle of the first particle of the first particle of the LHC and in the detect of the LHC, and with a photograph of the LHC and photograph of the LHC, and photograph of the HC, and the HCome of the photograph of the HC, and ctest in the detestice of ph strime of the H, and ph stree of the HC, and and and the dete, and the dete, and was was bt of the detectest of the sh of the set
In other words, when we saw that photograph at 10 September we knew that the machine working, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know whether this the biggest of the biggest of the biggest and went to Google and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page of it.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
And a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold.
And those were resources 13 thousand amper amper resilions when the machine on the full regard in full force.
The ingenious say, "No true. It's too small of you will say, "No small this."
They can do that because they super-superature are superature on whole low.
So on multiple 271 degrees between the stars, who can be able to the stars, that can be draws that strands.
In one of the constructions between the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wirelected something that were there and was a electric resistance of thousand ample ampt of thousand amper ampone-thousand ample of ampone-thousand ample of them that was a thousand ample of it was a thousand ampt of electric against that was a thousand ample of them that was a electric restance of the electric restance.
This was the result.
This is another indrugs when you realize your realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of tons and then they were invented about 30 centimeter to be a 30 centimeter inch.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have been tools when we were all parated.
Now they are back on away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC again.
We will be able to put it again, and we expect measure, so that we can go into the except what the building stones of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe we can go into the build of the universe of the universe of the universe of the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the building of the universe we can far of the universe of the universe of the the ble of the ble of the building of the building of the building of the universe of the building of the the universe of the universe of the universe of the
Now, of course, have the unhappy have the debate of the value of science the value of scientific research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be a further that we are going to be beyond the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was defail of the value of the value of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous experiments of his teacher than the progres."
Thank you very much.
I would want to start with you to ask to your kids to your kiddle to your kiddle and played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to figure out how to figure out and consciously problems to learn with the desive relationships with the side of space relations.
Rumultiply is because of the world to understand the world to understand the world to understanding us.
If a information of information that is inspired by the nation of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advisior Pattion and my flowing Jeee Kalanithi -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we were a computer of that entire mes, in place of that entire mous as a kind of constances that information to a plate fings that we can be able to put a plate with a place count of information fy cluding a little breastanck of information fied to the bjects of used in a set of information fysushing information fiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefiefs of fs of them of them of them
and can we want to leave and as we want to leave that?
This question of this question of that we decided to search a answer of Siftables.
Cort say, is a Sift of a interactive computer in a cookies.
They can be moved with the hand they can be movement to the movement detect and they detect a screen and they contact a screen and wirely contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical referred by flocks, as blocks to understand it.
And Bovendis are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the way,
And the resource of them are a physical different physical different and of their movement and of the way of the way we move, and even of the way we move, there are different new and like, there are new and like.
I will start with some simple examples of the simple examples.
This Sift is institude, to show a video game to show and others and others and others and others and others and others and others playing.
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indis next to each other, they will be interesting.
And if they are came up and they can be certain that sense of them.
and feel they feel movement and hell.
We realize that we algave that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of the interaction, as the using of the interesting of a color was a liquid of a small as the liquid was a liquid of a small of the interesting of a liquid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction of interesting that is a limits of interac
In this example three Siftables of Siftables of the core to go into a leg to go into a leg to go into a lot of course, where they are become a lot of three Siftables of the example of the example of the example to be in a leave to be color in a leg to the small in a leg of the example to be able to
And if we have a lot of course, we ggood what we go back.
There are some capable of capability for the education, form game to education, mathematics and logics and logics where we want to give things to the ability to proach, and the result of the result of the result of the education.
Here's the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci result of a simple programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic resourci of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci resulation of a Fibonacci result of a si
Here's a game that we have a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in any raround a wants to get a light at every Siftable, and shaped in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is becoming a new series of being a new series of series of capability with break capability of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are a few kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I love it out of the Media Lab, and I am to make a video of it.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this apply is that people need to be almost instructions that people need to have instructions of this applied.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they need to do is what they need to do.
Here's some other people to the test.
That's our young barrain, right-basically trip.
And it seems that he just the Siftables of the Siftables of pile pile of the Siftable.
For him were just bloces.
Here's a interactive painting a interactive painting
We wanted to learn a platform for learn tall.
This is Felix that demonster demonstrates.
He can real characters in the scene of the skift with that character of the table with that character of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of characters of the table of the table to the character of the table of characters of the table.
Here's the sun coming up the sun of coming up here.
Video: The Sun up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done than! Yeah!
For the shift of Siftables and the next to shape the characters of the characters -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a open end.
and he decisions how it walks and he decision.
Video: The cats flying away.
DM: the last example that I will show today, Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, we have developed that we have recentables a sound product like the lead, bass and drum.
Eenious variations, where you can choose what you want to choose you want to use it.
And these sounds can be injected in Siftables so that you can be injected to be injected to be injected to be injected to be injected to be injected to the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atters of a leastice of Sift are live controlling available of the reverb and filter.
They are become in, and addicated by cance.
And the general effects like tempo and encountly the entire pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: DM: We're starting with a light in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, lost a lead.
Now I place the base line --
Video: DM: Now I feel what baghtly work.
Video: And I can buy the filter to the filter to the filter to the businfect live to the effect live to the effect live to the effect live to the filter of the drums, so I can infilter the filter of the drums, so I can infive the filter of the drums, so that I can infilter the filter to the d
Video: I can cell it by the cancer of the cancer of the blocks.
Video: DM: Now I cope the movie to the base for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rearm the pattern of the playing.
So I don't have to plann, and I can do anything that I can improvise it and shorter and shorter like I want.
And at the end of the containing of the containing of the volume Sift to the left Sift to the left of the entire to the left of the end.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from a new people, and my passion of new computer interfaces that are stemed in the way our brains and working on the brains and working on the brains and working on the bodies.
And today, I had the time to you one new element in this design area of course of the possibilities that we developed to develop the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is the only core is that this is the case of new generation with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world to our world as we want it.
Thank you from heart of heart.
I look at it to you with you all and talk to you with you with you.
I'm writing now.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My life long life long I writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever will change
And yet there is a little bit of a resident in my life, and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work again.
And it started with a book I was understanding understanding until I wrote a memotion, "Eten, Bi, that very except my first work and a international excition of the world and an international state of the world and an international standard.
The result is that people have to me and always at all, and always as if I was me.
And what -- you know, doing -- doing the gots!
People come to me and asking to me and asking care to me and asking it sucare that you can never ever ever ever ever went to eval?
Don't you get you to the whole life write you're going to writing and writing out more a book more a book that people will write that people will writ?
Don't you any that?"
And, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be a teengineering that I was runm 20 years ago, when I told a teenage -- I was writing that I wanted to be writing that I wanted to be a teend.
People said, "Don't you get a bang that you never get sucess?
Don't you know, you know, you know, you know, you will go into through it.
And you don't get you that you live to this work without of this work without of this work without of your broken and you will be able to be broken on the puin of your broken with your broken bitters of bits of bitter?"
And one in that strike.
In the short comes my answer on that questions are on that questions on this questions on that questions on that questions on that questions on that questions are on that questions on that questions are coming on this questions of this, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afafrather for all those things.
Always of the time.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you want to know that all of it.
For sea bunch of example, and other engineers.
But what it is writing myself the last time that the last time that that is coming from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be able to be the work for the work for the work for the work for the work of the Earth are solid?
What is so basically increative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind of the minds, something like other work on the other thing that happens in the way that we don't happen to work us to creative the effects of the mind of the mind of creative processes that we make us to creative the eff
Take my father. He was a skull, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years that he was a little bit of it for the 40 years that he was a wonderful for it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, it was not a talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been in the centuried by the centuried of the reputation of piece of piece of pieces of manicicians are closing of piece.
And the right aware that have been like that kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human beings are the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation
Look at the grimming dodental door, under the most magnificant creative mind the 2000-century.
and many of the boy of young, often by own own to do it.
And even those of those who are not suicide a placed, under their gave gone to be aware to be aware of its to be aware of its that are not concerned to be a suicide of suicide of suic.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Meach of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a very telling about your life work.
But of these kinds of except we don't look at it.
We all heard all before and have heard it with sources all the accepted with the sourcepted with the sources.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is involvity to be includes and that a artist, and that will lead to the artist, and it will lead to the break to the break of the mind.
And so I want to anybody here today, you can do with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it is a good about it all the way I think it is not a pretty thought.
I think the resulty result.
And also dangerous.
I won't see that this century that this century.
We can creative spors a lot of better to live sports.
I know that it was for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be dangerous to live to the dark of the dark of the mind.
Seach the fase where my career now in my career now
Go one, but I'm young, I'm young, amper of a year.
I can work a four decade, four decades.
Hoogst probably will be what I will have publish another thing that I have to get the outside work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We are with friends with friends up here, so I can clapse you probably closing you, highly likely to me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think about it, you're going to be the morning of the morning to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me with the work that I love with the work I love.
The question is: "Do you go?"
And after long after long at the conclusion that I can just go by writing if I can just a psychological protection in the process inbuilding inbuild the process inbuilding inbuilding that I can build a psychological protection that I can only get a psychological protection that I can just by write a p
I have to create a securrently destance between myself, and my conferences and my controlling and my constanty of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the future.
I have been looking at ways in ways to ways that I have to do that.
I have been doing in the history and have diship me in other civilizations to see whether maybe a better way to help creative people to help creative to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been break at the old Gred Greeks and Romeins.
Let up because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Great the old Great and believed that creativity was increativity of themselves was increativity of itself.
Men believed that creativity was a good equivity of a verage place to the human bes came to the human bes and unknowledable reason of the reasons.
The Great named this tremendous of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he was a demon who had a demp that he had a words.
The Romeins had a kind of a species.
And if you were called a genius, a genius,
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius,
In their polical rewards was a geniused in a genius, in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house
And if the artist, the artist, the genius,
And he gave it to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the away that I had the first earlier talking about the psychological protect of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work --
The artists was so in protection to protect a lot of narcism.
If you brilliant work with the early regard there.
Everybody knew that was a unseem that a invisible,
Well, you know, you work up a work on you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inhang genius.
And the time was that in the West creativity was the West creativity was decided.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a very new idea of idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, attacks from the godary world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity was completely from the individual front.
And for the first time in history was the history of artists said that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to find a big wrong food.
To one person, one person is to believe that he or she was a field that he or she or she is the essentiallowed mystery, of everything is the eddom, of all the goddly, of everything is to be a fragifragility for a fragion a frager human psyche.
Anybody asking the Sun, the Sun.
Egos to gigantions to gigantic proportions and there are incredibly high-expectations of exprestations of exprestations of exprestations and there's incredibly high-fires and there are incredibly exctions.
And I think this drug 500 years of artists have been a lot of artists of artists of artists of the last 500 years of artists of the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists of artists of the last 500 years of artists have made a lots of artists of artists of artists that has made a lot of arti
If that is, and I think that is the question is the question -- "What not?"
Can we do this different this?
Can we understand back on a older understand the creative between human beings and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years we can have 500 years of humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the real spone.
And probably there are in the audience people who are realized scientific doubt about the idea that elphysics of the idea that elfully pooder the work of work to inspires to inspire the work of artists of the work of artists of the work of artists of the idea that have a locks.
It doesn't seem to get you all that I will get you.
And I ask it way.
Why not?
Why would we not have that thought that thought that thought?
It was just as much as much as all the other explanations of the total explanations of the total calculatority that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has a little bit has trying to create -- so in fact, so in fact, the creative of the creative process here, it is the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative of the creative process of the creative process of the entire world --
That sometimes almost paranoral paranoral of attacks.
I have unled unless the great American disinction,
She is in the nined. Her lives all writing them.
She told me about her jeudge on Virginia.
Sometimes, if they were on the work was on the work was felt to the close of close of country.
It was, as if there was a big wave wave wave air, and it was a big wave wave air.
And the close wave golfed than about the land to her it.
She felt that the ground, and she was started to shake her feeding that her on that moment, and it knew that her for her life.
She went home, back home, and she had to go and see it and picks.
When it was close by her her was golved to write that her was that her only to write it.
Sometimes she was not enough.
Then rings and running and running the house of the house of the house
And in the moments close of close to her it, and put it by her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another dichter.
And also there were any -- I think -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are the close of the story -- that they almost mistake.
And then she was in home to look for and paper and piece of paper and poem through its it.
Juist on that moment, she had a potoment.
And with her other hand, so told me she was the close of the air.
She was close to his return and pick it back in her body in her body back in her body and she wrote.
In that cases came the close of close that in socclose of paper -- and then in the case of paper order.
When I heard that heard, I thought -- what happens to be able to be my creative process of creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of that we heard that it --
And this works my creative process is not a medium!
I'm a mical mile, who are the same time, and the same time, and sweet up with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating and transwer down.
But even in that day I had a very equired I have a experience that experience.
You will also know it will also knowledge that creative ideas in your close of creative ideas in your correlated to be impossible.
What is that before before?
How do we use the without we can use the become a become that?
On a way that is good for us to us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musician, Tom Waits.
And I was interviewed him for a time, I was a magazine.
We had the way to this.
And in fact, a big part of his life of his life is the showed of the curious artists that from all power to get all the power of the power protect to get increative impulse of the unity.
With the 1990s was a little rust.
On a day he read in Los Angeles about the speeaway, and changed it in the process of radical.
And as he was so real, he heard a fragmental of a melodia.
The decided him, as inspiration that is does it does, understanding it.
It was a beautiful good and he wanted to the vasthing.
But it wasn't that it.
He had no paper type, no taper, not a taperiod.
The great excition is after weather again, "I went the melody of the melods, and then it turns me to the meloid backs.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it.
He was not real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can hear, you can not see that I behind the stuff that I behind the stuff that I behin?"
"Do you really know I can write a song of you can write now?
If you really want to get that this song is there, you have to be a later, if I have time for you.
And it's not going to fall anybody else did somebody else.
Ga neighbors at Leonard Cohent." And from that moment --
The work itself is the same, with the same dark of dark subtly subty subty subty subty of the same time.
But the sware exciting the creative process in him called the creative resources of genius.
It was to close to close and listed on the skin and listed only close.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to through it.
It was also a wonderful society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own aspect that was not very much of Tom was that not very much of Tom myself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had been a profits of all of a picture.
I was writing in the writing Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle --
On a came moment, I found in the moment,
You know that well-booking, you want to work and you well, it is a terrible rap, and it is a terrible book ever well.
Not just six, really horrible bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of here.
I wanted to say the whole project all the project of all the project of the project of all the project of the project of all the project of the project of all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of
And then I remember Tom that Tom that are enjoy to his genius, and I decided to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to his genius.
I wish from my manuscript and I went to me a leave camer.
And I said heard said, "Listen thing, we know all know that if this book is not just by the mile, it's not just by me.
You can see I see everything I have in the stop I have in the stop I have in me.
More can't give it.
And if you think it need to be better can, you have to do your thing.
Stop? Do you don't do that, right?
I write out of the work.
Oh, and in the notles are going to be a different of the office is a different."
And you get the -- United it comes up here, it comes here,
Euws ago in the North African desert African desert people to dance to dance in the North African wish music.
and then hours and hours to the morning global called the morning glors.
That was always great because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometime, there was a very break something that happened something like this.
One of that dancers was transcendent.
You know what you fits is what I mean, you know, you also have something, you also have secure to a performer.
It was as if the time still and the dance and the dance of the primary stape.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights and now everything together.
And suddenly he didn't read a human being.
In him, under him, bove him gly.
A good fired of the fired him.
And if something like this, people who had happened to be what it was Dan they started claps and close to clapse, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, Toen the Moren Span, the Moren Span, they were continue to me.
The challenge is real by the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ole Ol, officians of the centuries.
That hire you today the day at died, and flaments.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible, or magically going, "Allah, OK, off, off, all the time, off, brabrabrabbrabbrabbrabbrabbrabbrabbrabbrab."
One of the way of the God.
Precipies what we need it.
Last, the real is that the dance of the next morning to the next morning that he discovered on dincluding 11 hours in the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning that he
And at that time, it's a little bit of the older man with past, which is never going to be able to be more to be able to be able to be able to come to the bad to zull of the high.
Maybe never going to be anybody God anybody God attacks are dance.
What should he save the rest of his life of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell to sell a creative mind.
But so painful is not need to be the way.
Imagine not a lot of exciting that the most unusual aspects of your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe them a while, you know, she was a while, to specificate of a not true specificate of a sources of a didn't refick to specificate them a time,
When you ready clow it down to somebody else.
That's what it protect is all the time.
I handly infect inside of thought that I thought
The last months I worked on a book that in a book that inside of the book that a lot of that much for a long reach to the book that a lot of reach reach to the book that is going to be a book that inside of a book that is to get a book that inside of a book that inside of a book that inside of a book that is going to be able to be a b
The follower of that illuster progress.
And if my thought with me to the hold of the hold of the same be: We're not banking.
That just your work.
and just your thing, what's it also it's also there.
If you is too dance, and dance.
If the good engineering you is being you decision to get in your work on enious something of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful that you are in the moment
And the thing happens that not, then, but then dance it down
And also then, "Ol.
I believe that harted.
"OK, how it is because we have from pure human love and own wisdom by the way, and own and own wisdom by the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I had a couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what it can meaning, and what it can means of new seases.
We started actually from a new point of point we were the digitalize of the digitalize of the digital code to a new phases to a new phase in biology to go to a new phase and synthetic designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of the big questions.
"What is something that I think what is I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different levels on different level.
We tried different approach to minimal componently.
We are almost 20 years to the digitions.
And when we have sequenced, the called the analog world of the biology, to the analog world of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer.
Now we try to ask life is we can regenerate life, or can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe of this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome of a kind of that can be a kind of that can be able to be a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a small organism,
And we tried to look or we can get to a nice or a smaller genome.
We can go in the order of hundred generating from the 500 or so that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relatively relatively with the in.
And so the simple, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all the genes we can extinue that it would be a living cell that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell cell that we can live cell live.
We decided that the only route forward was to be this chromosphere, to synthetic so that we could have the components to be so that we could be able to ask the componently questions to ask the most fundamental questions so the most fundamental questions so that we could ask this chromospeed to be so that the only well.
And so we started with questions with questions as a chromosphere, "Can we have a chromosphere?"
Stake the chemistry of this very great molecules that we never seeing before we have never seeing before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosphere, "Cromosphere?
A chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemical iners --
So, our tempo of the digitalize of the digitalize of life is exponential well.
Our power to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of a slowly, but is genome.
And our last point would it be at this moment would places on a exponential curve.
We are started here, over 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical tship to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to that.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making pieces in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it a piece, and how longer you make it there.
So we had to have to make a new method for the society of these little pieces and corrigerate of all the wrong of the wrongs.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the bicks, did the foltcorrection,
and had a DNA molecul of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part we started a piece of chemical stopped chemical stop, and the bacteria grid of the genetic code and viral particles.
The viral particles were solving when we were sold from the cells, they were cells, they were back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unled in the oil industry, and I said that they were to the oil industry, and I said that they were to good snaps.
They laughts more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software in which are own in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettty of viruses, so we could cassettty the cassettties of viruses, so we could fired the cassettty of viruses, so we could build the cassetttty of viruses, so we could fired the cassetttes of viruses, so we could decided to build them to build
And to go to understand what the real components of a living.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that it needs to be very accuraft.
And when we first first was the first time to the first time in 199, the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 basepares.
And then we found after resequencing after resequencing 30 folts. If we had the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start the original sequencing of the original sequencing of the original sequency.
And the design of the design is the design of the designs that are 50 letters of the other pieces of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they can build to build so that they can have to build so that they can go together.
We designed here, we designed here.
Maybe you read reading that we have read water in stop.
And think of this: we have a cell genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters are coders for back 20 aminozers -- there is a only response for each aminozero for each aminozur.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to writing words.
And Avancement we only called "The only might be a mom.
Some of course, that were not close that there were no closs.
We have these pieces that we can design them with enzyming them with enzyming.
There are enzyms that they repair and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters of the long of the long and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 24,0000.
In each stadium we want to create a continue so that we want to create them to create them to create a process so that we want to create a very robust.
We try to reach automation.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really great pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow easily more in E.
It was going to be the expensive of all modern tools of molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist, "homology recombination, that is used by the biology to repay DNA to repay and clock together.
Here's a example of it.
There is a organism called Deinoccus radio radio radio radio rather ence.
That you see in the top paneal, and the chromosphere, and the chromosphere.
12 obs 24 hours later, he was the again, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely operated around.
They can life in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can be life in the space can be moved, that can be moved to move in space that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has trust show that there is a lot of of here, there's a lot of here.
Here's a real micropphoto of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with the right design of the right design of the right design of the pieces that we were in the right design of the molecule that we were in the design of the molecule of the molecule of the molecule of the
And it's care care that they automatically concerned together.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a regular microscope.
It's such a big, molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish we understand until we understand
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule ever by people, with a clearly structure.
The moleculecule weight is more than 300 million of soil
If we would have the closing with a 10-points letter, without speak 142 pages only to present the genetic code away to drug the genetic code away to drug the genetic code away to drugs it was a 10-pages to presses the genetic code of the primars of the genetic code of the
Ad, how do we start a chromos? How do we start it.
And with a virus is the clearly easily.
And with a bacteria bacterial is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give under eukaryots, like whether you whee the cell of the cell and does another in, and that's what you know if it build know.
And in the bacteria species of the chromosphere, in the cell of the cell but we have a full transplant transplant to a chromosplant to a chromosly to a chromoshe.
We have a chromosphere, a chromosphere,
These are about so far of each other, as far as people and mice.
We found some extra genes so that we could select for this chromosphere.
We have the fred with enzyms to make all the egggars.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will go into the very avanced graphic images here, and you will be able to be able to the cell of the cell of chromoship in the cell of cell --
We even thought he would come to show it would come to be able to develop the process of developing what further out of develop.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of all sorts of a second chromosphere, or a third or a third somewhere they were found in a thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who imagine evolution proposed to be a lot of biology have not a lot of biology have been clocked to be a lot of biology have been realize to be a lot of biology or evolution to imagine evolution to propossible evolution evolution to imagine evolution to propossible evolution as if there are one of the biology of the biology or or or or or or there is a change of biology or any of the biology change of biolog
There are enzyms that restriction enzyms that actually DNA real realize DNA resh that really is DNA referenzyms of realize restriction-enzyms that are restriction.
The chromosome, in the cell has not ever eating it.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stopped -- well,
It was expression, and the real referior the other chromosphere, and it was a strange of the new chromosphere, and then we had the cell with the new chromosphere.
He was a blue of the genes we had stop.
And in a brief time all the characteristics of the characteristics of one species, and changed it in the new species, and he changed on the new software that we stop.
All the way of changes, the membrans of changed -- when we read the genetic code -- when we read was the precisions in which changed.
This may be clinking as a genomician alchemist, but we are in the change of the software DNA, to change things fundamental -- to change things fundamental to change the software of the software of the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change the software as a genomical alchemistry, but we have to change the change of the software of the software t;
And so I have been paid before this is not a sketched -- this is a breakthrough at 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have become a new version of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran explosion of the Cambran, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it is to look at what it is.
We're going to be short from six-half to 9-half to 9-year-old correctly the next 40 years.
To place it in my context to place in 1946.
There are now people on this planets.
for each of us that affect in 194, 40 years will be that there are four years.
We have to have a food, with food, with the care of care of cleans, medicine, burning a half billion of billion of a billion of billion.
That's becomes to do that.
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion fire.
That's 100 million fats a day.
When we have biological processes in ogenschoul, or any process than any process to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge of biological process than that.
Then of course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
And for all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had been a doing different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that was coming out of the diversity that had come out of the diversity that was come.
We are prettty concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now thank you very fast synthese, fasticians to do so called "combinations of the combinations of the combinations of synthese.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can build a million chromosomes a day.
If you put 20 million different genes or resources or resources to optimize octan, or dealize or medicine, and new vaccines, we can produce a small team of team biology than we can do more molecular to molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life vatability, chemical or production, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design of what real design, so you can really go to the access and a new species on the computer can go and design a new species on the computer can design on the computer can design a new species.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code of it.
We focus on fourth generation now generation fires.
And you have seen you found to ethanol you can see a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation of fuels that are coming from coming from the sugar, to more sugar, to more sugar, to more higher fuels like octanol.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have big influenced without the food price and the available of the available of the available of the cells of the cells of the way we have been cells that we are cells that we designed the first fidence, and we think that the first fidence, and we five the first sources of the first time we have been about 18 months to have a breast.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered of our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods of other methods of different methods of different methods of different methods and CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method --
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea half miles of miles deep, at coin, cooking it cooks.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy source.
We can look at the time, we can take CO2 can be able to take CO2 is that can be fabried to fabried to fabried back to fabrish this process to fuel this process to fix this process.
So in a brief of time, we think we are able to be able to break out of the basic question of the basic question -- "What is life?"
We actually have real, you know, -- you know, the core of the purpose to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, what?
A important energy source become become
But we also use to the use of these workies of working fast to include faccines fast.
This year, we were the flu was just just a bit behind the facts of the facts of the right is coming on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the way of change vaccine.
Here's how the future of it can go from the future of the future of evolution is going to change with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually eventually evolved in the future.
We are other far from the improve of the improve of people.
And our goal is to certain that we make a chance to survive a long enough to do that. Thank you very much for the lives.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have a new technology to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can get local or on the immense of fish data can work on the fish data can work on the way that you can work on the way that you can work on the environments.
We look at this is a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can continue in the moment, and extended to our wish, and the sort of terribs to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big, how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapix.
It all doesn't matter because it's only what the prestations would be influence, on a same system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image data.
This is the grauwe house by Dickens. Every collect is a heads.
To prove that it is actually text to be real text and not imagination, we can do something that this is really text -- this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of a book way to read a book.
I wouldn't have it to fire.
This is a realistician example. This is a example.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or a real paper or capite or capach or a single medium.
We also have done with the core of this exciting of the Guardian.
We have a named advertising of higher resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal adverse -- and we have extra extra normal adverts.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make the limits of the screen of actions of them can do the screen of them can do the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-hope and other thought flaure.
Of course, a for the hand for the hand captured of a technology as this, I will spent to a technology here, except that we can spend a lot of that we can contributs.
These are all the weighs in the U.S.
And the pictures of the NASA --
Let's look at something different.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who connected.
And one of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful-vision research of the University of Washington, and the University of Washington Seitz on University of Washington U.W.
and Rick Srick Srki Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have been continue with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rocian Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadean Rocciety of stabilized diasht diasht diashit or panorama or pance, and all these things are space are space well.
I don't know sure or there is time or there is a different time to show or any time.
There are a lot of space there.
And I want to be a of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we were working in my head -- to communicate what I was in my head of the real force, in the work of the environments of the environments on our website.
We had to love to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames with Flickr. You search in Flickr. You search in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and get images of the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and get from the campus and the c
And each of these orange is giving a image of the model of this model of this model of this model of this model of model in the model of this model of model of this model of model of the orange of the model of this model of model that was a lock to be a image of this orange of orange that are basically in the way from this orange of mal that are the part of the each of this orange of the orange of the orrower that model that model.
And so these are all Flickr images that are in this way.
And we can close on simple of simple wish and
You know, I had never thought I had ever thought I would ever work at Microsoft would work.
It's government to be so found here.
I believe you that these are many types of camera's camera's camera's flexcameras, a great number of cameras, a great number of cameradicamera's camera's camera's camera's in this environment.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much of the faces and through it.
And the whole between this is even a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also good at the program is by the program of the program.
If we were in the poster in dumes, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody of the whole collective memory of the hear, on the Earth -- and buy that everything to elect that everything to else anything to else that anything to each other.
All these photos are become with each other and shapes together than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the ear.
And that was a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it used in complexity when it use the benefits for the people who are using for the people who used it.
Their own photos of metaph-data that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else
And if anybody would want to be a clips and their names and their names, and then my names, and then my photographs of the Notre Dadicates that I can use the metape of that data, and then that metaphold of the metaph-t-tos of all of these slights, and creating a kind of crue modal, and created a kind of crue modal, and creating around.
And of course, is the by-product of a immense of immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from air.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Hab I start to understanding that what it makes your software possible, in the next years, all images that are deviolence on the world can be able to the world together?
BAA: Yeah. What is really discovery.
The creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that the basis of the data in the images.
And that is designed exciting when you think about the richchallenge of semantic information that mantic information that mantic information that are many of these images.
When you look at the web looks for images, you can see a search a search and the text of the web page of the image of information about what the image of the image of the image of result of the image of the image of picture.
What if you pictured that is to all your image is to all your image?
Then the number of the number of semantic connectic connectic continue of the bator. It's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible.
One of the intense of reports and research of eating eating edge of eating the old to life between them, and they are not forget the old of the result of wind, that are felt in regard in the wind, the true of the polish stons, the profound planbs in bitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still recently realize the Milky or that the myths of Inextended to the Milky of Inven-old books, or that in the Himalaya boodhist of Dharma, remember to the bood-bood-book-oooove of the anthropology of the anth, but it's not a bomical of world in a bunch of the world of world of world of the world of the workill of the world of working of the working of the myth.

So it can't be surprised that we all have the way of sings, and art art and art art and art art and art art and art art of art and art art and art art of art and art of art and art of art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritme of the dance in every different culture.

I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shults, to convince -- a man who was a psychedge of the psychard of psychard in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean that these tryptamines are not to identificate as hallucinating, because when the effect are effect intreating intract his hallucination to experience. Tryptamines are not order to experience. Tryptamines are not oral dishe: monoxiday in the human darmously darmouth, oxiday.
They can only oral oral to be encount with something that the souldn't mean effect of the samine of the souldn't mean effect of the souldn't be the samine of the souldn't be the samine of the souldn't be the samine of the souldn't be engineering in the samine of the souldn't be in the souldn't be encouldn't be encous to be the oral oral oral oral oral to be to be to be to be of the samine of the samine of the samine of the sount of the sount of the socifect of the socifect of the societs.
The fascinating is that the better carbolines in the lion the lion the lion the lion samine, the tryptamine, and the tryptamine of the tryptamin, how can be the question of the early of the early 80,000 plants two morfological area of 80,000 planning species that are in a biofficial field of the particult of the particular of the particips that are bold of the part?
We say eufemistic "trial and reside a resire, which is becoming as a meaning count.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to uns." Deagainst us." Deak, the Cofan, the Cofan, who are 17 variants of ayahuca, who can identify in our eyes would identify of the eyes would be a kind of money.

And it turns out you can see all the 17 species in a night in a night in a full moon in different showing in different showing in a night in different sings.
You try to be able to be able to Harvard, but it's a piece of book than meelus.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is even under us that sympathy of us and curious of indicately, they're seeing the small of us and color, but reduced to a foot in history of the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, means our world, meaning our world, means our world, means our world, dealing the real world, means that we have been a curious of the history of our world, and shows of us and seen the hip of the hiftor, and say, and say, and saftorrowners of the problempath, and shot of us and sh us and ses, and ses, and ses, and shether than the ree of the ree world --
The truth is that the 2000-year-old years is going to be his war or his technological innovations, but earlier as the time we were in the state of it. And active particips or passive particips or passive particips of biological diversity and cultural diversity in planet.
All the cultures have always to a dance with new life of life possibilities.
Techtechnology is also not the problem.
The Siouxindians not Sious when they stops their pil and tree and tree and tree and tree and tree and tree as the Americans stopts Americans and then their horse to be Americans and came up and came up and clock up and way.

Genocide, the physical exciting of a volf universal realized universal result, but each developed a ful, not only not just a distributed in a lot of areas part of a developmental strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to care to fat, until you get on the basic level.
I have one with a young colleague 9,000 miles about country of Chenggth of China to Lhasa.
And then I was in Lhasa came to the face of the statistics that you hear.

And finally it comes up up the choice.
While we have in a five world of one or want to live a color?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead said that she was that she direction, that she was a bunch of amorganiar move.
We would not only see the human image image become a smal, model, and we would be able to a smal, but we would have been forget to a small options and forget it that there are also other options of options are also exist.
We can feel us feel in the idea that our species of the idea that our species are about 150,000000000000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was our agriculture, where we gave us to the cult of the shape, when the poster of the shaman being the provides of the priests and we shot a shape of the priest of the priests and we were came 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history history is not the idea that we have all the answer of the answers in all the answers of the questions have to come to our path.
If the intell the intell cultures of the world to be asked at the meaning of the world they are with 10,000 different stems.
And it is that we will discover again, we will discover the capacity to be able to be what we are, a full species, which is the work of the gard of the gard of the gards, and can do all the garban moments of optimism.
This picture I have on the northern of Baffin Island genomes, when I was went up with Inuits on narrowing with Inuitarwas.
This man, Olayue, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadean government is not always for the Inuitve. In the 1950s were the 1950s were to recently to referred our souldn't have been place.
The opa of Olayers of Olayers to go.
The family peace for his life, and then him him all his wapens, all his regards.
Now you have to understand that the Infrom the collapse of the colle; they make it of the colle.
The glish of their key became orrespond of their bookaribooks.
Olayuks up for the pollnast, or the storm that wire walking on the storm that well.
He went out to outside his brows of sea regard skin his hands and put in his hands and the pride of the pride of a limme.
He was a low-by-sel speak on the side of the mess.
And when it was solid a dog of solid it was a dog.
He difound the dog and improvised a harnas.
And then the ribbreak of the ribbasticians
He was a hounded in the neighborhood, and disappeared about the ice flat, including poems.
Over with nothing around comes around and this, in a lot of operating symbol for the West and all the indicates of the indiculations of the indiculation.
In april 1999, the Canadean government government the whole of the country of a piece of country and Texas samps and Texas samps together Nunavut.
It's independent area of the groundarid.
It's a amazing example of how a nations of a nations of enough to her people can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a native example of how a native example of how a native example of how a native example of how a native example of the example of how a nations of example of how a native example of the nations of example of the remain of the course of the count of the remakes of how a nation.
And finally, I think it's clear to this up, at least for who is at least for who is saved to this home of the world is saving, that she was really really not away away away to far all the way of clear.
They are somebody's home for home to home home to home home to home home to home home for home to home home for home to home home for home to home home home of home home home to home home.
They are standing of the human imagination, that are going to start to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time. And for us to all the time, as the onze, part of a unclean of the uncleaning of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extinction of the idea that politicians never reaching something that was reaching a politicians of the idea that politicians of the idea that politics of the idea that politicians are reachieved to be accounts.

We make a lot of resimply regard to the eath of the public, to our audiencultural places, to the continue of the increating of what he sees out of what he seems so that hopefully the major opening opening the anthropology will go to a momary and read inside of the anthropolicy of the multural of the world and plure of life and plure world to live in a multic world and plure world and to live in a plure of the most of the make, and plure of the make,
where all the wisdom of all the volves of all the volves of us are sawing.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about you about some questions that I want to talk to you about a book a book of the book that I have a book of a book of course.
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain that you may be a bit of you may be mistake.
And I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma light as following the follows on the highest levels on the highest level, we have to get them to individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a essential part of the human existence.
And the fields are freedom, to reach us to reach own insight, to reach a higher wonderful to reach without of this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wonderful well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be during that nobody would be durved in our off.
And in our life is the dogma celebrate of the age of course.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about thressings.
And at that 175 can-ency of the 175 can-virgins are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets and developing different balsamicoil and a different balsamicos of different balsamicos and a different bar.
And that is the case of you can make a tallow drive drive species, for the case of you don't have anything to you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can start to be your stroneoset of the stronger -- airly, cassettespecially game piler, cassettespecially --
And in that one electronics and you can choose out of this is what you can choose out of this attack of this attack of electronics of this is what you can choose of electronics and pick of the electronics of the electronics.
You can see a six-half million different systems with substics, with subject of the real resources of that share from that story.
Give -- then you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could go to all the kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You went to the home of the wind of it.
That had the fairt that was never happening to be a piece of it.
That time is a bit of time.
And today, there are a lot of different sticks.
And the diversity in cell phones is the diversity is imment.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with middle middle player, and crenebring crenebrating up and crently crenebry.
Well, you know, you have this model in the store of you face, but you can see there is a certain that that is happening in the wind of that happens.
The consequence: people come to the wink and asking this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question to the answer question to the answer to the answer question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that que?
No.
It's not possible to buy a cope that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the society of spulls, is this explosive increase of choices are a fact.
And health care -- it's in the United States in the United States -- and that you have to the doctor and tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says thing, "We can do that, or we can do that.
As has this other, and names of this other,
There is this object, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do says, "Do what?"
And the doctor, "As this other, and then this other, and To-To-piece.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you was, if you were me to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And that now we call "own inbring the patients."
That was very positive, but means in fact, in fact, which is the slight of decisions of decisions of somebody -- to a leave of things -- to a leak, someone who are certainly dishe's a certainly dicisions of certainly dicisions -- the patient of patient -- the patient of patient gene recorives are getting a lot of clean.
And the core of the case that ners, because the goal, because the purpossible of you and I can't buy it.
Why do it is recently, if we can't buy them?
Because we think we are the next morning our doctor to ask our doctor to ask that other markay.
Our identity, yet a sing-price aspect of us existence, is now the way to see.
Our identity, is solving our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it.
Every charge in the morning of the early you need to think what you want to be you.
Let's talk about the marriage, the crawly.
There is a time that freedom that freedom from the automatically fastically from that you can trust as possible, and then then it was so quickly as possible.
The only real choice was with whether and what you did and what you did did.
Now freedom everything for the opports.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I have developed 20, which I have developed 200.
They are not domber or like, or like, or like,
No, they have the drug with choices with choices
"Well, I married or not? Are I trust now?
Or I will I wait to wait? No I first children, or a care?"
These are all fits of these are questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, as this means that they don't have a lot of their house work and therefore not a good cle.
And they are right. It's the important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just the technology of that technology is still to work every minute of every minute working -- includes in the Randolph How do you -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There is a place, which I think I love secret secret of the go.
I don't foccasions, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, that huge choice freedom of work in that we are going to be asking us in that we are going to work on the time, or now whether we go to work or not.
We can look at a footbalsy of our son the one side of our son the one side of the offician -- and our Blackberry to the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all get from standing at the time, are we all all minute of that again, "Well, I asked all the kinds of question?
As I respond to this emailt mailtary?
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience, we experience, we experience, in a very different way.
Where we look at it, the group, the grouin, materialist -- life is a question of choose is a question of choose is a question of choose.
That's what the world was looking at the world there.
There were a little choices, but not everything was a questions.
And so the world is looking at the world now
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad whether whether whether this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad whether it's a good or bad or bad or bad or bad well?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we are good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two effects of human effects on human effects on human being.
A very contract effect is that it is working before the earlier than bread.
And with so many choices are finding the people to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the investiguons in free-understanding planns.
A colleaguard of me came to investment to invest of Vanguard, a big policated society of Vanguard, a big policians of 2,000 feet of cities.
And she found that for every 10 policated fundred the working, the particular two percent of the worket of the worker two percent of the working.
Fif-fif-fifth of five fundred of the five fundress. Why?
Because it fiff fif-fified is so lasting that people are just the choice to the next day, and that that are just the next day, and so on.
And from the straight comes from the sticking.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensioned after their pensioned to eat the time, because they don't have enough money and they were the choice that the choice of the choice that they have the worked for that they have been working for the working for them.
And that was salize of the way that they went to their nose for a year.
The worked was family to double, to double,
So a lot of choice can work on a lot of choice.
And I think the world there's so from the world of that.
If it goes, when it goes, you want to be very much to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be sit up with the wrong founds, or even the wrong three or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we did the distribution of us and choose to the result of our result of the result of the result of the result of the result of us if we had less options to be as we had less options and dished.
There are members for that,
And one of the thing is that there was a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice of choice, the choice was not perfect that the choice.
You stral you in such a case for that another choice would be better to be a different choice better of the choice would be a different choice better of that another choice would be in a case to that another choice that was better of that another choice that would be a different kits better of that would be a different kits that would be better to be a different to be in a different to be
This is dried alternative alternative care of your choice.
And then does break on the choice of the choice that you have made you have made a good choice.
The more options of the more options of the easier to have the muscle of understanding of the early every early early of the correct of the concerned of the picture.
A second reason has to do substitution,
Then Gilbert gave from morning to how often the value of things that we depended the value of things we depent.
If you can ind a lot of alternatives you can see all the same soil, you can see all the alternatives of all alternatives that you wish.
That makes you that less tevel with the alternative that you have chose to the alternative you chose it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example.
This is a stel on vachance in the Hamptons.
They have a second wound.
They are still strand. Stract again. Go way.
Don't be it to that? "Ferdik," that gustance," that gustands --
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of the city of the neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city of the c
I would be able to flet my car for the door."
And he is to simply simmes, with the idea that he was a great parking place that he was a great parking place fail.
Substitutic costs are going to be cost of the voldoing we have from our choice, even if we have a great choice.
The more possibilities of the possibilities are alternatives are there.
And those presents, the presentation costs to us as substitution.
Another example of the example
This pictures to a number of point to a number of points.
Life in the here, and now you have to go.
And one thing is that you have a point is that you exclose to the choices of choices
And all that other has so his own offices, which the result option is less attractives less attractives.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this at this, my search to a new brow.
I always always speak to always
Because there was only one species of these broek, and that cost totally and that cows are not incredible unch of the brows incomfortable, but if you were enough the browing and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough the right, it was the right OK.
And after years I went to the wink for a new weed.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a speak a speak this is my mak."
And the store said, "Wilt you smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Wilt you or a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a browing with slight?
Wilt you something except a little bit of pipipely pipelle." And so he was so well.
I was talking about it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to be the only soid.
He had no idea that was that was that and so I had a close for all of the possible browing all the possible browing of all the possible brows.
And it was a honest, I listet the wink with a excition of a brow.
I had the better day. I had to do it for all that possibilities.
But I don't feeling it.
Why? Because this is to explain myself, I wrote a book of myself.
The reason I don't feel better felt with all that choice, was that I started to expect more expect of a good spedition of a good speedition of a good spedream of the snitude of the freedom,
I started without there was a only expectation, but one species.
And then it turned out there were different to be different of the time, and one of that would be a fits
And what I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a called my browing with my expectations, and that stelted me and that stelt me telling me me me me to expect my brow.
The more possibilities people have to expectations of the services of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevel less teving.
Marketings don't know this it.
Because in that case I know what I'm talking about now.
In really the way it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was was bad to the people were pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society can be as a citizens as well-citizens and expect what we can act it is so good as we can act it way.
And we are being surprise, because our expections, my expections, my expections, torentorents, torents, torents, torents, torents, my expectations, and expections, my expections, torence, my expections, torence, and ex
The secret of happiness -- this is all come -- you all of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness --
I want to be a carry -- a car biographically elemental -- that I was tried with a woman who really fantastic is a wonderful fantastic --
I didn't have a text with less teving.
But with less enough his good cans.
And finally, you know, when you bad a bad bad of bad bad broek as there is a kind of front of front, if there is one of a being what you are about wonderful to wonder.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsible of you, you had no choice.
But if there were hundreds of different browing available and you buy build a that it turns out to fall, who is the responsibility?
The answer is just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different browing you don't have excus.
So if people decisions of those decisions of those decisions of those decisions of those decisions of the choice.
And they were resulfits themselves herselves.
In the Western society clinical depression of the young generations are higher generations of the young generations of clinical society of clinical society of clinical society of clinical society of cles.
A factor -- not the one, but a significant factor in this explosive increase of depression and itself-myself, is that people have so often television of the depressions of experiences.
And if they were trying to explaining themselves to explain, they are the described itself.
So the netoresultain is that we have objective across of the fire, but our bad bad of the bad fellow fellow fellow
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is to get to where is is being encounts.
But that's not.
It doesn't have a draght that can choose better than you can't choose automatically that's more choically better that is more choice better --
There is a magic foundary abilities. Well, I don't know that.
But I know we have been a long time for the point that choice is that choice are well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost ready -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can keep us -- I am almost of a basically -- I am almost of the best of the best of the best of that we can love us the best of the best of the best of that we can keep us to ke
The choice in industrialized countries in the material countries from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about the problem is that there is a lot of choice, but it's a lot of choice.
And the paradox I talk about here, so with name for the modern, wonderful for the modern, wonderful West West far.
That's frustrating and this is frustrating here: Steve Levitt you went to install and distill distinct children, and read of your money.
I say you about this three, intraitchoices -- they help -- they help not. Erger -- they don't help it.
They make us live less value less
And if a part of what people in our society in our society of the choices of the choices of countries that people have to have a little bit of the people would have to figure out of the people would have to figure out of the people were going to figure out of the people in the business of that people are going to be able to make
And we have to go on the obvious of it.
That's what economists a Parea of economists.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have with our meeting with us.
And to find this image, if you read this image, you're like to read as a developed human saying, "Ach, what do you know fis?
None is possible, in a fish."
A write imagination, a short-a-shiftation.
But the longer I thought, the long I was that this fish is that this fish is that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you breaks the fishing to create possibilities, but lamong no freedom, but lost, lost you know,
If you the fish to create possibilities to create possibilities.
It leads to more distribution and less teving.
Everybody has to be a vision of course.
This is a freedom, and it's a certainly -- possible, but it's certainly for us.
But the discious of a figured figured is asking to each and, unheill of a figure, unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
