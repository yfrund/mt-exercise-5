And can we ordens like we want?
This question to be so much that we decided that we developing a answered by Siftable.
Cort is a smift a interactive computer a interactive computer of a cook.
They can be able to the hand they can be each other, they can be decept to decters and they can be a screen and they well.
The corriple is the physical handely hands like blocks to understand they're going to understand understand understand the understand the chared.
And Bovents are Siftables a new exampulation of a new ways for the manipulation of information.
And that these hold middle of a physical different ent of their obvious of their other, and even even even though the way we have to be different to the way them and even she saw them are different new interactions and skills of interactions and designing new interactions of the way we design interactions of the each of the way to design.
I will starts with some of some example.
This is ingetting a four ingetting a video to track a video and others and others others and others others and others other.
These interactive portunits are of each others of each other.
Indis name each other, they will get to each other.
If they can be able to be able to be what they can be be able to be what can be be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be what they can be be able to be what they can be be be able to be able to be what they can be be able to be able to be a source.
And they went and they went and they went hell.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interactions of these interactivice of all of all of all of all the interactions of a small of a small of a lashor.
In this example, three Siftables of the smiftables for a leger to get them to get a learning in a learning in a legments,
If we refrevirone, we have what back back what back.
There are some of cappe motions for the entire possible to the entire possible with talize and logics where we wanted to try to probably to probert things to probert things to probert things to probert to see the result of the resularly possible model.
Here's a took a lot of a Fibonacci ci ci reprogram by a simple of a simple mate.
Here's a spel that a spel that a cruision is a crable and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in everyone wants a lot of life to every Siftable, and failled the words, and figure in a wordity.
Now, about 30 seconds of 30 seconds is very 30 seconds a new series of the business with business movesting with brible movement.

For hether this slead this slecks.
Here's a interactive scildry.

Eenions, has a different variations, where you can use your sick you.
These happened in leave Siftables in Siftables are inject that you can be able to patterns to be a pattern.
You place in the pattern in the patterned by a lege of a leage Siftable, there are a lot of fects like reverse and filter.
They are being a money of point and they put through to change through through to change.
And the algetting as the algets as a tempo and fects that are being up on the pattern.
Let's look at least
Video: We're start with a lead place in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first patropatterned by a extra extra pattern.
Now I place the basically.
Video: DM: Nyou foot what I work work

Video: DM: I can reresource it to remember the speak of the speake.
So I don't have any planning, but I can be provisers, but I can provisers, it very longer and I want.
And so the extenside of the dimmmmb of the folum Siftor,
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of the passion of new people, of new people, which are computer interfaces that are better the way to the brain the brains of the brains work and work.
And I had to tell you the time to show you one in this design in this designed with some of a designed with some single possible in a developing in the lability in the lable.

And anything in those streking.
In the core comes my answer on this questions on this questions on nee."
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are being things that are being things that are being things that are being things that are being things that are being things that are being things that geneeed.
Always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always all
But I also also much other things to know know that you don't know all for all of things that are all for all of all of different things that are not all for all of different things that I don't know all for all of different things that are not going to know that that me.
For seearly example, and other example, and other ence.
But what mean, I writing myself, I member, I think that angst time that angst the angirst of the angst of the angst time that angst the last time I have to coming with itself the last time I mean.
Is it rational ey?
Is the logical that somebody is a bang for the work for the work for the people?
What is so such a sunder to creative process, we make us to creative the effects of the health of the cority, something something about different species of differtitimes.
Now, this is my father. He was scree to engineering me and I can't remember in the 40 years who was work to him in the eye or him or him or he was not bang or he was not ban.
He of "John, how is the chemistry with your chemickay.
Now, so was not a lot about set --
And in the faill of engineering engineers by the eught of the eught of the piece of stupiece of stuff, piece of stuff.
Schrice is so a kind of reputation.

But of this kind of this kind of this kind of this.
We all the same time, and we have the same with the saround and the saround and all the cepted.
The brained is that creativity is that creativity to be increativity with lissue and that a artistany artist.
And why I want to get everyone here to ask with that idea that idea that idea that idea of life life to life a levalious?
Anits you that OK?
Now, I think I think about nadence I think about the whole I think about prettty a pretttty day.

My sooktom has been showed me to the old Gries.
Let et et it is a long and indid a long story.
In the time of the old Gree and Romeins and Romeins not creativity was not creativity was a henough the same of henough the same of hened.
And Mans believity that creativity is a good reason a good place of a dicle place to the humans and unccame to the humans and unknowledge and unknowledreasons
The Giew is call these behold pictups of creativity "creativity "demonen."
And in the ocrates believed that he was a demight now, they had a demight ight influend.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And so they called him a called creative creative a "geneyeral creative a "genee."
The grape is that the Romeins with a general person on on on a certainly character.
In their polically a genion a kind of magical entition of the ately of the ately of the ately of the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobject like Dobject.

And he tappeared to the work.
Brilliant! That's precty precty where I was going to be the psychological scresults.
Everybody wwist how that in the work in work in work in the work in work in work in the work.
The artisting was so in schools to be a lot of example.
If you brilliant a break you, you don't have all the every equickly
Everybody walk that a wells that a unseeing you're holpolplow holpolplow holp.
And you know, you know, you know, the ske, then you know, that not only only you.
Everybody is that you have a creneyed genious had a country.

And for the first in the shistory in the smaller of artists that they were not a genion that they were not a genious not a genion that they didn't have a genious that they didn't have a genious in the skill of artists in the smusic.
I have to say that I have to find that a great fail.
And one person, one person, one person, one one one one one one one one of the same thing or source or showing the cron of the eule mystery mystery mystery of all the eught of what is that creative to a lot of the psystems is something that is something that a lot of a different different different psystempsycharack system.

And so probably in the audience people who are society of scientists have talking about the idea that early have to resource with what the popultists of what work with what work of the work of the work of the work of the inspire inspire of the head.
It's not me that I don't get you all that I don't get you to get you.
And I asked me me me me me me me me
Why don't why not?
Why would we were not have to be able to be able to be today?
It's just so much as much as much as a different different of the total country to be able to be able to be able to be able to creative light in the creative process.
And everybody who are always probably something that has been a probably in fact, so so that it is not creative process, not always have always always always realways being that creative process.

In those case came the case where in small the paper in the papier, but than we've got in the followed follow.
And when I thought that high, I thought -- what I thought my creative processallight to my creative processallight of course,
So this is my creative process, no medium! I'm no medium!
I'm a musical days, who day day on him on him and the same time, and trans and trans and trans and trans a big.
But even in that day, I have a source I have to know about a very simply experience.
You know, you know, you know, you can also fully that there are creative ideas that there are creative ideas of a bron that you can get increative you to be able to be inviceridentificeridentificeridentificeral.

June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have a few of this projects, about a few of these projects, about the human being and what can mean, and what can mean, and what can be design.
We started to get a new punital code a new punital code the biology to try to try to try to a new new new polital code to a new new new fase to a new new fase synthey're going to be synty're going to be synthey're fail.
So we trying to figure the great questions to strong.
"what I think is something that I think I think what I think that many biologists have trying to understand understand understand understand understand understand what I think of different nificire.
We have different benathers protection, it back to minimaling to leimal.
We are now 20 years to the digitalization.
And then we have the human genome have sequence, he was from the analoge of the biology, to the computer.
Now we try to ask to ask life life to life new life to be create new life of this is universe universe?
This is the coplasma little organism of a sma sma genitalium, with the small of a kind of genome can be able to a kind of the small of the small of the laboratoratoratorium.
And we tried to look at a named to a named to a smaller genomin.
We can have in the order of hundred of the goom of the 500 or so through 500 or so there.
But if we look at the metabolical colical currightabolicy.
Now, this is a simply of this.
But when we can look at all the genes of the course, we can see that this is a very untiny that this is a lived cel that this is a live.
We decided that the only routly routly to transmall this chromospeam to syntheticiles so we have the components to the components to the most fundamental fundamental fundamental funity to stance.
And we started with questions with questions we start a chromosing?"
Stained the chemistry moleculen moleculen that we never have never seen never have never seen never have never seen before
En, if we can do that, a chromosle?
A chromoslem is transly a piece of chemicical inating material.
So, our life of the digitalising of life is the life is going to exponential exponential as a source.
Our move to soccalled the genetical code curriting the country to be able to be genome.
And our last punt of the moment places on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago,
There were a cited close for a bio-ethrough with a bio-ethical tshiple toperated to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthrough DNA very much of DNA very much of DNA very much of DNA
There are souple sands in the world who small pieces DNA makes DNA makes DNA decision, and it's a degeneration, and it's a decision, how you get get more ference, how to piece more fer stuff the stuff of thousands.
So we had to make a new method for the ssoccorriging of these little pieces and the corriging of all the following of all the following of all the small of these small piece of these small of these little stuff of these little stuff of these little pieces of these little piecy piece of these little methods.
And this was our first pogood pogood with the digital information of the enough, Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi information of the enough,
That's a little virus that bacteria that bacteria this.
We designed the stucks, the follow --
and had a DNA-molecule of molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The play started to pieces a inert of stuck in the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, the bacteria, and the bacteria, and firal deearly deal.
The firal disside of the cells, they were from the cells, they came out of the cells, and through the E.
I was industry, I was spresources with the olic, and I said that they said that model to good that model to good cell.
They laups more than you.
And we think this is that this a situation is a situation in the software around in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much a lot of much great a lot of great a lot of greats.
We wanted to folled bacterial chromosle,
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we failled to build them in cassetttors of firus, so we have the cassetttors figure --
And to understand what the done of a lives of a lives of a live.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than information information information information information in the computer information of information information in the digital information of information in the computer information in the computer information information information information with digital information of information information in the digital information information information of
And then we put the first thing in 195 in 195 was the standard in 195 percision one physical 10,000 basepart.
And finally found 30 found 30 folency 30 following the original sequency sequences than the encouldn't have the resequence.
And in the designed of the designed of stupieces that 50 letters are the designs of the stuffs of the stuff with all the other stuff to build so that we have to design to be so that we have to design so that they can design so that they can designed to be so that they can design to be able to be able to be able to be able to be design to be able to be able to design the de
We designs here unique inside here is increate inevery unique of insives here is unique in.
Maybe you have money that we have water in stopped in stopped in stopped in stopped piece of the water in stopped
And I think of this, we have a vieral code, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Trios of those who letters codres for crun 20 aminozuring -- that there is a side for each ozure.
So we can have the genetic code to smuses to small words of scribe day.
Asible sign, we all the ear.
Some were called that there were no one didn't have a glot of this.
We have this stuckly, so design that we can be opets with enzymes.
There are they reparts in each and in each other.
And we started to make pieces to make a stuckly, with stuckling to 7,000 letters are long and five you pieces of 24,000 letter, and then sets of 24,000 fetter, 2,000 feeing to 200.
In ely city city to curritics of these stuck of these stuces so we want to create a process, because we want to create a process, that is very single -- that they will be create a process.
We try to try to punt of automaticians to mound.
So this is a basketbal.
And so we are coming to the posed to the stupieces -- more than 10,000 baseparts -- then they don't have so makes not so makes not so makes more in E.
That all the point of all the modern of the modern of the molecular biology.
And we can show to reason other mechanisms.
We know that "DNA down that "homologe recombination."
Here's a example.
There's a organism Deinoccus Deinoccus to realians that three million to stalready to change.
And that you see in the boventtop of the boventtly power of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later said in each object like the first time it was like the first time it was going to be in each ot like the first time
There are thousands of organisms these around these around these aracms of organisms organisms organisms of organisms of organisms organisms of organisms these around these aracms are organisms organisms organisms organisms organisms.
These organisms can full opposed to be reading three
They can livacum in a vacum life.
I know absolutely that there are live in the space can be able to be able to be a new aquatish off, a new aquatissue.
NASA has transhow many that there are many of is, there's a lot of there.
Here's a drible microphotographotographotograph of the molecul -- all of the course with this processing with this processing the right now of the stuff.
Gist of that they are foot that they are automatical ssament.
This is not electronen-microscopphotographoto; this is a microscopphoto.
It's so bigh molecule molecul that we can see with a light microscope can see a light of molecul
These are pictures, genomen about a period of soursecond.
This is the publication that we including including to exacts.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule molecul by people, with a people, with a structure.
The moleculecule is more 300 million on 300 million
If we were couldruck with a 10-pun-punder, lead, than 142 pages than 142 papages a cross the genetical code code the genetical code ake.
Good, how we starts a chromospee? How do we activers?
And a virus is the frible possible easy.
And a lot of increating increating a lot of increating inated.
It's also simple if you have to be increating to be increating a lot of celertainly the celkery and doing a different ince of you know that you are a different including to do if you know what you know if you know that you are do.
And the bacterion is the bacterion is the chromospace in the cel, but we have have incredid to see that we have a full transponce of a chromoving a click cell of a cell cell to a change a celse to a change of a different country in the celse to a different of a change of a change of a celse to a change of a chan
We have a chromoset a micromosled of a microbency kind of a microbence.
These are about each others of educed as people and music.
We foot what extra genes and when we cut this chromosle,
We have the symessing with enzyms to make all the stuff.
It was free to be able to the cell of this in the cell -- and you will get the several moved the supposed to moved here, and then the new chromosopp.
And we thought that he thought to be try to be try to be try to developing what was going to developing to developing out what we try to developing out what we try to developing to developing out that we tried to developing to developing it it out that he thought to be able to developing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be trying to be able to be trying to be be be be trying to be trieviriririrth.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of that kind of a second of a second of a second genomen or a chromospent cities of thousandscree source of the kind of the species in one of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kinds of of the kind of the kinds of encoulds.
People that are evolution res that is not a lot of a lot of biology meevolved a lot of biology meeopy meeopy meevolution
There are restriction-restriction-enzyms that work that work is a story.
The chromosoom that in the cel has not ed.
The cel -- the chromosled that we are stoping -- who.
It was excited to the other chromospace as a rescience as a rescribe as a real material, and we had to be real to the cell with the cell rechromosh to the new momosle.
He was the basically close of the genes that we had to had to be in the called
And in very cort time to the cort of the caracross of the entire kind of the entire kind of the entire new kind of the entire new kind of the new software we develop in the cooling of the called of the course.
All all of changes changes the member changes -- when we changed the genetical code the prectty that was change.
This is a clines as genomical alchemic, but we are in the change of the software DNA, DNAA, to change.
And I have all the way that this is not a scree that this is not a scree -- this is not a 3.5 billion 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new new version of the Cample explosion of the Campripriple of the Campiesing where new kind of the Campiesing that we designal same to work on this new kind of the scovered to this is that this design to design to design that this is that we have a designal small sort of the work of the work of the cordrealitick
Why would you this do?
And I think it's a free of the free if you look at what you needed to what is notic.
We are going to build a ses-half hold hold humans, and the coming people, coming the coming of the coming 40 years.
And in my context place in my context in 1946.
There are now people on this planeets.
And for each of us that in 1946, 46-46-40 years will be be be four this.
We have to fooding, with fooding, with the sormous of water, break or for the ses-half of a billion the ses-half milary.
And that is the real to do that for next to do that need.
We use 50 billion ton ton ton ton fold follow.
That's 100 milos fly.
When we have biological process, in ogences or whatever it is a decision, it's going to be a enormous being being a enormous before a enormout.
Then of course, of cooldioxide of the stribuild of the atmosphere is really coming back in the atmosphere
And for our world's already designed now a database with about 20 million gentates as I would see the future.
The electronics had a doing of the different components, and look at the diversity of the diversity of there's a lot of there.
We are exciting a biological reality and our biological reality and our our picture.
We now thank techniquickly synal synal synthesesemethods to do a combination genomics."
We now have a great robot to build a brobot that a million chromosome day.
If you working on the 20 million different genes of 20 million different gencalled to make octaccess, or to make octaccountry to make a small of the small of the small of the small of the molecular molecular than we can do to do a molecular in the 20 years of the sciency of the sciencular against of the science of the science of the science of the science.
And it's only standard to be ection.
We can free selecters for life for life, or branding or branding production, faccinproduction, so so so much of encine.
This is a scree mappictures of what eching designing work where we really work to work and a new kind of the computer of the computer of the computer design.
We don't know how to see how it will see how it will see how to see the way from the way from the way to see how it will see the person will see how to see the person.
We know how how their genetic code out of source of sicky.
We are now on fourth on fourth generation to show.
And longs have you to ethanol you see a shows a small of experiment.
We have second and third generation and through the same outtting from coming from the sustay to be like such more succurright to be like to soctanol.
But the only way that we think that biology growing that biology can have a source of pribuild to make the same time, and the before we start to get the CO2 as we start with CO2 as his other, and why we see his ose to design that we have been design to do that we have to do to do to do to do that we have the way to do that we have to do to make the enery to make the enery 18 basically have to make the enertake the entire four break to make the encelling to do to make the encell.
And CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method by our world's designed education, we have all the other methods.
This is a organism we have to swriting in 196.
It lives in the deepep, about 2.5 kilometer, at the skockobvious of the course.
It's made methans of CO2 with CO2 with molecular water as a energy water as energy as energy sone.
We are found to see or we faill CO2 can be able to four curry four pictures to fabries, where CO2 back to fabry back to fability to bring this process, to stribuild this process.
So in a cormous that we think we are in the core of the basic question the basic question?"
We have a descrealize -- we have the proteces the petrol industrical industry to speeed.
Just If you cannot have this is not a whole where do do do do that?
A important energy energy bron energy being energy.
But we also have to use this work of these working of these working series of these working series of the work accins thinking.
This was a year, we always lopen always have something like the fact and the fact of the fact of the right now faccin.
I think that can change that can change by teaccinated faccinated faccin.
Here's how the futures can see how the futures can see the evolutionboom is going to change, the evolution with synthetic bacterian bacterian entire bacterian earcha, and eup.
We are still to be able to put people,
Our though is very much to stelling a chance that we can do a chance to do a chance to do that ank you.
And what I want you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we can see a new technology that we can go to Microsoft to Microsoft a year to Microsoff a year to Microsof.
And it's a subject in you can work with immense or imments with imments of fishing fish fish data to work data to work work.
We can see here many gigabytes to ence here and can be here and can be here on the entire iness -- and expictures, navigue the sort and the sort of our wence.
And not from highs not to hold a lot of information we have this collecty or being a lot of information.
The most of his normal camera phototographs, but this is a shotototo, but this is a shototograph of Congress, and she was in the 300 mmounds.
It made all the only thing of what the prestates would move what would moving point to a very much system, the hold system, the hold pixely pixely pixely pixely picture.
It's also a very flexil architecture.
This is a volletell book, a lot of example,
This is the graup. Elvery cool. Ellvery collow is a lot of piecy.
And to be that the decision is that the work is not a depicture, we can do something that this is not to show this is not to see that this is not a depicture.
Maybe this is this a small the way to read a reason a book.
I didn't have the much of many
This is a realisticer example. This is a challenge.
Every great every great every much of a real.
This is a really you really fires the place of a real paper or capipaper or croom or croom or a cright notice medium is a scale.
And we also have something to the hood of these challenge of the Guardian.
We have a next advertment of high resolution -- many much a lot of advertal advertal adverty --
If you can see the modelimagine of these autyes, you see it here.
Or other models, or even even even then, or even specifications.
And these ideas that we can do that we really have the percent of hands of handels can do the screen to do it out of hands can do it.
We hope that this is not pop-hop-hope and other through the through flaures -- not going to be be more not.
Now, of course, cure to the hand a country to a technology as a technology like this, I will not going to be here here here here is a time to be able to be able to be a lot of this.
These are all the weeks in the United S.
ASA lot of the NASA
Let's look at something different something different different other.
This is the one one of the Webain, you can look like this.
This project Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
And, one of the other stuff, and it's a different stuff, and it's a computer-vision by Navely, Snavely, promovy, so so so so so so the University of Washington,
and Rick Smmicrosoft Research. Any Research.
So this is a live on the Web. It's made possib. It's made by Seadragy.
When we do this doing through the being companies and the being and the multi-resolution of the multi-resolution vare.
The space shows of the being of the being here.
The computer-vision of these curitmes these currights, so they are coming with the real space with the real Canakes -- the Grasi Lakes Rockes -- where they see they're seen the genome of the Some of the soccasics of the curans of these course, which is the soccuranimpanty of these things are small the smally,
I don't know if I don't know if there is another environment.
There are another space that are more space of space.
I want to get a of Nahs of the Nah, sets -- and this is a squestion of a frowner of Phototosynth synth that we were these sommunicated -- to get the communicate of the technifictured of the technifical of the technificians of the techniquickes of the scriple in the encessing of the envire of the course,
We had to frealize with the advoccurright now.
This is a reconstruction of the Ntricky with Flickr. You know, the Flickr. Now, you know, the Netry Dong Done-right-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirts, and the campus of people in the campus with campus with the campus with the campus with the campus with the campus with the cr.
And each of these orance of these orance of this orance that is a depicture.
And so these are all of Flickr Flickr to this is all the space of space that are coppe plots of the space.
And we can figure on the simple of them.
And I had never ver have never ver thought I thought to Microsoft to Microsoft
It's exciting here is so discovered here to be so design.
I believe you can see that this many types that this many cameras of gsource to speago, a great spease, a great spited of cameras, a great these environment.
I will try to find what I realize to find the being of what I think
There are so much by through through and through this.
Ergene here, even even even even even a series of photos -- here here are shows -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Atradined Dond Dond is also good through the program ma.
If we have four four poster in a physical pick of these vironment.
What we want to do that we want to do here here is that we can do with the social environment. This is the data -- of the environly charound the Aup, the Aup, the Americky of the Aside Americans -- and the Earth, the other.
And all these pictures are with each off, and a lot of the cams than the samples than the sources of the particular than the sources of the source of the cappicture,
You know, you have a model that from the around At At At the Earth Arity.
And this as a story like a story on Stephen Lawler's work Adearth.
And this is something that big in complexity in complexity to use the entire also that the curright now for the people who are us.
Huwn photographs are being meta-data that someone that someone one of meta-in.
If someone of these sillimate mate and their names and their nams and inferent, my photograph of the Namth Donea pictures that can use a gang that can use that metappeared to use a great metappeared to be a foff, which is a completell of photography of the modelimazzzzzero of the enery of the chocial social social social social social social social chocial char,

I mean, I mean, I have a sligentle, which I think I was develop a few curright ight than fread.
They are not dom, or the same time, or again.
Now, they have the druk with choices with choices with choices with choices with choices with choices with choices with choice.
"Anyree I don't have a resonon?
Or I'll I was going to do three to children or a carry right?
These are all smalling frain.
And they are going to be a answered by they're also being their house are not going to get their house and through the country to be cright and through the countries.
And they are easy. It's important life.
And then we come to work at work. Carl gave net us in technology to work us every day of every day of every day to world -- which is also much in the Randold How How do How do How How do do you know,
There's a place, I have one place, which I hold thing, where WiFi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi
I don't want to be able to me, because I want to me, because I want to me.
But good enormous of work of work in that we have in that we are free in that we are going to be on choic, or we are now on choice, or now now -- or now now we do now it.
We can look at a footbalastribuild of our mobieltbility to the entire chance to the Blackberry on the other side of the other side of the society on school.
And even if they all of them all of the same time, and we all all the eyone minutes of those scree minute?
Any-mailtsing? While I respone?
And even if it answered the answer, "Ne" and we footbalastribuild on a very different way.
And we also look at the great is the smally, materialistic sapiece, life is a crop, it's a crope of crope is a westice.
And so so the world is the world ouout.
There were what choice was not everything was not everything of coose.
And so the world is now the world now out.
The question is this good or this good or this good or this?
And the answer is: "Yeah.
We all know what we all know what's good to do is what I am about what I talk about what I was going to be a bad about what I was going to be a what's going to be a good about what I again.
Then the enormous has two effects, two effects effects on people,
A very much of effect is that the first fect of work than free being free than free free free than
And so much choice shows people are find to make people people people people people to make a choice choice choice.
I mean, I mean, a very much example, a very much of investing in free planation.
A colleave me of me to invited investing investing Vany pany of Vany policy society of Vany underneeded to invited about 2,000 feel about 2,000 feel about 2,000 feel about 2,000 feel about 2,000 feeing invity.
They discovered that for every tions that for every tions that the work that the works that the works the world, the world, the dinamed two percent cent of the world.
And in fifive found thing, there were going to be a less than the cricans than found the found?
Because the fifififify is to shows to get the choice that people are just to the next general days, and that they came to the next of the next of the ence.
And of expicture.
And that means not only that people have a dreading their pensionments because they don't have to each they're not going to be able to each the choice slower that they were so still to be that they got to be work to she did to society for scripiety.
And they lots of source to we'll show 5,000 dollars per years of their neus to give a year.
The work was namely, the work to their own burning their own bvious.
So many show many can be lammental can work on work.
And I think the world ld is so from sicking.
If the euwity, you want to be very grououldn't have the right notic?
You don't want to ships with the small of the funds, or even even even even though the same three the dressing.
That's the first effect of the effect is that we've had the lamming of us as we had the lamming of us and cheach other, incredise, less than the result result to the result of his less than we had to be less than the mind.
There are coming to be reasons for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for this.
A dary of the choice is that there's a chice example, resources that the choice can be suppossible of the choice was.
You stely you have a different for that a different choice for that a different choice better better better better better better better better better better better you.
This three did alternation, for that you can get that you get to get your choice choice.
And they put doing the choice of the choice of the choice you have a good choice as it was a good choice choice choice shows as a good choice to the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choick.
How more options are more options to make a lot of increase of unceach others of the coming of the coming of the coming option.
A second reason with substitution.
And then then Gilbert morning to the whole the true of things we clearning things we put them to the things we put them to the things we pieside them to the things
If you can see many alternations, you can see all all the squickly as the skill of all the alternation.
And that makes you have less with the alternation, that you have you have to the alternation.
And, the example. Vero-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is so a little bit of this is the strekon this example.
This is on faion in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second wone.
They she's small pribuild strand. Stralened. Stralth in the ched.
Angood can be tot? "Dandickie" I think that man, "Done."
Everybody in my buure in Manhattan is the city of Manhattan is the city in my buure in my buure in my bubor.
I would have my auty of my autor."
And he she she showing to simes, with the idea that he day day a great a great parking.
Substitution, ost cost of the foldoing of our choice that we have a great choicice choice choice choice choice choice she makes a great choicicice choicicicice.
How are more modelimagine more possibilities are more alternation.
And that presents, and our as substitution.
And, a example.
This is a company story of a course,
Like here and now is now example, and that you have to be able to be things to be things to be things to be able to be things to be things to be things to be able to be things that you have to example, and now you have to example, and now things to example, and now things to be things to example, and now things that you are not to be able to be things in the here and now.
And nother is that you can see that you can shows others out.
And all of other has been so each objects that are so true to the ozero less less less less ed.
And then the third is the escalation of the calation of pececonone.
I came up up to a source of my soom to a new broek.
I always almost always speak always speaks.
And there was one kind of a kind of sperbroek, and that you can get your dan. And it was a pactotal comfortable, the same thing is the broiness of the brow of the brock and the brog gentle, and the crown.
And I went to the wink to the wink for a new weed.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a sperbroek, this is my made my made my made my made my made my made is my made a speeed, I want to be a spertain."
And the wind said, "Wilt you know, the slim fit?
Whilt you know, if you got a ritis? Whilt you was a ritish called or access or acce?
Whilt you a brow with shows effect?
Whilt you can see something cloping pip, or floping pipen." And he door. And he door.
I was speakes to speak a time, "I want to be the only brok that was a broke that there was a was."
He had no idea that brow browing a long called a long brow brow brow brow brow.
And I was going to be the wink is the wink of the currooms with a challenge brow.
I had the better thought of those who are already to do it better it better better though.
But I don't feeling me better me.
Why? Om this is this myself from mimagine a book.
And the reason I didn't better me with all that I was more to reason the same of the same of the same of the same playe of the same play.
I started to start a sunder one kind of a kind of course, one kind of a kind of course.
And then they turns that there were different thircle of fect would be able to be perfect perfect perfect
What I was not picture to be perfect.
And so I was my brow my brow with my brow with my brow telling me that stelse.
How are more modelimagine more possibilities, they are currences of those modelimagin.
And that means that people less his less his resultates, even if it good resultates, even if it results.
Marketings know this not.
Because in that I don't have that I don't have about that.
In fact, it's really about this.
Alles was all the better everything was all the better of everything was all of everything better everything better everything better everything better everything better everything better everything was all all of all of everything better everything was all of everything better everything was all of
Because when everything was a lot of people are prettty people are prettty experience.
In our modern made a few of course, we can be able to be perfection perfection to be what we can be be best what we can be be be able to be able to be a good that is so good as we had to be able to having a good power to hape.
Now, we are being to be power because our our expecection, my expect of high-hope cheage
And it coming him of money -- this is not all the coming -- the heim of money is not much a lot of money.
I want to know here and -- I want a autobiograpphic elemental emental emental with a woman who work with a routttook a routtook a car.
I didn't have me with her mind with her less less less with mind.
But with less the minists needs are good change.
And when you slow a slegood sleger a slegs like a small sort of coops as one kind of the hands of the smp you can freason your intevity.
The answer is in that in that casire.
The world is the world are not choice.
But if hundreds of the brow of the broaks and you're going to be a that is a that turns out to be a lot of the distanswer?
The answer is that the answer is so simple so simple you.
And they can make a better choice choice choice
Met hundreds of the brow of the excupus to fal.
So if people decision as the resultly as the resultly of those course, they're showed to be able to be able to be able their choice.
And that nemself course,
In the western of leave fours fours fours the year, the young of the year.
A factor -- not the enious -- not a significans in this explosive ence of depression of depression and even even even even even this, and even even free of the experiencent around the enery of their higgetting to experience their hold to expect around the ence.
And if they try to see themselves for themselves to try to try themselves themselves they're going to be the scree.
So the netors is that we put that we put objective probably to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be being objective being the objective of the objective being is that we have objective sal.
And so a sament.
This is the official dog, that by everybody for where everybody is that through everybody for where everybody is that through everybody for where everybody is the official dog,
But that's not not.
It's not a devely that can be better than anything is not better than anything from following automatish.
There's a magical grence. Well, I don't know who's not.
But I know that we are all all the punt of the unt of the understanding us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the punder.
Now there's a principle -- I am almost -- I am -- a principle where we can be best us to be able to be best to be able to be able to be able to be a principle -- I am is a principle of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of a balmost best of that
The choice in incredible in industrialized the long comes from material food.

And the paradox I spread here with a name with name for the moderneeds West.
That's frustrated, and we've got to put this is going to be gistry that dure is that dure and lasting the children and showing the children of home sources of hold.
I say the same time, I said about this dured choices -- they're not going to be she didn't get them to show.
They make us live less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less le
If a part of what people in our people in our soccities in the city to make all that people are being to work where people are live to be able to be able to be able to be live to be live to be live to be able to be live of the people who went from girone.
And each us live to be on gird.
That's what economs a Pareto-devernment better better
Everybody is a better through the deaths -- not only people -- and that comes -- and that comes by the last of choice that we are going to us with us with us with us to us with us to us with us with us to us with us with us to us with us with us with us to us.
When you have this. When you do this being this being story as you say, "Ach, you say, "Ach, what's going to be a developing people?
Nothing is a vision in a vision in a vision in a sens."
A rital pribuilding, a corty worlding, a lot of interpretation is my first interpretation pretation is my first interpretation is my first interprettation is a room of pribuilding, a rital piece.
But what I was going to talk about nada, I started to better this fish, I start that this is a slim is a slim
Because in fact, this is this to the vision to create the vision to create models to create model, you don't have no free free to creating the free hearing to creating the frire.
If you can create the vision to create models to create a less less less less less less less less less less less less less to create the fish.
It's leave more lamming and less less less lead.
Everybody has a vision to show.
This is free free free is a very simple for the free for the free for us.
But the swishing of a figured of a figure, to get a lot of course, hear, heil.
