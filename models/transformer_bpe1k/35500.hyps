And I showed these two slight of the two slight that the last three million years to the last three million years to the size of the U.S.
But this is the most distribute of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disection of the ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global heart of climate system.
It put out in the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide I show is a very single version of what happened the last 25 years of the last 25 years of the last 25 years of the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened is a very single version of what the last slide.
The permanences is red-in red.
As you see, it looks like dark blued.
That's the yearal ice during the winter.
And the summs in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like flower, which is from the body's body here.
In 25 years is the from this to this called this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground the North Icelebrate and there a very big global warming frozen carbon dioff, when it designed by micro-frozen carbon microbes in methan.

A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtebronfly's Greenland from the north.

And last month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly quickly to the melt of the south islands.
The whole continent is for six feet of foot sea legal styles.
In the Himalaya, the on two after the largest ice massa, there are new now that were new now years ago, there were new years.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water from the melt time.
In the Andes, this gler is the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappears disappears the drinking water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It's coming in the water reservoires.

And the number of natures are strams of the world is stonly with an incredible and never seen fast,
Four times more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intential intention.
And if you look at the historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 in the last five years of CO2 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, and look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic drift in the oceans.
The only big causes of the warming of the Earth, next to design deforestation, which is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem and step is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extinction togethers, with China.
And there was a lot of more urbing carbon cool centers.
But we see a case of it.
These are the steps carbon that the building was the building was in the last year and where green alternatives were represented in the last carbon the years, and where green alternatives were represented in the last carbon the last carbon the last carbon the last carbon the last carbon the bond
There's a political stating on the country.
The steen carbon and oil industire gave industraight year, 250 million dollars to promots, which is a contesting carbon cleance.
And that image me about something like this.
Rond the Christest was in Tennessee, about four billion gallon, about four billion gallon gallon modder.
You have seen the news are in the news.
This is the one after a biggest of flowing in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the urban clelined the Kerst,
Video: "Frosty the voice carbon the sten carbon guy,
He's a ference of flow here in America, and he makes it makes our economy.
Frosty the voice carbon becomes with the day.
He's paid and cutble and cumber and critical and crabbits their job."
And here is a big part of the urban area of the urban carbon in West Virginia from them.
The biggest mine certainly is the big of Massey Coal.

We find clean is -- and it was clean, and it was still lead.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me just go on the over.
Video: Acurs: Schone steence, you've heard a lot of talk.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cutter.
Fantastic! The machines makes a little law.
But that's the sound of clean clean clean cutter.
And despite the fact that the fact that the fact that the burning causes of the warming causes of the Earth, change the earth, change the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the warming caus.

Al Gore: There's an old Africans talk that says, "If you want to be so.
If you want to go to and say, "
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am it. For those who didn't have the LHC is the most most of scientific experiment ever experiment in the surrounds.
It has to be the conditions needed that were less than a billion less than a billion second after the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition!
This is the machine of Gengine.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS, detector -- 44 feet in diameter the ATLAS, 22 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photo of ATLAS, in agriculture of ATLAS.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That made a party crazy in the controlle-cample room.
It's a picture of the first particle street that all the way around the LHC went around the LHC went out with a piece of the LHC, and pieces in the detector.
In other words, when we had this photograph that picture on 10 September that the machine worked, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest or this, or this, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a both of a cultural like a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behave.
These are the machines 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power to work.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small wear."
They can do that because they superceed in the whole low-temperaturs.
So at my-171 degrees of the space between the stars, who can draggle the stars, who are drags.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructivator.
And that was the wire of a black not, and there was a electrical result of the resistances that 13 thousand amper chedge.
This was the outcome.
This is another impressive when you realize that magnets more than 20 tons of the 20 tons of the tons and they were moving about 30 centimeters were moving in the same way of this.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them all tools.
Now they're back to away.
Eind moments the LHC will be intact.
We will put him again and expect it and expects in June or June or June we can further to further figure out what the buildings of the universe
Now, of course, who have increated incidents that starts debate the value of scientific research. It's easy to research a research.
And I think it's so hard that it's so hard, the fact that we go further than ever beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the decise of the words, I didure experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous than the such of the human mind than the progress than the human being than the human beings of the human beings are not completely that our images are completely definite our remember that our being completely definiteless that we don't complearning the designing our remove of the reve, and deft of the define of the res;
Thank you.
I would like to start with you to ask to you back to your childdhood and when you play with block with blocks playing block to block with block of you.
When you discovered how to understand how to understand and award award, you know, was a problems of learning with and learn from the declasses of space relationships.
Ruimts is a strong insight is a strong because with the world to understand us.
If a information of information -- I started by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advises with my advisitor Jevan Kalanithi -- I started to ask a computer -- I started to ask a computer of digital fingerial fingers of that entire moves of a digital fingeral fingeral fingerenced on a plate, which we can figure out with both information that we could put up with both information in a figur,
and orders as we want?
This question that we decided that we decided that we decided to search a ser of Siftables.
Sift is a Sift is a Sift a interactive computer in a size of a cookies.
They can be moving with the hand they can be moved to show them on the detect and they can detect a screen and they contact a screen contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded by graping blocks they can be moved by graduating to understand
And in the top of Siftables are a new ecosystem for manipulate of manipulate information.
And the way we have this resources a more physical difference, aware of their movement, and even of the way we have to move them and even of the way we move them and fun interactions of the new and fun interactions of the new and leak interactions of the resource.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is Sift is to show a video that play playing by cancering prevales and othershe's playing the back of the same back and played for the back of the show.
These interactive portraits of each other of consciousness.
And indicates each other, they will be interesting.
And when they get surrounded and they can realso fellow this and become a little nervous.
And they feel movement, and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequencing of the interaction of the interesting of everyday is a color as it was a fluid as a color as it was a fluid of liquid --
In this example three Siftables emmerces for a remarkable to use color in a leg to use color in a leg where they are getting together.
If we have drive to save some back and we threw some back.
There are some clear capable to the education, mainly gamely games, mainly game with languages and logics where we want to give things to the possibility that we want to give things things to be fast.
Here's the developing of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic shes.
Here's a game between Scrabble between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Sift-letter in every Siftable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary dictionary dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the very 30 seconds is the very rescued to a new series of letters with us,
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in to try to make it out and make a video of making it out a video of it.
They were actually away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people have almost no instructions.
Everything you have to say "Make word." And they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people to the test.
That's our young benefit of the right, right?
And it looks like Siftable,
For him was only blocks.
Here's an interactive painting showed an interactive painting
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language
This is Felix.
He can bring new characters in the scene bringing through the Sift with that character of the table.
Here's the sun coming up the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done be! Yeah!
And by the shams of Siftables and the next to shape the characters he can respond to each other, "We!
DM: and so his own story telling his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it walks down.
Video: The catairs.
DM: The last example I will show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music childdrop that we have developed recent a sound sound produces and drum.
One of four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use.
These sounds in empty Siftables are being injected so that you can detern the pattern of themselves.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a legal Sift live controlled of a legal effects like reverb and filter.
They are to a sound and added and addressed by cance.
And the general effects like tempo and full that are applied to the whole pattern
Let's look at the time.
Video: DM: We start with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern of a pattern by an extra lead.
Now I place the basline here.
Video: DM: I feed a little bit slaggled to it.
Video: There's now I can buy the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can I can call the way by the office of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I put the filter to the filter to the filter of the expression.
Video: DM: I can repay the pattern of the play.
So I don't have to represent, but I can improvise and I can improvise it a very longer and made care like I want.
And the endly, the dims of the demms of the volume Sift to the sift so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people's making new people, and my passion of new people, which are voted to the way our brain and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with a new element of possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is only the refers is just to a very new generation to interact with digital media, which is the information to the information to our world as we want.
And I thank you from heart.
I look at it to come with you.
I'm writing away.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am all of writing and I don't think that will change that ever will change that will change it.
And yet there is a recently something in my life and career, and career, and career, which I would have my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work again.
And it started with a book I written until I've written a memoire, "Eten, Biddy, Biddy, that very contraveler work and an international excition was the whole world and an international excited the entire world and an international excition.
The result is that people now and always have to be pull as if I did me and always put down in the ways of the time.
And so, in the poly:
People come to me and ask ask to me and ask sure you'll never afraid to be succeed?
Don't you read your whole life will be write to write you'll have a book more a book that people will be write where people will be walking for warm to be walking for warm to be write you?
If you don't you get there?"
Story reasoning, you know you.
Of course, that would be very much more -- I remember that I was 20 years ago, I was a tener -- I was going to be a teenager.
People said, "Don't you never get success?
Don't you go afraid for it. You will go on through it.
Don't you afraid you live to this work without of this work without that there is something from the public and you will deaths on the public of broken dreams of your bittern-fail?"
Something in that stretch.
In the short comes to this questions of questions of this questions of this: "Ja."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called the things that are being end.
Always the whole of that.
But I'm also much other things that are very much other things that all you want to know what to all of it.
For seawe, for instance, and other ends.
But what is writing writing to the last time I made the last time that fear of fear.
Is it rational?
Is it logically anyone is to be afraid to be scared to the work for the work for the work of the work that they put on Earth of the work that they are put on Earth of the work that they are region their earth that they are region their work on earth that they are reason their opinion to their opinion the earth
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of them in the effects of the minds, something that is not happened to work in the mind of the work of the work of the work of the effects that we make us to make the effects of them as other.
Take my father. He was a chify engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he was working on him or he didn't have a bit for a bit for 40 years afraid to him in the 40 years.
And so said, "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been through the centuries of the eters of the reputation of manical depresses for manical alcoholists.
Schrright, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation human being.
Look at the grimy death the most magnificant creative minds the most magnificant creating of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own own own own through own own own through own own own own own through own own own own them.
And even those of them who are not suicide of the suicide understand understand them.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of a bit of the types of the same out.
We all heard and have heard and have it all before all accepted with a bit of accepted and they have accepted it.
The thought is that creativity is that creativity of unlocation, and that a piece of artist, and that a artist, and that will lead to the artist,
So I want everybody to ask everybody here today, can you with that idea of life?
Did you have that OK?
I think I agree about it, I think I agree in the way I don't think of prettti-thought thought of thought
I love it reference.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century this century.
We can creative mind creative minds a lot better to live and life.
And I sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to the dark of the minute of the minute of the minute.
Seme, the phase where my career in which my career now is now in.
OK, I'm young, I'm young, amper of a year.
I can be able to do through decade through decade
Hught probably will I'm going to publish through the outside world as the work that followed in that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can slow you -- and I can probably solid my biggest success, my biggest success,
Yes, what a idea!
And if you go think, you're going to be like you know the morning to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me walking with the work that I love with the work where I love
The question is, "Did Do Do Do Do Do Do "Hoes
After long I think I'm going to conclusion I can only go by writing with writing by writing a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a safe distance, and I have to realize the response and my overcome very understanding of the response to my future publications.
I did it last year, I looked at ways, to ways.
I am in the history and have deplots and have deplots of civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My question has been brained with the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let up because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greek and Roman and Roman and Roman believed people didn't creativity of themselves.
And people believed that creativity was a divitable, who was a fairly unknowledge place to the human being came individe, to the couple reasons.
The Greeks called these basically basically of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon who was a demon that he had a demoon that he influence.
The Roman had a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of the idea.
And as a called a "geniused creative mind a "genius."
The Roman is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their political was a geniused a kind of magical entities that are opped in the walls of the artist.
A bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work was working away the genius was assistance.
And he shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I talked about the earlier that I talked about the results of the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artist, was so in protection to for example, to reverse to be much narcism.
If you were brilliant to brilliant there.
Everybody knew that you had a unseen, which you had hold.
Word you have crack up and then that don't layers only you lay to you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genius.
Long time is that the Wests creativity.
Then came the Renaissance, and everything changed
There's a very new idea: the individual human individual human is the resources of the universe and mysteries.
No room for mystical creatures, reflect from the dival world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity, that creativity came from the individual constantly
And for the first time in history was about artists of artists were saying a genius, and they didn't have a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big mistake.
To one, one person, one individual individual individual is the field of the century, the source of the century of the century of everything is dive, of everything is to be a lot of responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks you to smart the sun of smart.
Egos are blowing up to giant proportions and there are unimagine proportions and there are unimagine experienced to exprestations to exprestations to experience.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years many artists capot.
And if that is, and I think, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back the older of the relationship between the humans and creative mystery and creative mystery and creative mystery?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of spech.
Probably sat the audience people who have reflected required of the idea that elput in the idea that elphysical pooder the work of artists of artists to inspire inspire the work of artists to inspire the high-inspiring high-like the public ress.
It doesn't seem to be to me that I will get you to get in there.
And I am ask I wonder it.
Why not?
Why do we didn't we have that thought that thought that thought
The same as much as much as much as all other explanations of the total incomputational incomputability that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has been trying to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know the creative process here -- you know the creative process of the creative process of the individual.
That it sometimes to feel like almost paranoral.
I have a lot of the wonderful American closer Ruth Stone meet meet Ruth Stone meet meet
She's in the nined. Her whole life writes they're close.
She told me about her right on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field, she heard a poem on the country.
It was so said that she said, along a big golf came air.
And so close of golf than about the land to her on the land to her
She felt that the ground under her feed under her feeling and knew that her on that point to do one thing to do is just one thing to do is stonly one thing for her life.
She from home, back through the poem and she had to be able to show up and package.
When the poem through her came through her was that her only chance to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then round, but run, it doesn't reached the house
And in such moments of her high school close by her -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different directly.
And I think there were a lot of the story -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they have the poem of the story -- they have almost mistake.
And then she was in home looking for and paper and poem the poem through her through her it.
Juist that moment she had a pencily together.
And with her other hand, she plucket me she poeded the air.
She picked up the global and she pulled back in her body, as she wrote the writing.
In that cases came the poem well-wonderful in subjects, but then in a lot of paper and came up in the case order.
When I heard that I thought -- what happens to be exploited my creative process.
That's my creative process is my creative process.
I'm a mile, which every day on the same time, and every day and sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood, and trans out with blood.
But even in that day swindow I have been swritical experience.
You can also know that you can also know that there are creative ideas in your board that creative ideas in your course coming out of a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that for source?
How can we use the without without we are being come?
At a way that we have good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can be musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way about this.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been showed the shown, the showed of the same thing that is going to try to get all the power of the review of the incontect initive impults that indive in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of swell.
And one day he reference in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed the process.
And as he was there so heard that he heard a fragmental of a melods.
The decided him like inspiration that fields, unregrounds, unred understand
It was a beautiful global and he wanted to the hold of the fasth.
But that went down.
He didn't had a paper -- no pieces of paper and he had no piece.
The wonderful exciting exciting exciting excited to him the melody and then it stays me the melody of the familiar back and then it turns out of the familiar back and then the melods.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it.
He didn't real in panic, but he stopped that whole process and did something news.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry hear, I don't see that I behind the wheel?"
"Think you now that I can be able to write a song of the write of this?
And if you really want to get that this song is going to be later, you have to reflect for you.
That's not going to be able to fall of a difficult fall in the way.
Ga neighborhoods of Leonard Cohent." And from that currently different.
The work is the same thing, with the same thing, with the familiar subtoon.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him critical process in him when he distanced the genius.
The geniused to close the skin and liver skin and liver it was a bit of course.
Tom realized that there was no realized to go through it.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre society of a conversation between Tom and the own aspect that was not quite at all.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a lot of them --
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle.
And I so, a give moment I am in despair.
You know that well, you want to work and you don't want to be good and you think it's a terrible disast. The bad book.
Not just just the bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad.
I wanted to call the project all of the project of the project of the project of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that I was called Tom that and I decided to way.
I wish from my manuscriticians and I focus and focus to a room of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all of the way that if this is not just brilliant to brilliant is, that not just by me.
You can see I have all of the things I have.
More I can't give it.
And if you find that it have to come better you, you have to do your thing you.
Do you don't have any of that, right?
I just write down, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notults are going to be disappeared that you are a today."
Tja--- United it comes here,
Eured came up in the North African desert people together to dance in the North African desert music.
Urs and hours and hours to the morning,
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes a very real real happened.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean with that, you know, you know, you have to have a performance in a performer.
It was like the time silenced and the dancing and the dancing through a pace step.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights for it, but now everything together.
He suddenly seemed to a human being one.
In him, under him glourished him.
A fired fired through him.
And if you did a happened, people knew people who were started to clap and calling in charge and calling in charge and calling in charge, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the Moren South historical fact, while the Moren South South South Spanside Spanside of the south, they were going to be able to be able to put this wonder with them.
The equivalent is by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other."
That you hear today in fighting fighting and flages and flamengodns.

Redwinds, souldn't have a glimpse of God.
Pecions what we need to have to do it.
Lastig is that the dancing morning the following morning to the day was discovered that he dince day to dince 11 hours in the morning.
And at that point is that moment he is going to be a little older man with designs that maybe never more to be able to be able to be able to such more of the decise hight.
Maybe never more anybody will never reference his during during his dance.
What to he now have to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to squares for a creative mind.

Do just your work.
Don't do you do this, what it is.

If the dival geniused to decision to decision to decate in your work at enyway, then leave by the wonderful source, then "Olle.
There's not, dance through this.
And also says, "Ole !"
I believe that harted.
"Ole !" anyway, because we put out of pure human love and ownnership by remaining the pure of human lows.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovered from genes.
We start from a new point of point, we were the biology of the digitalize of the digitalize and now we try to go from the digital code and we try to go to a new phabits of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" I think is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different levels of level.
We tried different approach to minimum the back to minimum components.
We're now going to the digitize of the digitization.
When we have sequenced, the human genome sequenced, it went from the analog the world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for raining life rain, can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a that can be multiply in a laboratory in a laboratory of oratory.
And we have tried to look at a non-smaller genome can come to a non-smaller genome.
We can go out of the hundred of the 500 or or or anythrow of the 500 or that are there are there are there are are.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively compared relatively with the one.
Believe me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at per piece of the genes that we can probably revided a life cell that would be a living cell cell that would be a living cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that we can produce a living ce.
We decided that the only route prevalue was to synthetic to synthetic this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started questions with questions as we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetimess?"
And the chemistry the chemistry is to make these very large molecules that we never see.
And, if we can do that, a chromosome 'ran called "?
A chromosome of chemical industry is a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is acce: exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code, but is a lot of slowly slowly --
And our last point would be in this moment would places on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical tool-ethical tools in the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be very difficult.
There's tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, so how longer you make the piece of the piece of them are there are more mistakes there are more mistakes are more of them.
So we had to put a new method of the together of these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes and corrating all the mistakes of all the mistakes and corrate.
And this was our first power to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the fold correction --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting started to piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria of the genetic code and viral particles --
The viral particles were leaving the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and dead the E. coli.
I was unclearned with the oil industry, and I said that they were model but to all that model already snapping that model just too good snaking.
They laughts more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software the software true in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could varie.
to go to understand what the real regular components of a living cell.
The design is critical information and when you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very very much accurave.
When we first put this genome in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a mistaker 10,000 baseparates.
And finally we resequenced after resequencing 30 mistakes the original sequence was not to start in the original sequence.
And part of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build a smaller smaller to design so they can design so they can design so that they can design so that they can design as together.
We designing here unique unique in the bottom.
Maybe you have read to have read water merice we have in stop.
There's a this: we have a four, we have a four, A, C, Go's and T.
Trios of those letters are code for roughout 20 aminose -- that there is a resemultiply for any amino-source.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words.
And then we call ""We're just a mile.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no poems were not close.
We have these pieces so designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repair and put in each other.
And we started pieces of course, starting with pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long, pieces that were five to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000.
In every stage, we cut a flow of these pieces of pieces so we could sequence, because we want to create a process that is very robust be very robust -- that will be very robust be very robust -- that will be very robust show you that could be very road.
We try to reach the point of automated to reach the point of automated
So this looks like a basketbal.
And once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 10,000 baseparates -- then they don't grow easy more in E. coli.
That is the exploit of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
That's why we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologist, which is used by the biology to repair the biology to repair the biology to repair that pieces together.
Here's one example of the course.
There's an organism called Deinocococococococococococcus rad three million rad to raid three million rad to raid three million rad Deinococococococcus radiodurance to the same three million rad Deinococococcus rad three million called Deinococcus radi
And you see that in the upper panel, so, she just clear, so,
12 hours later 24 later he put it back in each other, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dried.
They can be in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in the space of space, that can be provide a new aquatical environment.
NASA has showed that there is a lot of them,
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with the right design of the pieces where we design in the pieces that we design in the design of the pieces where we dept in the floor of the molecule that we did in the design of the molecule that we
Gist makes that they automatically concerned automatically
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish we involved in.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule by people, with a clear-clear, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is over 300 million of together.
If we would press the pressured with a 10-points letter, without spations, there is 142 pages pages only to pressured the genetic code away to pressure.
Good, how do we start a chromospsome of the chromospher?
With a virus is the clearly easy.
With a bacterium is the much complicated.
It's also simpler if you put under eukaryots, like we just whether you just whether you have the cell and does another in, and that's what you know if it's clong, and that's what you know if it's clone.
At the bacteria of the bacterial integrated in the cell in the cel, but we have showed a complete transplant that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome of a cell to another, and the can activate the cell of a cell and activate the cell of a cell integrateful in the cel, and we can
We have a chromosome of a microbs of a microbs of a microber species.
These are about as far from each other, as far and mice as people and mice.
We figured some extra genes so that we could have to be able to be selecting to select the chromosome of the population.
We have the reason with enzymes to make all the edge of the edits.
It was quite sensational when we stopped this in the cell -- and you will put the very advanced graphic images here, you can make the very real chromosome of the cell.
And we thought that he would come to square of the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of them or three of thousands of properties that they have thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution to represents like there is one of the results of biology have a lot of biology community to be a lot of biology that is not much biology have to change a lot of biology that evolution evolution to change a lot of biology that evolution evolution to the evolution that is not a lot of biology that is not much as if there are one of biology biology that is not much as if there is a lot of biologice.
There's enzymes restriction enzymes that restriction are actually enzymes DNA
The chromosome that in the cell has not every one.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped in -- well,
It was expression, and the other chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the new chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the c
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared of the characteristics of one species and changed completely in the new species, and he changed on the new software that we stopped in the cell software that we stop.
All of the proteins changed the membrans -- when we change the genetic codepended up the genetic coded was changed.
This is a masounds like genomical chemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental --
And I have been continue that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is not a new species of evolution, and I have paid that we may be able to be a new version of the Cambloic explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the new species of the digital design on this digital design on this digital design --
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what it is to take a little bit of what we need is.
We're going to go from a six-and-half to nine billion people, during the coming 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There's three people on this planets.
for every one of us that in 1946, in 1946, that will be four years.
We have a lot of food, with cleans of clean water, medicine, fuel billion drugs for the six-end-billion drugs.
That's hard to do that.
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the momena to replace that to replace that out, then that will be a huge challenge.
Then there is a natural of the cool dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
And though our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had been a dozen a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the electronics.
We are pretty constrained by a biological reality and imagination.
We have a technique ship rate of synthesia to called combination genomics."
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes or resources of genes or to optimize the processes to make octan, new vaccines, new vaccines, new vaccins, we can change more molecular biology to change more molecular than science.
And it's only standard of the selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen mafield of what real design design software where we work on the core that you can really go to the computer and design a new kind of the real design of the real design of the real design of the real design of the real design of the real design of the real of the design imagination of the real design of the real design of the real design of the design of the real of the design of the computer that we can design design desig
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We now focus on fourth generation.
And you have seen your grand ethanol of ethanol of the bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come from in, which will come from in, as sugar, to more higher fuels like sugar, as a different species like octan, or different species like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology to have biology without the food price without the food price and the available of the food substance, and we think that we have the first food substances that we can design the first food generation that way, and we think we can burning the first fired generation of fuel inside of 18 months of food.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered -- we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea -- about 2.5 miles away, at cooking him in the deep,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We can take a look if we can take CO2 we can take care of easily foot through pipelines where CO2 is being the fabried to fabried this process.
So in a short of time, we think we are able to break out of the basic question: What is life?"
We have real, you know -- the providing purposed to the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, what?
A important energy source becomes
But we also now work on these tools to use these tools to reflect rape of vaccines to remember series of vaccines to the fast,
This year was the flu was the flu -- we just just just behind the facts of the flu vaccine.
I think that can change through the tested vaccine.
And here you see how the future can go out of the future of evolution tree is going to change the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria, archeaed, archea, archeaeds,
We are more removed from the improve of people.
Our goal is certainly to imagine a chance to survive long enough to survive that maybe you may be able to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we at a Microsoft of a new technology that we have been a year ago.
And it's a environment where you local or on the distancy of immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at this here many gigabytes of digital images and can see, and can see, and exciting out there and the sort of course, and the sort of sort of terms and the sort of course.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the large of these collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library or Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixal.
It all doesn't matter anything because the only thing would be influence, on a subject in a system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image of data.
This is the graute home by Dickens. Every colum is a chapter.
To evidence that it's actually text text is and not imagine, we can do something like this is really text to show that this is really not imagination.
Maybe this is a bit strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't recomment.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a particular part.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capacity, which is actually a scale medium is a scale medium of a real medium is a scale medium is a real medium.
We also have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nept advertising of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra information information information information information information -- and we have extra information of a normal advertist -- and we have extra nept of advertist of a normal advertence.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the constrains of actions of across the screence.
We hope this is not a population more means and other thing, and other flaure.
Of course, of course, for the hand maps for a technology like this, I will not spend time to spend a technology as this, I will spend a lot of time we can contribute this field in this field of a lot of course,
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And then the pictured of the NASA --
Now let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can see it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snahington, promove, so on the University of Washington, incredibly by Steve Seitz on Steve Seitz on Steve Seitz on Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz on the University of them is a very beautiful piece of them of them of the University of them by Steve of them to the University p
and Rick Sseliski in Microsoft Research. A beautiful contination.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution resolution resolution resolution resolution to it.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been brained with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadese Rockies in the Canadese Rockies -- where they are taken -- where they are genome of stabilized diashws or panorama and panorama and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is a whole time there is a little environment.
There are much more space there are much space more space.
I want to take one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth, and this is from Photosynthing, and this is the communicate of the communicate of the environments on our website.
We had to reflect with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames from Flickr. You just just just just Now Damazing in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and subject and subject and subject and submed image.
And every of these orange looking at the image of the picture that part of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model in the model of this model of model of this model of model of this orange in the model of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the every single of this orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the every single of the reagain the
And so this is all of Flickr images, which are in this way space in this way.
And we can close simple way.
I had never thought I would have thought I would ever work at Microsoft of Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so designing here.
I believe that this is a many typice of cameras are cameras are all of mirroras, a big number of them, a big number of them,
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much more covered by factions and such the similar.
There's a set of photos -- they're a series of photos -- here's them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dele-Deed-chained, by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of how we can see the Earth -- and copping the Earth -- and copping it all the other.
All these pictures are going to be connecting together, and shapes a very larger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
That as a result on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use, and also the benefits of the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being supply of metaphorn.
When somebody would want to be access, and they would like to be able to reference, my photograph of the Notre Day, and I can take a common that data, and I can use this metaph, and I create access of everybody else and create a lot of cross-modal, and create a kind of cros-modal, and create a kind of cros-experience.
And of course, the mease-product of this immense rich fellow model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from air, who are not just from air, satellite images and other applicative mes and other application, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes your software possible, in the next years, all the images that are defined by everybody can crace on the world together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates to your wish wish between images.
And the pictures of the data in the images.
And that is designing when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of semantic information that many of these images.
When you look for the web page of the web page of the pictures, you figure out and the text on the web page of the piece page of what the image of the image of the image of the image of the image.
What if now that image is to all your image is to all your imagination?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of the unfairly distantic comes out of the battle. It's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible incredible incredible incredibly incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incrediled.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and eating of eating and research the ability to live the old of them that are not forget to forgetting the old of the ancient street in the wind, the profitters in references, the probably policists in bitters of the ream in bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still revill of the Milky Way, or that the myths of Involves of Invene with the Himalaya boodhist of the Dharma, or that in the Himalaya breathm of the Dharma, you remember the world is really drive in the anthropology in which we live in a absolute of the world in which we live in a absolute of the world is not to be absolute of the work of the work of the working of the world in the anthing.
the result of a vallightly set of a view set of course, we remembered our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same tack require ed: Words. Brents in the world.
We all put introducation rhythrites.
And so, with the individed of the distinction by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dancing and art them.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that is to the Penan in the walk on Borneo, or the Voo-And, or the Voo-boly in the Kaisut of the Caraisut-born, the Caravant of the Caravanced in the Andes-based or the Caravanserai in the heart of the Caravanced by the whether I requence, a month,
Everest, the godin-mother mother of the world.
They all learn us all of us can be thinking different, differently, differently.
And if you think about it, you can just give this idea is just give you hope.
Shapes the intelable cultures in the world's intelable cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet and cultural living in biological life web -- the biosphere.
This cultural life-web you can imagine as a class of eating a cutter.
The eath fact you can definient the define of all the second of all the seconds, dreams, ideas and intuitions, ideas that are inspirations that are consciously intuitions that are the beginning of our consciousness.
The cruster is the great nalatency of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we can be and we can be amazing as amazing curious curious curious species.
like the biosphere is the eater is the eath is the eath fact that -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist that would take half of all the species of extinction of all the species of extinction that is not true.
And the right that the most apocalyptic scenario comes in the neighborhood comes in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this.
And then everybody here was born born, there were six-thousand languages.
A language is more than her words, or her grammatic rules.
A language is a certain cape of the human soul.
It's the ferency of the view of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century mind walking, a discontinue a discontinue to spiritual possibility.
From that sixth thousand languages today the day of the children in children fluists in children fluistated in children of the time.
They are not longer to learned babies of it.
Effective means that they have a change of change that they have been dead.
Is there something like to be a little bit of silency by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to have the wisdom of the children or the promises of the children to have to be the children tested to see the children test?
Peither that is someone in the lock state every two weeks of the every two weeks of the earth, because every two weeks of the last letter-ms of the old language of an old language of an old language of an old language
Some of you say, "Well, the world won't be better place if we all the the world are speak?" I said, "Super, let's take Kantone.
Or Kogi." You will realize your realize how it would not be your own language language
So what I really want to do is to take you today is taking you on a short journey of the eat, who have to sketches a little bit of what in fact,
And many of us from us that when I talk about a different of being a different, I also really mean to be very other ways.
For example, this Barasana-child in the North Amazon the anaconda, the anaconda, that believe that they flowing out of the anaconda, from the east of the east of sacred sking, from the sacred of sacred skdown.
This is a people, that cognitive the colors blue and green underestablish and green is the wonderful of the skulling of the off.
They have a called a bit of swell-marriage rule, which is called you to somebody in the linguistic example, you have to say, you have to married another language of that.
This is a roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary fulling in their home, where six or seven languages, by these crases, but you never heard a language of humans, but you never heard a language of through them.
They simply simply and start speaking and start speaking.
One of the fascinated tribes that I have reflected the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuadorani felt was contact in 1958 perfectly was contact was reflected to be contact
In 1957 five missionariss, and they made a critical fault, but they made a critical fault.
And the air of the air they photographs of themselves with the idea's friendly built that this is a friendly second-secondition of themselves.
They were talking about the photographs and tried the form behind the form behind the face behind the face behind the form behind the photographs and tried the form behind the photographs and the shape the photographs and tried the shape the photos and the shape the form behind the form behind the form behind of the face behind the form behind the face.
When they didn't found anything they found that the divel of them with this.
But the Waorani doesn't just outside outside stated, but also each other.

To sensational things that can understand what to understand learn to learn about this particularly belief, which is not a cult of black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical world-image, very interesting.
Would I ask you the big worldreligions of the worldreligions, what would you say you?
Christiand, islam, boodhism --
One continent is always outside of the touch that Africa was reflecting the Sahara didn't believe the Sahara didn't believe the Sahara did no religious of believe.
Voodo is simply the destillaate of this device of destroyed ideas, in the tragical diaspora in the tragical diaspora in the tragical diaspora in the slavery.
What foodoo is so interesting is the living and the living and deaths.
The living booms the minds.
The mind can be references under the Great Water, answer the souldn't be the soul of the living time, so that during the soul of the living time, so that during the following is the god.
That's why food-food-bows say, "You go to the church, and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you're so involved by the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a multiple of show you in trance that follows in trance that flowing charges in trance that flowing coals.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the questions I decided that I did a book a book of deployed
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also such a little bit of surprising that you may be mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the Westerest, industrialized society.
And that official dogma dogma as follows like this, to get the highest level, we have to get them as much as much as possible level, we have to give them as much individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good good, a essential part of the human exist.
And freedom is freedom to reach us to act a higher insight, to reach a higher profound increase without of the best of this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would take to during a deep of during during in our society.
And in our life is this dogma dogma bit of business.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A resource.
Two about dressing.
And in the next 175 can-encountry in my supermarket dress in my supermarket virgin extra-virgin extra-virgin foil and different different balsos.
And you can make a number of the dressings own dressings for the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the policy of my supermarket.
Look at electronics, you can reference. You can replicate your stereoset of games, cassetal pier, cassetespecier, cassettespecially incered.
And if you can choose the electronics, you can choose out of this number.
You can see six-and-half million different systems together with the subject of that store.
Give towards -- you have a lot of time.
And, again, a different example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could read all kinds of phone services but only at Ma Bell.
You don't reflect it to be bought it out.
That had been the benefit was never destributed the device of the before
That time.
And now there are a lot of different state.
And the diversity is the diversity is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with musher leger and crer crer and crer crer and crer crer and crer crer and crer critical brandone.
Wellight has not seen this model in the wink, but you can certain of its that happens that happens.
The consequence, people come to the wink and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the question that question?
No.

And in aspects of life that are much more important than the concerned of stuff that are more important of choices of choices of choices are a few of choices of choices that are much more important than the attack of the conceptional spullends of the stuff that are much more important than the conceptional of the things that are much more important than the concernore of the resulference of life that are more important than the contantly important than the more important to be more important than the major of the resickes than the resick of
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the United States that you go to the doctor, and tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do And, we can do that, or we can do it.
As has this pretty and nadels.
And what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, what do you find up?"
And the doctor, "Apieces and the corn, and the capture has this favase.
What do you want to do that?"
And you say, "Doctter, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call that we call "own inbring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means the heavy of decision of decision of decision of somebody with message -- to a doctor -- to a seemed and not the best condition to results -- the patiently to resource decisions -- the patient. For patient. For patient.
Good consider sleep that nersleep, because the goal, you can't buy it.
Why we can't buy them, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we go to the following tomorrow to ask our doctors to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity, yet a referency aspect of us exist, is now considered to choices, as you can see on this slights.
Our identity is standing of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to leave ons.
Every morning to the excite of what you want to be thinking what for person to be able to be thinking what to be you want to be able to be thinking for person to be thinking what you want to be able to be thinking what to person you.
Let's talk about the marriage of marriage,
There's a time that fair that fair that fail everybody from that you can possible, and then you can confidence, and then they can be possible, and then quickly as possible to children start.
The only real choice was with whether and what you did and what you did did.
Now is freedom, everything for the room for the operate.
I give lesson that I give lesson intelligent students, I remember, I remember.
They're not dominating the heads of early time.
No, they have the pressured with choices.
"Well, I say or not? Well, I marrie?
Or I will I wait? Take I first first children, or a care?"
These are all being questions.
They are going through to them, also if this means they don't get all their homework and they don't get all their homework and done by no good number of them.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just gave that technology to work on every minute that technology to work every minute world -- except in the world, except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place I love secret secret where WiFi the does.
I don't realm because I want to love that place for myself.
But good, that enormous choice of work in that we are going to be asking us to ask on the time, or we're going to work on or not.
We can look at a footbalwiddle of our son one, with our song, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and we may laptop on school.
And even if they all out of standing out of the state, are we all all of the continue of the competition with all kinds of questions: "Well, I responsible responsible of this phone currency of the responsible of the top, "Well, I ask this phone --
And I am on this emailt respond? And I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is experience we experienced the football competition of our son a very different way.
Where we look at the big, the grandandful, the small, materialist things, lifestyle, lifestyle, life is a question of chooss.
That's how the world early saw the world earning out.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world is now looking at the world now
The question is nowing or bad or bad or bad.
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what we all know about is good to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
That enormous choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on the humans.
A very contraffice effect is that the paralyzed before learning than companies.
And with so many choice possibilities people to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investigation in freedom, a research for investments in freedom.
A colleague of me access to investment investment data from Vanguard, a big policy society of a single declass of 2,000 employees of 2,000 stigations.
She found that for every decided that for every tions that worked the work gets that the work gets the work gets of two percent declassive percent of the debath two percent of the departy of the depended that the work of the deft polite of the defishing fundred that the debt of the debated, the defound that is defairly degre
Fifty fundred 10 percent less employees are less working less than five fundress. Why?
Because it in fifty fundred to choose the people just tribute that people the choice to the next day, and that people have the next day, and so on.
And of extended to the core of the obviously comes from the outside.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensioner in their pensioner to eat because they haven't enough money they have been referenough money that the choice of the choice that they have been working in the work of history.
And they walk with a 5,000 dollars a year on their nose for 5,000 dollars a year on their nose
The worker was reaching was reaching to double, to double.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice can work on the freedom of the choice can work a lot of choice many choice can work a lot of choice much choice can work a lot of choice much choice can work on freedom freedom.
And I think the world is looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right to make the right of the choice makes right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong with the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did the lowing of us and choose the paralyzing, and eventually choose less tevily with the result of the result of the result of the case would be less options as we had less the less of the result of us as we had less the ded effect.
There's more reasons for that.
And a of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the dressings, back that the choice was not perfect perfect.
You represent you in this case for that another choice would have been better.
This is driewed alternative alternative to you,
And speaking of the choice of the choice of the choice that you have made you've made a good choice.
The more options are more option. And so there is to easier to have regardled to have regardled of the geckodd.
A second reason has to do with substitution cost
Dan Gilbert gave from the tomorrow we learn the value of things we leave the things we leave them from the things we equalivalue to compared them with the things we learn from the value of the things we leave the value of the things we leave them all the value of the things we leave them.
If you can invite many alternatives you can see all the attractive cants of all the alternatives that you discuss you dedicate.
That makes you have less text with the alternative that you have chose to have the alternative that you have chose
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a bit of the stretched the streak of this example.
This is a pick in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second live.
They sit on a wonderful beautiful beach. No human.
Don't be able to that? "For you can't do that?
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city out.
I could flater my car, for the door,
And he is there two weeks there with the idea that he was every day that he was every day again, maybe a wonderful parking of walk.
Substitute cost of the entire of the entire we going to have from our choice we have from our choice to be making a great choice of the entire choice of the engineering of the entire choices that we have to have from the fairly choices of the engineering cost of the entice.
The more possibilities are more possible alternatives there are more possible alternatives.
And those presentation is to us as substitution cost
One example.
This image of pictures to some points.
For example, and now in the here, and you don't have to take things to be hated.
And one thing is that you have a point of the choices of other choices.
And all that other has been so attractive cans, which is the chose that the geckoses becomes less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expeciations.
I came up with this in my search for a new brow.
I always smoke away to brow.
Well, it was only one kind of speeger brow, and that bought you know, the past, it was incredibly uncomfortable to the browd, but if you were the browdge, and often the broad of the OK.
And after years I went to the wink for a new one.
And I said, "Dag, I want to say, "Dag, I want to do a be."
And the store said, "Wilt you figure fit, easy fit or relaxed to relaxed to relaxed to fit in a fit of relaxed fit or relaxed to be a smart of smart fit or relaxed easy fit or relaxed to fit --
Do you know if you have a rhyth? Do you know stone-washed?
Do you have a bit with slight with slight?
You know, you whether you walk out or flating pipipeline." And so he went on the pipeline.
I was speaking a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to go the only brows earlier.
He didn't had any idea that was and so I have a long time and so I have a long all the possible brows of pass.
And I mean, I left the wink and I left the wink with a bit of passing pass pass of pass passing pass of a bit of passing passing pass of the wink and I left the wink and I left the wink and I left the
I had better done it better of these possibilities I could do it.
But I don't felt me better.
Why? To do this to myself, I've written a book.
The reason I didn't feel better of all this choice was that I started more of a good speaking more good speaking of a good speek.
I started without any expection, because I just knew --
And then turned out there were different and one of them would be a field perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a lot with my browing with my expectation, and that put me to my purpossible tell.
The more possibilities have more opportunities of expectations of the resting of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevile with results, even if the good results are good results are good results of them.
Marketingly don't know this one.
Because in that case I don't know what I'm talking about.
In the real is going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was bad of people could have experttive experience.
In our modern society of course, we can expect as well-various shape of expection, but the best thing we can we ever had to be so good as we had as good as we had to do it.
Never before we are surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torentor,
The secret of happiness -- this is what you're all coming -- the secret of happiness.
I want to imagine -- I want to take a carry biographic elemental -- I am with a woman who really fantastic fantastic element.
I didn't have me with her with less text.
But with less enough his good office.
And finally, why you can sit a bad sit bad speak to break if you buy one of them is only one kind of a primary one of them and wonderful you to ask why you're unteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible of you, you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broaks available and you buy a that turns out to fall the time, who is that they responsible to be responsible of different busines?
The answer is just as simple. That's as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows you don't have excus.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions of those decisions are good to be good for their choice.
And they remember, they they're reference.
In the Western society squares clinical depression under the young generations of the young generations of the young generations.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression and self-myself-my-suical experiences are of the experiences of their high experiences.
And if they try to explaining the teleuration for themselves the description of themselves.
So the netoresulate is that we are objective on the bad of thing, but our bad of bad of thing, but our bad of bad of this.
And a society.
This is the official dogma, which is that by everybody for everybody.
But that's not the same thing.
It doesn't seem check better than can't choose better than can't choice, but it doesn't follows more choice that is more choice better.
There's a magical borders of choice.
But I know that we have been prevailing for the point that choice for choice of us well.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best of the best thing we can keep the best of the best of the best of that we can keep us the best of the best thing we can like the best of the best of the best thing we can like the best of the best of the best --
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material flows from material flow.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem is not so much choice is too much choice that there is a lot of choice is to be a few choice is to be a lot of choice that is too much choice is not so much more choices to the world, where we have heard to be much more of the plac
So the paradox I was true with a fadox for the modern I was wonderful, wonderful.
That's frustrating and this is frustrating and Steve Levitt has told that expensive and difficult to installing children.
I say the same thing about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help it. Erger -- they didn't help them damage -- they did damage
They make us live less our lives.
And as a part of what people people in our society of societies of all these choices were behaving to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put on the five of those people in the prevent of the people in the society of the people in society of the society of the people in our soc
And our life would go on the prevent of it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-in-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful, not just poor people -- and that comes through the last of choice that we measure with us.
And finally, if you read this image of imagine and read this imagine humans say, "Ah, what do you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a fishing come."
A writing imagination, a short-upon global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it is a better I started better that this fish.
Because in fact, this is what you do is to create the fish, you don't have the fish, you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom, but paralyzing freedom.
If you get the visue of the fish to create possibilities, you get less text less text to be less the business of business to create the fissue.
It leads to more paralyzing and less teving.
Everybody has a fish of fish.
This is a free certainly -- it is to concerned for us.
But the absence of a figured of a figured to ask corn, unsquare, unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
