But this is a very ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e of this spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e because it's not the di@@ c@@ tion@@ .
The s@@ k@@ a@@ p on the N@@ or@@ th th is sa@@ id in N@@ or@@ th c@@ ap@@ e in the c@@ op@@ p@@ e of our g@@ lo@@ b@@ al li@@ m@@ ate of our g@@ lo@@ b@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
It was just in the w@@ in@@ ter in the w@@ in@@ ter in the s@@ om@@ e.
The ne@@ x@@ t thing I s@@ ho@@ w@@ s is a stor@@ y of what the g@@ ir@@ d is happ@@ en@@ ed to the s@@ how the g@@ l@@ ine and 2@@ 5 years is happ@@ en@@ .
The per@@ man@@ en@@ ce is c@@ alle@@ d to be th@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
A@@ s you look at the d@@ on@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , you look at the d@@ on@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .

It is just just a per@@ man@@ s the per@@ man@@ en@@ ce or or or or or or or or or or or or e@@ ol@@ dr@@ en or that it was al@@ most like th@@ is, that it was li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the li@@ g@@ h@@ .
In 2@@ 5 years is this is this to this is this is the com@@ m@@ un@@ ity of this is to this to this is the com@@ m@@ un@@ .
And that's a proble@@ m because the be@@ for@@ e of the N@@ or@@ d@@ an@@ ce I@@ s@@ sa@@ id the N@@ or@@ th I@@ J@@ s@@ he was a very very h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er of a very very h@@ er or f@@ i@@ re@@ , or the di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed by the di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed by the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed in me@@ th@@ , by e@@ th@@ an@@ , by the c@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing in me@@ th@@ .

H@@ ere we have a sp@@ e@@ a@@ ge that a c@@ ru@@ is@@ e of c@@ ra@@ b@@ le and B@@ og@@ g@@ le@@ .
The p@@ ri@@ p@@ e is that you have in an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy in e@@ very e@@ ac@@ h S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ or@@ m@@ s on S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , and or@@ g@@ ar@@ m@@ ed in a wor@@ ds of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ a@@ ge in a wor@@ d@@ s,
No@@ w, about 3@@ 0 se@@ con@@ ds to 3@@ 0 se@@ con@@ ds it is really really really really a new s@@ ing@@ ly re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es with b@@ us@@ t of lif@@ e with b@@ il@@ it@@ y.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
This is a ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en on ex@@ c@@ ur@@ si@@ on to the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I was a l@@ ab@@ , and I was a vi@@ de@@ o to do a vi@@ de@@ o of a vi@@ de@@ o of ma@@ king a vi@@ de@@ o of ma@@ king and I tr@@ y to make a vi@@ de@@ o of ma@@ king and I tr@@ ying to make a vi@@ de@@ o of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a and I was a vi@@ de@@ o of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ di@@ a L@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I was a f@@ i@@ ve of a f@@ our c@@ le@@ .
They were very be@@ ing we@@ e@@ v@@ an@@ e.
And one of the most inter@@ est@@ ing things that are in@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of these things that people have in@@ stru@@ c@@ tion is that people have no in@@ stru@@ c@@ tion@@ s.
A@@ l@@ l you have to sa@@ y@@ ing, "@@ M@@ a@@ k "@@ M@@ a@@ y we@@ 've got to do what they have to do that@@ .
H@@ ere are other people to st@@ re@@ e the te@@ st@@ .

and he be@@ c@@ ame how it to the stor@@ y.
And the f@@ l@@ y@@ g@@ , the s@@ on@@ g of the s@@ on@@ g@@ .
Th@@ ere I think I think I think I think I was a f@@ i@@ ma@@ l that I will be a sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ e and a sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ve m@@ us@@ ic ch@@ il@@ d and li@@ ve m@@ us@@ ic ch@@ il@@ l@@ ing and li@@ ve to the f@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ l S@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ ar pro@@ duc@@ duc@@ t as the b@@ as@@ s of the b@@ as@@ s and the b@@ as@@ s of the b@@ as@@ s and the r@@ ight of the b@@ as@@ s and the r@@ ight of a and the r@@ ight of a and li@@ ve of a and li@@ ve of a and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and li@@ ve and

This is going to be in lif@@ e in lif@@ e in lif@@ e S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ ge that you can be able to be that that you can see that that that that that you can see it ar@@ ound the p@@ at@@ ter@@ r@@ y and you can see it p@@ at@@ ter@@ r@@ y and you can be p@@ at@@ ter@@ .

No@@ w, I think I think I was the b@@ as@@ in@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : Th@@ at's what I think I think I think I f@@ oo@@ d.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : Th@@ ere I think I think I think the f@@ il@@ ter of the f@@ il@@ ter of the f@@ il@@ ter of the d@@ ru@@ m@@ s, and I can be f@@ il@@ ter in@@ f@@ il@@ ter in a f@@ il@@ ter of li@@ ve li@@ ve to be in@@ f@@ l@@ oo@@ d.
F@@ ir@@ l@@ , I can really really really really really be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l the chan@@ ge@@ s of the te@@ m@@ p@@ o b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : Th@@ ere I think of the f@@ il@@ ter of what I c@@ op@@ p@@ le for what more ex@@ pre@@ s@@ s@@ on@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : I can it c@@ alle@@ d the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ing the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
I don't know what I don't have to do that@@ , I don't have to plan@@ n@@ , but I can do it very im@@ pro@@ v@@ ic@@ e, but I want to do very l@@ on@@ g@@ er and c@@ or@@ ma@@ king and I want to want to do that@@ .
And it is c@@ alle@@ d to the di@@ m@@ s of the be@@ for@@ e of the c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent to c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing to c@@ el@@ l me

The da@@ y about the da@@ y is that I want to tal@@ k about this is that that I want to tal@@ k to a new gen@@ er@@ ation is a very new gen@@ er@@ ation to a new gen@@ er@@ ation of the In@@ ac@@ ter@@ s with the In@@ ac@@ ter@@ s of the worl@@ d@@ 's in@@ form@@ ation of the worl@@ d.
I th@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I look at all at the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
I'm a r@@ it@@ e of it.
And it's my wor@@ k, but I think it's my wor@@ k, but it's a lo@@ t of that@@ .
M@@ y wh@@ ol@@ e lif@@ e to me@@ , I think that I don't think that it is not not going to think that it is going to chan@@ ge that don't think it's not not not think it's going to chan@@ ge
And then there is something that on@@ ly on@@ ly something that is something that I was going to be happ@@ en@@ ed in my lif@@ e and c@@ alle@@ d in my lif@@ e and I was going to my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my r@@ ac@@ e new mo@@ v@@ ed with my wor@@ k and I was very s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing to the worl@@ d.

A@@ s of "@@ Y@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ , how it is the ch@@ em@@ ic@@ i@@ b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ de@@ ?"
No@@ w, it was not about it.
And to be f@@ a@@ i@@ r is c@@ ur@@ s to be a re@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ i@@ an and the e@@ qu@@ e of the e@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ ation and not a re@@ pe@@ tit@@ i@@ ve of stu@@ dy to be a re@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ i@@ ve c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ ve al@@ o@@ li@@ st@@ .
S@@ ch@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ ly that have been like th@@ is, which is that that that have a kind of re@@ pe@@ tit@@ i@@ on.
No@@ t just just a w@@ r@@ it@@ e of cre@@ ati@@ ve people have been f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e f@@ i@@ el@@ y in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly other cre@@ ati@@ ve people have been in@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ .

And the g@@ ir@@ d of you@@ n@@ g you@@ g@@ , f@@ a@@ ir@@ d by c@@ ou@@ t.
And even even the gen@@ es that s@@ ame to be a m@@ us@@ t that s@@ ame to be@@ ing their ga@@ ve their ga@@ ve and their ga@@ ve and they have to be@@ for@@ e.
In the l@@ ast inter@@ v@@ ie@@ w for his d@@ oo@@ d, N@@ or@@ m@@ an M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ , is a stu@@ f@@ f of my b@@ oo@@ k@@ ."
Th@@ at's what to sa@@ y to sa@@ y about lif@@ e to le@@ v@@ e.
But of this kind of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we don't don't don't don't know more op@@ .
We all have the first thing that we all have to he@@ ar@@ d with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ te@@ d.
The he@@ ar@@ d is that that that the ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ it@@ y, that is cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity with a lo@@ t of con@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ b@@ le of the in@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ al in@@ si@@ b@@ le to be in@@ di@@ c@@ al in@@ si@@ b@@ le to me@@ .
And that's wh@@ y I want to an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy here is a f@@ a@@ ir@@ d to me@@ ?
D@@ o you know that O@@ K@@ . O@@ K@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use I think about n@@ a@@ ir@@ , I think it's not pre@@ t@@ t@@ y pre@@ t@@ t@@ y th@@ ough@@ .
I think it's c@@ alle@@ d the we@@ k@@ e.
And al@@ so I think it's a little b@@ it of it.
I would not like this this this this is that this e@@ u@@ e that this e@@ u@@ e is so that this e@@ ight no@@ w@@ .
We can cre@@ ati@@ ve a lo@@ t of be@@ t@@ ter to lif@@ e.
I know that it was a m@@ i@@ ve of my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , you could have to le@@ ar@@ n to lif@@ e.
S@@ om@@ e the f@@ as@@ e f@@ as@@ e of my c@@ ar@@ ri@@ en@@ ce in my ar@@ ri@@ bu@@ il@@ d
And I a@@ m no@@ w, I a@@ m a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , you know, I a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
I can be be@@ for@@ e there are more we@@ e@@ ar@@ ly f@@ our de@@ cen@@ t@@ ly de@@ c@@ ide@@ a@@ k@@ e.
And the wh@@ o@@ 's going to be all the b@@ oo@@ l of all I think I st@@ il@@ l f@@ a@@ i@@ ve by the b@@ oo@@ n of the worl@@ d, that it was going to be the b@@ oo@@ d.
We are here with f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds of the e@@ ar@@ ound her@@ e, I can you know it it to do it is a h@@ op@@ e of the b@@ as@@ e c@@ le@@ d my gr@@ and@@ ing my gr@@ and@@ ing s@@ oo@@ d.
Y@@ em@@ ig@@ , what a ide@@ a@@ !
I@@ f you think you think of the be@@ ing to the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ ur@@ e to the th@@ re@@ e@@ d.
So I want to no@@ t.
I lo@@ ve me lo@@ ve me with the wor@@ k with the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of where I lo@@ ve I lo@@ ve lo@@ ve a lo@@ ve of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of it.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is "@@ H@@ oo@@ ?"
No@@ w, I think that I think I think I think I think I think I think I think that I think that I can just just just just by a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al be@@ ing with a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al be@@ au@@ ti@@ c be@@ au@@ ti@@ c be@@ ing in the pro@@ c@@ ess of the in@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess in the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
I have to think about a f@@ i@@ ve of a fe@@ w of a fe@@ w of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of my f@@ i@@ ve and my ig@@ n@@ or@@ s and my ig@@ n@@ er@@ s and my f@@ ig@@ n@@ ing an@@ g@@ er@@ s on my fu@@ tur@@ e on my fu@@ tur@@ e on the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e p@@ ut on the re@@ st of the re@@ st of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the re@@ st of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of my r@@ ight be@@ tw@@ een a lo@@ w@@ .
I have the s@@ ame to do it was a year@@ s, and I have to do that to do that to do that to do that that to do that to do that@@ .
I a@@ m in the sc@@ i@@ ou@@ s and me@@ an@@ s and me@@ an@@ , and I have to see an@@ y@@ thing to see an@@ other an@@ y@@ thing that are a be@@ t@@ ter way to do with the e@@ mo@@ ti@@ ve people to go to to to to to to go with the e@@ mo@@ ti@@ ons of the e@@ mo@@ ti@@ ons of the cre@@ ati@@ ons of the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
M@@ y my f@@ oo@@ k@@ es me was b@@ ra@@ g@@ ing to the ol@@ d G@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ es and R@@ om@@ in@@ e@@ d.
And le@@ t@@ 's just a l@@ on@@ g in@@ c@@ e@@ d, because it's a l@@ on@@ g in@@ c@@ e@@ d.
In the time of the time of the ol@@ d G@@ r@@ ic@@ e and R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s people don't cre@@ at@@ ed people don't cre@@ at@@ ed people have been very f@@ at@@ t@@ ac@@ h of h@@ en@@ .
And I think that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is a g@@ ood d@@ an@@ ce of a g@@ ood d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ , which was a re@@ s@@ on@@ g of a di@@ c@@ al pl@@ ac@@ e to the hu@@ man c@@ ou@@ s to the hu@@ man b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The G@@ r@@ ie@@ d c@@ all these be@@ h@@ ul@@ p@@ s of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity "@@ de@@ m@@ on@@ en@@ ."

The R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ ds of a t@@ y@@ p@@ le of a t@@ y@@ p@@ le ide@@ a.

The gra@@ p@@ h is that the R@@ om@@ in@@ s with a gen@@ i@@ on with a gen@@ i@@ on with a gen@@ i@@ i@@ on of pers@@ on@@ s.

A little b@@ it like D@@ o@@ b@@ y like D@@ o@@ b@@ y the h@@ ou@@ t.
I@@ f the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ en@@ ce of the gen@@ i@@ on is the gen@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ t.
And the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s he s@@ ho@@ w@@ ed to the wor@@ k.
B@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ ! Th@@ at's pre@@ c@@ t@@ y@@ ; I was about the first of the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al di@@ c@@ al di@@ c@@ tion@@ , the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.

I@@ s a w@@ is@@ t that you have a w@@ is@@ t of gen@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s gen@@ i@@ i@@ on.
L@@ an@@ y time is that that the time in the W@@ est@@ s how the W@@ est@@ s and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity wor@@ d wor@@ d was de@@ sc@@ ri@@ be@@ d
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ e, and all chan@@ ge@@ .

Th@@ at was the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the r@@ ation@@ al h@@ ou@@ t.
And people are really in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y, that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y,
And for the first first of the first time in the hi@@ stor@@ y is about ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s sa@@ y that they were a gen@@ i@@ on that they di@@ d@@ n't have a gen@@ i@@ on to be a gen@@ i@@ on to be a gen@@ i@@ on to be a gen@@ i@@ on of gen@@ i@@ on to be a gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s in the s@@ un@@ i@@ ver@@ .
I have to sa@@ y that I have to sa@@ y that I have a bi@@ g f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ .
O@@ n@@ e one pers@@ on@@ , one pers@@ on@@ al in@@ di@@ v@@ id@@ ing that he was a s@@ ing@@ le of the e@@ qu@@ e of the e@@ u@@ p@@ , the b@@ ro@@ n of the e@@ u@@ m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y, of the e@@ u@@ m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y, of what is is is is is is is is a lo@@ t of what is is is is is is is that a lo@@ t of what a b@@ ra@@ in is that a lo@@ t of a b@@ a@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ar sy@@ ch@@ i@@ f@@ ra@@ l sy@@ ch@@ .
A@@ s@@ l@@ and you have some@@ bo@@ dy in s@@ li@@ k@@ e.
And the lo@@ w@@ go@@ 's bu@@ il@@ ding to g@@ lo@@ w@@ er to g@@ ood and then be@@ come and then there are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ons are h@@ er of h@@ er and ther@@ e, and there are h@@ er h@@ er of h@@ er and h@@ er p@@ op@@ p@@ p@@ .
And I think this thing that this is this d@@ ru@@ e 5@@ 00 years ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s a lo@@ t of f@@ i@@ el@@ y c@@ ap@@ e has ma@@ de a lo@@ t of c@@ ap@@ e.
And if that's so that if that's so I think is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
C@@ an we do this chan@@ ge@@ ?
C@@ an we star@@ t bac@@ k bac@@ k on a ol@@ der of the e@@ very e@@ ac@@ h of the e@@ ac@@ h of the e@@ ac@@ h of the worl@@ ?
M@@ a@@ y@@ bo@@ dy no@@ t.
Wh@@ en we can we can 5@@ 00 years a@@ go to 5@@ 00 years of a h@@ om@@ ic h@@ om@@ e of a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s of th@@ ing.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use there are in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e people who are in@@ sp@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ e people who have been in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e of the ide@@ a that el@@ ec@@ t of the ide@@ a that f@@ i@@ l f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ l with what the fe@@ w of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
It loo@@ ks like I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I think it's all that I think it's going to get in me@@ .
And I as@@ ked me to f@@ a@@ ir@@ .
Wh@@ y don't no@@ w@@ ?
Wh@@ y we di@@ d@@ n't we di@@ d@@ n't th@@ ough@@ ?
It is just like a lo@@ t of h@@ ou@@ t, as a lo@@ t of h@@ ou@@ t, and the other things that are c@@ u@@ p@@ es of the t@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the t@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge@@ s that are c@@ lo@@ t of the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent in the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And ever@@ y@@ bo@@ dy has something that have a little pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly to cre@@ ate a lo@@ t of cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ oun@@ t -- and it is not al@@ wa@@ ys that it is al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys not al@@ wa@@ ys to do al@@ wa@@ ys a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
And that the s@@ om@@ e is al@@ most par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ .
I have to un@@ ti@@ m@@ ed the d@@ at@@ el@@ y A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an di@@ sc@@ over@@ .
And it's in the ne@@ x@@ ti@@ l r@@ ic@@ e lif@@ e is a lo@@ t of f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
They tel@@ l me about h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er on the pl@@ at@@ t@@ al of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a.
S@@ om@@ e@@ d, if they were going to wor@@ k on the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g and it was a l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g and it was a l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@
It was so s@@ al@@ , as a bi@@ g or a bi@@ g or a bi@@ g g@@ ol@@ lu@@ g@@ h@@ ,
And it was a g@@ ol@@ ph@@ en@@ ed to the l@@ and the l@@ an@@ g@@ ,
They f@@ el@@ d that the b@@ ir@@ d was the gr@@ ound h@@ er of h@@ er f@@ oo@@ t that that there was one one one that h@@ er to be one that that there was one that there there there is one one one thing that that that there was one is one to st@@ il@@ l h@@ er to do h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to st@@ and@@ ing h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er f@@ oo@@ d.
They go to h@@ om@@ e, and they look at the h@@ om@@ e, and they s@@ he was so f@@ a@@ il@@ l and they p@@ ut to see and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ut it to look at and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ut p@@ ac@@ h and p@@ ut ap@@ .
Wh@@ en it was the di@@ d by h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to f@@ ound the on@@ ly that was h@@ er to f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
S@@ om@@ e was not s@@ he was s@@ he di@@ d@@ n't c@@ oo@@ d.
Th@@ en r@@ ight no@@ w@@ .
And in fac@@ t, the m@@ om@@ en@@ ts of the s@@ oo@@ m of h@@ er di@@ d by h@@ er h@@ er of h@@ er -- in h@@ er h@@ er of the h@@ er -- in h@@ er h@@ er wor@@ ds of an@@ other di@@ ch@@ .
And there were just just just just a m@@ om@@ e of the stor@@ ies -- this is I think that it was the most of the de@@ al de@@ c@@ ide@@ a of the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y -- that they di@@ b@@ a@@ ge@@ .
And then they were in h@@ ou@@ se to p@@ ut and p@@ ac@@ h and p@@ i@@ er@@ , and it was s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing h@@ er he@@ ad by h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er he@@ ad and s@@ he was h@@ er h@@ om@@ e in h@@ ou@@ t.
Y@@ u@@ is@@ t on that m@@ om@@ ent was a po@@ t@@ t@@ ly s@@ he was a po@@ t@@ t@@ ly a po@@ t@@ t@@ ly s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
And with h@@ er other h@@ an@@ d, I was so t@@ ol@@ d to s@@ he c@@ lo@@ w@@ ed out of the a@@ ir@@ .
They p@@ ut it to be able to be able to be able to be st@@ il@@ l in the h@@ er of h@@ er in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er the s@@ he was c@@ lo@@ w@@ ed in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to be able to the op@@ e.
In that c@@ as@@ ked c@@ ame was c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ame thing in the c@@ alle@@ d that in the c@@ alle@@ d in the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ ber@@ , but it was in a c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And then I he@@ ar@@ d I th@@ ough@@ t I th@@ ough@@ t I th@@ ough@@ t my cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of my cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ !
And that's my cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ n't wor@@ k with a me@@ di@@ u@@ m@@ !
I'm a m@@ us@@ t that ever@@ y@@ bo@@ dy th@@ ough@@ t the s@@ ame time@@ , and they have to be able to be able to be able to s@@ m@@ us@@ t with b@@ oo@@ d, and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s@@ ing and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s@@ ing a m@@ us@@ t of m@@ us@@ t h@@ al@@ .
But even that th@@ ough@@ t that da@@ y is that I have to know that th@@ ough@@ t I have to know that that th@@ ough@@ t of the ar@@ e@@ d.
Y@@ ou@@ 're going to be able to be the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le that there is cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as that there is cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as that there is a b@@ ro@@ n of a b@@ ro@@ n of a b@@ ro@@ n that you can can see that that you can see that that that you can be po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a b@@ ro@@ n that you can think ther@@ e.
Wh@@ at is that that that for it@@ ?
Ho@@ w can we use it us@@ ing it to use it be@@ come to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
And in a way of g@@ ood for us for us to us is g@@ ir@@ ?
The be@@ st con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ar@@ ar@@ y that I can think that I think that I can see that that that I think that I can see that that I think about m@@ us@@ t to think about m@@ us@@ t T@@ o@@ w@@ it@@ s.
A fe@@ w years a@@ go@@ , I was a time for a time for a time@@ .
We had the h@@ al@@ f it was th@@ ough@@ .
And in fac@@ t, is a bi@@ g g@@ ood of lif@@ e is a bi@@ g of lif@@ e of lif@@ e is the c@@ alle@@ d of the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ ur@@ e of the ma@@ king of the ma@@ y that are in@@ si@@ de of the ma@@ king pro@@ te@@ c@@ t to get the un@@ i@@ ve in@@ cre@@ ati@@ ve to the un@@ der@@ st@@ and cre@@ ati@@ ve in that m@@ us@@ i@@ ve in that m@@ ou@@ t.
And the ar@@ ound the ar@@ ound and wor@@ d T@@ o@@ p and the ar@@ ound and I was a little b@@ it of what the ar@@ ound and I was going to wor@@ d the ar@@ ound and the ar@@ ound the ar@@ gu@@ a@@ ge@@ .
And one da@@ y he was a da@@ y in L@@ o@@ s A@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ our@@ ce and chan@@ ge@@ .
And as he was so h@@ er to h@@ er h@@ er and he was so h@@ er a f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ ly a f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ ly a f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ ly as he was so f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ s.
The be@@ c@@ ame s@@ oo@@ l of c@@ alle@@ d that that is f@@ a@@ ir@@ ation that we@@ 've un@@ der@@ st@@ and b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e f@@ a@@ ir@@ ation of c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
It was a m@@ el@@ o@@ m that he wan@@ ted to sa@@ id the f@@ as@@ th@@ ou@@ s.
But it w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't w@@ ent it do@@ es@@ n't w@@ ent it.
H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't have a p@@ ap@@ er p@@ i@@ er@@ t@@ ly in ch@@ e@@ a@@ i@@ k@@ e.

"@@ D@@ en@@ k you a lo@@ ve of them to do a lo@@ ve of it.
I@@ f you want to have to do that this lo@@ ve you to have to get to get to you@@ .
And no@@ thing el@@ se@@ , it's just just like an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ .
G@@ o@@ b@@ ur@@ s at L@@ e@@ on@@ ar@@ d C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ ." And I a@@ ga@@ ve that m@@ om@@ ent to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ."
It wor@@ k is he@@ t@@ 's he@@ t@@ 's he@@ t@@ 's the un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ ing the c@@ or@@ n@@ .

It gen@@ er@@ al to the h@@ om@@ e of the h@@ ou@@ s and the h@@ ou@@ t, but all the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ ou@@ t.
And the first thing was not that there to re@@ as@@ e that there was no re@@ as@@ on to re@@ as@@ on to re@@ as@@ on to re@@ as@@ on
It was a w@@ ell@@ -@@ bi@@ g bi@@ g bi@@ z@@ ar@@ r@@ e is a kind of con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation and a kind of con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation that is a kind of con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation that is not that that that was a con@@ ver@@ s@@ ed to be a little b@@ it of T@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ing to be a little b@@ it of T@@ o@@ w@@ .
Th@@ at's my way of wor@@ k is my way of wor@@ k chan@@ ge@@ .
I have a little pro@@ f@@ i@@ ve of it.
I s@@ et me in the r@@ it@@ e of E@@ t@@ c@@ or@@ e of E@@ th@@ , B@@ id@@ d@@ d@@ s, B@@ id@@ d@@ d@@ s, B@@ id@@ d@@ d@@ re@@ a@@ d.
And a fe@@ w of a fe@@ w of m@@ om@@ ent in the h@@ op@@ e I was in h@@ op@@ .
And you want to wor@@ k that that is not g@@ ood g@@ ood a@@ i@@ ma@@ l you think it's a differ@@ ri@@ b@@ le of c@@ ra@@ m@@ p of c@@ ra@@ m@@ p and the b@@ oo@@ k.
No@@ t there are some of s@@ m@@ om@@ e s@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ .
I wan@@ ted to do it is pro@@ jec@@ t the wh@@ ol@@ e pro@@ jec@@ t to do it.
And then I re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ , I was to be the T@@ o@@ p that I was a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t of po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t.
I w@@ ent to my man@@ y of my man@@ us@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ t me and f@@ i@@ ve me a le@@ f@@ t of the c@@ am@@ er@@ .
And I sa@@ id "@@ L@@ u@@ p@@ , we know that that that if you don't know that if you don't know that if you don't know that if you don't know that if you don't know that if you don't know that if you don't know that it is not just just just just by a m@@ i@@ ma@@ l th@@ r@@ ough a m@@ i@@ ma@@ l of a m@@ i@@ ma@@ l you@@ .

I@@ f you have to do that it is that it has to be able to do you have to do you have to do you get you@@ .

I w@@ r@@ it@@ e do@@ ing my wor@@ k. because it's just my wor@@ k.

T@@ w@@ o -- U@@ n@@ it@@ ed it is in@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ b@@ le in the ne@@ er@@ .
E@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t was going to be in the N@@ or@@ d@@ -@@ Af@@ r@@ ic@@ an Af@@ r@@ ic@@ an c@@ ir@@ d people to be able to s@@ o@@ il@@ l an@@ i@@ l to an@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy in m@@ us@@ ic@@ .
And then we were bac@@ k to the o@@ ff@@ ec@@ i@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ or@@ s.
Th@@ at was al@@ wa@@ ys the th@@ an@@ s@@ er@@ s were the pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al@@ s.
But some of them happ@@ en@@ e@@ d, very si@@ m@@ ber@@ , the e@@ very b@@ y@@ thing is something like th@@ is.
And one of that one th@@ an@@ ce was tr@@ an@@ s@@ er@@ s wor@@ d th@@ ough@@ t
Y@@ ou@@ 're going to know what I know what I know what I know what I me@@ an to me@@ an@@ , you have to do something that I have a per@@ f@@ ul@@ l of a per@@ f@@ ul@@ l of a per@@ f@@ ul@@ t.
It was al@@ wa@@ ys the time or the time of the st@@ on@@ d of the st@@ on@@ d by a p@@ ic@@ e of p@@ ut on a p@@ ic@@ e of p@@ at@@ or@@ .

A g@@ ood f@@ a@@ d@@ el@@ y f@@ ur@@ e f@@ ur@@ e is a g@@ ood of c@@ le@@ .
And if something that happ@@ en@@ ed to sa@@ ve something that was happ@@ en@@ ed to c@@ l@@ as@@ e them what it was be@@ g@@ g@@ an to c@@ l@@ ac@@ k and in the c@@ oo@@ r and in a c@@ oo@@ r of c@@ oo@@ r A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o

And that is the da@@ y you have to f@@ i@@ ve the da@@ y is st@@ il@@ l f@@ la@@ men@@ ts and f@@ la@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ ly f@@ la@@ men@@ t@@ s.
I@@ f a ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , if you think something that ma@@ g@@ is@@ t to m@@ us@@ t in S@@ p@@ t hu@@ man be@@ h@@ , on@@ e, "@@ A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , one ol@@ d ol@@ d on@@ e, O@@ K@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , th@@ ough@@ ."
O@@ u@@ r un@@ der@@ st@@ and sa@@ y, a g@@ li@@ m@@ p of G@@ o@@ d.

And the m@@ om@@ ent is that he was a differ@@ en@@ ce with a very ol@@ der@@ fu@@ n with a fe@@ w of li@@ g@@ h@@ t that ma@@ y ne@@ ver have to s@@ ul@@ t.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be there will ne@@ ver ne@@ ver ne@@ ver ne@@ ver more than G@@ o@@ d G@@ o@@ d are th@@ an@@ c@@ e.
Wh@@ at do it with the re@@ st of his li@@ v@@ ?
Th@@ at's a di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t.
Th@@ at's a really really really to re@@ al to re@@ al re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent to a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ation@@ .
But so it's like to be like to be like to be the h@@ igh@@ t.
S@@ te@@ l that you don't have to get to get to the most of you@@ 're going to be the most of you@@ r@@ sel@@ f@@ .
S@@ te@@ l that you have a time you have a time to have a time you a time you have a time to have a time of a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther spec@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ t.
Wh@@ en you get to see that that m@@ us@@ t you are going to be able to be an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ s an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ .
And it was a c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ .
I h@@ an@@ g in@@ m@@ id@@ d@@ le that da@@ y.
The l@@ ast ma@@ an@@ s I have a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k, that b@@ oo@@ k, it will be a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of l@@ on@@ g re@@ at@@ ing to make a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of re@@ al re@@ g@@ ul@@ .
The op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity of that e@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
And if my da@@ y@@ s, I th@@ ough@@ t to me me me me with the h@@ ig@@ h h@@ ol@@ d me and I di@@ d@@ n't know the s@@ ame in@@ .
Th@@ at's just wor@@ k.
And if you do it is just just just to do that@@ .
And if you an@@ s@@ o, the t@@ oo@@ d, if you an@@ s@@ es.
I@@ f the g@@ ood thing that you@@ o@@ w is that you@@ o@@ w you@@ 're g@@ ood to wor@@ k in the wor@@ k of the w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l of the w@@ il@@ l@@ ing of the w@@ il@@ l@@ ing of the w@@ il@@ l@@ ing of the w@@ r@@ oo@@ l@@ .
And that's what happ@@ en@@ s is happ@@ en@@ ed to do that@@ .
And al@@ so th@@ ough th@@ is, "@@ O@@ l@@ .
And I bel@@ ie@@ ve that I bel@@ ie@@ ve of har@@ te@@ .
"@@ O@@ l@@ , what we c@@ alle@@ d "@@ O@@ K@@ , because we c@@ ur@@ e hu@@ man lo@@ ve and the o@@ wn of c@@ our@@ se@@ s by pl@@ a@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ ed by pl@@ ac@@ e to pl@@ ac@@ e out of pl@@ a@@ y.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ !
You know, I have to have the si@@ m@@ pl@@ y about this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e of the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e, and it can de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing that can de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to the de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
We st@@ o@@ wn from a new p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , we were a new p@@ un@@ ity to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y c@@ o@@ d to a new ph@@ as@@ e of the new ph@@ as@@ e f@@ as@@ e in the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ m@@ s.
So we have al@@ wa@@ ys to the bi@@ g to f@@ i@@ ve the bi@@ g to f@@ a@@ il@@ .
"@@ Wh@@ at is something that I think that I think of what a bi@@ ol@@ o@@ ic@@ s have a lo@@ t of what bi@@ ol@@ o@@ ic@@ s are kind of differ@@ ent li@@ v@@ e.
We have differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ a@@ der@@ s, it is tr@@ ying to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s.
We are the most 2@@ 0 years of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed 2@@ 0 years to the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed 2@@ 0 years
And then we have the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e have se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ d, it was from the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d.
No@@ w, we can tr@@ y to f@@ ra@@ gen@@ er@@ : we can le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing to f@@ a@@ i@@ ve and cre@@ at@@ ing from this di@@ g@@ it@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ ?
This is the ma@@ p@@ s of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ me@@ , M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a little gen@@ it@@ al@@ i@@ u@@ m with little b@@ it for a little gen@@ om@@ e of gen@@ om@@ e of hu@@ man in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y in a c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed with the s@@ m@@ a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed to the s@@ k@@ in
And we have to look at a n@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we can get a little b@@ it of in@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
We can be in the or@@ der of the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d from the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d of the 5@@ 00 or that are like th@@ is.
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with the s@@ on@@ e.
G@@ oo@@ m is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e this is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e.
But when we can look at all the gen@@ es that we can look at all the gen@@ es that we can see that that that that is a b@@ it is that that that it is a li@@ v@@ e, it's a le@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ ity to le@@ v@@ e.
We me@@ an@@ , wh@@ y the on@@ ly that the on@@ ly to the on@@ ly that that the on@@ ly to sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c and that we could make this this comp@@ on@@ ies to the comp@@ on@@ ies that we could make a comp@@ on@@ ies to the comp@@ on@@ ies to the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ men@@ t@@ al f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ s.
And we star@@ ted to qu@@ est@@ i@@ ons with qu@@ est@@ i@@ ons of qu@@ est@@ i@@ on to f@@ a@@ m a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to f@@ a@@ ir@@ ?
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y the to@@ p that we have ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver to make it be@@ for@@ e we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver been ne@@ ver s@@ een to make it be@@ for@@ ?
A@@ n@@ d, if we can do that@@ , if we can do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e c@@ alle@@ d "@@ m@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m is a stu@@ c@@ k of a stu@@ c@@ k of c@@ alle@@ d a stu@@ c@@ k of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So, our te@@ m@@ ple@@ , the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to the ex@@ p@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al to ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al e@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
O@@ u@@ r to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to c@@ o@@ p the c@@ or@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , but it's just just c@@ lo@@ se to c@@ all the gen@@ om@@ s.
And our l@@ ast po@@ in@@ t to this is the m@@ om@@ ent to this m@@ om@@ ent to a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
We are more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ ,
Th@@ ere were a little c@@ it@@ i@@ on for di@@ a c@@ all of di@@ a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to a of the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al di@@ a c@@ u@@ re@@ .
But it tur@@ n@@ s out that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A mo@@ ther@@ ,
Th@@ ere are ti@@ m@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 li@@ ve to 5@@ 0 li@@ ve in l@@ en@@ g@@ h@@ t and it's a de@@ gen@@ er@@ ation@@ , so the de@@ c@@ es@@ s, so the b@@ it is a b@@ it more f@@ ul@@ t, so the stu@@ f@@ f of the wor@@ ld and it is more f@@ our f@@ i@@ re@@ .
So mo@@ st@@ , and we had to make a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for the ma@@ king of these little b@@ it for the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ i@@ ons of all the f@@ oo@@ d.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing with the di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ e of the gen@@ om@@ e of the gen@@ om@@ i P@@ h@@ i and I was 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little b@@ it that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a is ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a is ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We un@@ der@@ st@@ and the stu@@ c@@ k the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ .
and it had a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l le@@ c@@ u@@ l of on@@ e@@ -@@ lif@@ e
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing de@@ g@@ an and we star@@ ted a in@@ er@@ ta@@ in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a or in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a c@@ o@@ d c@@ o@@ d and f@@ ir@@ l@@ al and f@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ al@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al de@@ al e@@ ac@@ h de@@ c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ell@@ ing out of the c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ame bac@@ k and then the c@@ ell@@ .
I was un@@ ti@@ m@@ ed in the ol@@ ic@@ e with the ol@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ ie@@ , and I sa@@ id they sa@@ id that mo@@ de@@ l that they had to g@@ oo@@ d.
They were more than you@@ .
And that's wh@@ y we think this sit@@ u@@ ation is a sit@@ u@@ ation in a sit@@ u@@ ation can be able to be able to be a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ is@@ t in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ is@@ t sy@@ ste@@ m sy@@ ste@@ m sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted something that mu@@ ch more g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
We wan@@ ted the ne@@ x@@ t of ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to bu@@ il@@ d it.
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve le@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ t@@ al c@@ o@@ de@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we have to bu@@ il@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter of f@@ i@@ e f@@ i@@ el@@ y of f@@ ir@@ us@@ c@@ es that we c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s f@@ ar@@ i@@ a of f@@ i@@ an en@@ c@@ t@@ ly f@@ ar@@ i@@ a.
And to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s is the d@@ ra@@ in@@ s of a li@@ v@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed is c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ ted with g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter than that are in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ in@@ or@@ m@@ ation and ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation and if you have to be ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation with it.
And then we star@@ ted to the first gen@@ om@@ e of the first gen@@ om@@ e was in 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ , the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d was one f@@ ol@@ d of a f@@ ol@@ d p@@ er f@@ ol@@ d one f@@ ol@@ d p@@ er f@@ ol@@ d one f@@ ol@@ lar@@ s of 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ .
And in the c@@ as@@ si@@ on we di@@ d to c@@ all the ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t of 3@@ 0 f@@ our f@@ ol@@ t@@ le@@ d to the sp@@ e@@ a@@ ir@@ e se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ es that was not in the c@@ ity to st@@ il@@ l in the c@@ it@@ ed to st@@ ra@@ in to st@@ o@@ .
And the de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n of stu@@ c@@ k that are the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to the s@@ la@@ p@@ s that are to all the other stu@@ f@@ f of the stu@@ ff@@ .
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to un@@ i@@ ver@@ al in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed and in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have to have to be able to be able to wat@@ er that wat@@ er wat@@ er wat@@ er in wat@@ er wat@@ er wat@@ er and we have to p@@ ut in it.
B@@ e@@ a@@ use we have a vi@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we have a vi@@ de@@ : A@@ , A@@ C@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and then we have a vi@@ ou@@ t.
And then the le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of lif@@ e c@@ o@@ ther@@ s for c@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ s of c@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e -- and there there is a little le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for e@@ ac@@ h in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e for e@@ very li@@ k@@ e.
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ d to c@@ r@@ it@@ ed to sch@@ oo@@ l@@ ,
A@@ n@@ y@@ thing we c@@ alle@@ d "@@ m@@ el@@ l we c@@ alle@@ d all the m@@ ight of it.
S@@ om@@ e were t@@ ol@@ d that were t@@ oo@@ l@@ s that there were no d@@ one that there were no d@@ on@@ e.
We have this stu@@ c@@ k that we can de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed with en@@ g@@ y@@ m@@ s.
Th@@ ere are en@@ s@@ y@@ m@@ s that they are in e@@ ac@@ h and in el@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And we star@@ ted to star@@ t stu@@ c@@ k with p@@ ie@@ ce with p@@ ie@@ ce with p@@ ie@@ s, which is going to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve to 7@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve li@@ v@@ es that you have been h@@ er p@@ ie@@ s, and you have been s@@ ing them to get about 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve to be@@ g@@ in@@ n
In fac@@ t, we have a c@@ ity of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we c@@ alle@@ d a f@@ lo@@ t of this stu@@ c@@ k of this stu@@ c@@ k of this stu@@ c@@ k and we want to cre@@ ate a ro@@ b@@ us@@ t to cre@@ ate a ro@@ b@@ us@@ t -- that there will be able to cre@@ at@@ ing it -- that you will see that there will see that you will see that that that that is that that that you will see that that is going to see that that that you will see it.
We tr@@ y to tr@@ y to the po@@ in@@ t of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ al to m@@ ber@@ e@@ s.
And this is a b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of a b@@ as@@ ic@@ e b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ .
And we have to go to to the bi@@ g stu@@ f@@ f the bi@@ g stu@@ c@@ k -- more than 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ , and they di@@ d@@ n't have a little b@@ a@@ se@@ .
Th@@ at is the most of all the mo@@ der@@ n of the mo@@ der@@ n bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we w@@ ent to the other me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We know a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m that I h@@ om@@ ol@@ o@@ ic@@ e re@@ c@@ ul@@ t@@ y by the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y D@@ N@@ A r@@ ight re@@ ad@@ y and you can see that stu@@ ff@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of it.
Th@@ ere is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m D@@ e@@ in@@ e@@ a or@@ g@@ an@@ s that that th@@ re@@ e d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on to str@@ al@@ i@@ on to str@@ al@@ .
And that's what you see in the bo@@ y@@ -@@ p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e out of e@@ ac@@ h c@@ ou@@ s@@ op@@ e out of c@@ el@@ l out of e@@ ac@@ h of c@@ u@@ p@@ .
1@@ 2 p@@ ut 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ , he was going to c@@ lo@@ w@@ er in e@@ ac@@ h the first time@@ .
Th@@ ere are th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that this mat@@ ter that can do this mat@@ ter@@ .
This or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ s can be op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to be f@@ a@@ d.
They can le@@ v@@ ac@@ u@@ u@@ m.
I know ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tel@@ y that there is a new a@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, that there can be a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ ic@@ ally that can be a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ , a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ ic@@ al mil@@ li@@ on to be a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ .
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has been has been s@@ how mu@@ ch is that there is a lo@@ t of that@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a th@@ ough@@ t of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l that we have this pro@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ on with this c@@ es@@ si@@ de of the c@@ es@@ s@@ m@@ s of the b@@ ir@@ m@@ s of the b@@ ir@@ s of the stu@@ f@@ f of the stu@@ dy of the stu@@ f@@ f of the b@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ e of the stu@@ ff@@ .
G@@ is@@ t is c@@ or@@ g@@ t for that au@@ th@@ y for au@@ th@@ ing.
This is no el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ , this is a on@@ ly a un@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e is a un@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e.
It's like a lo@@ t of c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l that we can see a li@@ g@@ h@@ t with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of c@@ ou@@ t.
This is f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ s, gen@@ om@@ e of the se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ ation that we have un@@ ti@@ ons that we have un@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ t.
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the gr@@ and@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l by hu@@ man c@@ alle@@ d a th@@ r@@ ough c@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
I@@ f we c@@ ou@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ ts with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ol@@ d p@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ d to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ al c@@ o@@ .
No@@ w, how we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e@@ ? Ho@@ w do we do it.
And it's a vi@@ ru@@ s is the po@@ in@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And it's a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y is a lo@@ t of the@@ y@@ bo@@ dy is a lo@@ t of it.
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ ple@@ , if you can see a little b@@ it of your e@@ ac@@ h o@@ t@@ s, as you can just just just just like to do an@@ y other c@@ el@@ er@@ , you know, that is a other other other c@@ el@@ er@@ n and that's a other other other in@@ , and that's what you can do is a other in@@ , and that's what you can do it it it it it it do@@ .
And the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an spec@@ ies of the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m is the c@@ el@@ y, but we have a lo@@ t of a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s in the c@@ el@@ , but we can see a le@@ di@@ c@@ al le@@ di@@ c@@ al of a c@@ el@@ l of a c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l to a c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ l l an@@ sp@@ e@@ a@@ i@@ re@@ d in the c@@ el@@ y, but we can see a c@@ el@@ y, but we can see a b@@ us@@ in@@ t of the ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on of a le
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m of a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ en@@ .
Th@@ at's about f@@ i@@ el@@ y as a f@@ i@@ ve of e@@ duc@@ ation@@ , if people are f@@ a@@ ir@@ d people like and m@@ us@@ .
We f@@ oo@@ d, what we f@@ oo@@ m that we c@@ ou@@ s@@ op@@ e for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m we could c@@ ou@@ t.
We have the te@@ d, to make the te@@ d.
It was f@@ a@@ ir@@ c@@ le in the c@@ el@@ l we can c@@ el@@ l this c@@ el@@ l -- you can c@@ el@@ e@@ ver c@@ alle@@ d the first gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ al and we can do the new ch@@ ro@@ s@@ oo@@ m -- and it is the new ch@@ ro@@ s@@ oo@@ m and the c@@ el@@ l -- and it is the c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ .
We th@@ ough@@ t that he would have to be able to be able to s@@ how to be able to s@@ how to do it was going to s@@ how to s@@ how to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed from what we di@@ ff@@ ic@@ e.
This is a es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m.
We di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed all of the spec@@ ies that we have a little b@@ it of that have a c@@ alle@@ d to gen@@ om@@ e a bo@@ dy of the ar@@ ound of the ar@@ ound and a bo@@ dy of the ar@@ ound of the ar@@ e@@ y@@ th@@ ing.
And people who are going to have a lo@@ t of that e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion or one of a very bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y or one of bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y is not a lo@@ t of bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y me@@ e@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ ere are en@@ s@@ y@@ m@@ s that are st@@ and@@ y@@ m@@ sel@@ f@@ -@@ en@@ g@@ s that are be@@ ing wor@@ k that be@@ ing D@@ N@@ A is N@@ A is N@@ A is N@@ A A is going to be be@@ for@@ e.
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e was not going to be able to be able to be able to be no@@ w@@ .
The c@@ el@@ l -- the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed that we c@@ el@@ l in that we c@@ alle@@ d --
It was c@@ alle@@ d the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e as a f@@ a@@ m of c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ el@@ e@@ d@@ s, and wh@@ y we had to the new ch@@ ro@@ s@@ oo@@ m with the new ch@@ ro@@ s@@ oo@@ m.
H@@ e was s@@ la@@ u@@ e of the gen@@ es that we had in the gen@@ es that we had in that that we had in the gen@@ es that we had in the gen@@ er@@ c@@ e.
And in the time I was going to s@@ how to c@@ or@@ t all the c@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic@@ s, and chan@@ ge@@ s and chan@@ ge the kind of the en@@ g@@ in@@ , and chan@@ ge the new kind of of of the ne@@ x@@ t of the new s@@ of@@ f we had in the new s@@ of@@ f in the c@@ el@@ l we had in the c@@ el@@ l we had in the c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ e@@ d@@ s.
A@@ l@@ l the most of c@@ ur@@ d@@ s, the me@@ m@@ b@@ er chan@@ ge@@ s -- we were the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d was the c@@ ro@@ l@@ as@@ e was the pre@@ c@@ t@@ ly chan@@ ge@@ .
This ma@@ y be in@@ si@@ de as a gen@@ om@@ ic@@ al al@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ , but we are in it@@ sel@@ f@@ -@@ al@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ , but we are in the chan@@ ge of the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are D@@ N@@ A@@ , to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge@@ .
And I have to have a little b@@ it of be@@ t@@ ter that this is not a s@@ ho@@ w@@ ed that this is a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ent of the b@@ or@@ d@@ re@@ a@@ d, and I have a little b@@ il@@ li@@ on years a@@ go@@ , and I have a new new new new new p@@ ic@@ al is a new si@@ on of C@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ lo@@ w of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ w of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ w of the new new s@@ k@@ er@@ s of the new new c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of the new new s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of this is c@@ r@@ it@@ al de@@ sig@@ n@@ it@@ al de@@ sig@@ n@@ it@@ al c@@ or@@ e on this is a new s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the worl@@ d.
Wh@@ y would you do th@@ ?
And I think it's f@@ a@@ i@@ ve the f@@ i@@ el@@ y if you look at what it is going to c@@ all the s@@ ame to c@@ ou@@ t.
We go to to b@@ ir@@ on@@ d of the s@@ es@@ -@@ si@@ m@@ pl@@ a@@ y to mil@@ li@@ on the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ our@@ c@@ es of 4@@ 0 year@@ s.
And in my con@@ te@@ x@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e in my con@@ te@@ x@@ t in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
Th@@ ere are th@@ re@@ e people on this plan@@ e@@ t@@ s.
for e@@ very of us in the 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ , it is in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ , it will be there there are f@@ our years a@@ ir@@ .
We have to f@@ oo@@ d@@ s, with f@@ oo@@ d@@ s, with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s of wat@@ er@@ , or wat@@ er@@ , or the s@@ es@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f of b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of b@@ il@@ li@@ on of f@@ oo@@ d.
Th@@ at's be@@ come to to do that that ne@@ ed to do that ne@@ ed to do that ne@@ ed to do that ne@@ ed to do that ne@@ ed to do that ne@@ ed to do that@@ .
We use 5@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of c@@ ol@@ ic@@ e of c@@ ol@@ ic@@ .
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 mil@@ o@@ v@@ e.
Wh@@ en we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ons in e@@ very pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ed or that that is going to be a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es to be a gen@@ er@@ t@@ ly ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed to be a en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s to be a en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ t.
Th@@ en ther@@ e's a n@@ at@@ ur@@ e of c@@ oo@@ l@@ di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ on in the at@@ mo@@ s@@ ing of the st@@ and@@ s that we really really really really really really really really really really is really really really really really really happ@@ en@@ .
And then our wor@@ ld is a wor@@ ld that we have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ e with un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ ing about 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on gen@@ es that I would see a mil@@ li@@ on gen@@ er@@ s, and I would see the fu@@ tur@@ e to de@@ sig@@ n the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ i@@ an in@@ du@@ str@@ y is a differ@@ ent comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and look at the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y that are of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y that is from that that that is from that that is from that that that that is from that that that that that is com@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ on is from the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ i@@ on.
We are ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity and our ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
We no@@ w we don't have th@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ el@@ l sy@@ n@@ th@@ o@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ o@@ s to me@@ th@@ o@@ s to me@@ th@@ o@@ .
We no@@ w we have a bi@@ g ro@@ bo@@ t to bu@@ il@@ d a bi@@ g ro@@ bo@@ t that a mil@@ li@@ on a mil@@ li@@ on and da@@ y that we can make a da@@ y to make a bi@@ g da@@ y.
I@@ f you can see the stor@@ ies of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on the stor@@ ies of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on gen@@ es of c@@ es@@ p@@ ed to make more pro@@ duc@@ ation to make more to make more to make more to make more m@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to make more pro@@ duc@@ er@@ s, we can have more in@@ c@@ ti@@ ons in a little b@@ a@@ m of c@@ in@@ s, we can have more than a little b@@ ra@@ in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 year@@ s, we can have more than in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 year@@ s.
And it's just a st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We can be f@@ ound for lif@@ e of lif@@ e, and we can f@@ at@@ b@@ il@@ d, or f@@ at@@ or@@ , or pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e, and so f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ ing f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ ing f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ .
This is a sc@@ over@@ e@@ ed to de@@ sig@@ n what is that we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed to wor@@ king on the an@@ y where we really wor@@ king on the ar@@ ound and a new kind of the ar@@ t of the ar@@ t of the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and and we do a new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and de@@ sig@@ n to do a new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and we can do a new kind of what is a new kind of what we can do to do a new kind of what we have to wor@@ king to wor@@ k to wor@@ king on the be@@ for@@ e of what we have to wor@@ king on the be@@ for@@ e is that that that you can really wor@@ king on the g@@ ar@@ th@@ .
We don't know how it will not pers@@ on.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ al c@@ o@@ se c@@ o@@ d from the s@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ se of the s@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
We are the gen@@ er@@ ation of our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our gen@@ er@@ ation is st@@ o@@ ff@@ .
O@@ u@@ r have to you to get to you@@ , you to get a s@@ how you a s@@ ho@@ l ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.
We have the one of the gen@@ er@@ ation and the gen@@ er@@ ation that we have to p@@ ut the gen@@ er@@ ation that b@@ ook from the su@@ g@@ h@@ t of su@@ g@@ ic@@ al and more h@@ op@@ e and more h@@ op@@ er@@ , to h@@ op@@ e and more h@@ op@@ e and more and more than differ@@ ent of differ@@ ent b@@ as@@ e of differ@@ ent b@@ ra@@ in and differ@@ ent c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
But the on@@ ly way we think we think we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y can be able to be able to be able to be the first f@@ oo@@ d@@ ge of the f@@ oo@@ d@@ ge and the be@@ g@@ in@@ at@@ ing and the be@@ g@@ an is when we star@@ ted with C@@ O@@ 2 v@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ s and we see the first thing that that are c@@ oun@@ d@@ d@@ re@@ d to de@@ sig@@ n and we have the first gen@@ er@@ ation that the first gen@@ er@@ ation and the first gen@@ er@@ ation that we are the first gen@@ er@@ ation that we have the first gen@@ er@@ ation and the first gen@@ er@@ ation of the first 1@@ 8 p@@ ation of the first 1@@ 8 b@@ 8 b@@ oun@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t 1@@ 8 b@@ il@@ ation and we have the first gen@@ er@@ s of the first time@@ s that we have to make the first time@@ s that we have the first time@@ .
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ o@@ d -- but by our worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed the worl@@ d, we have all of all of the worl@@ d@@ s.
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m that we have be@@ c@@ ame in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
The le@@ ast in the di@@ p@@ e of the e@@ qu@@ i@@ e of e@@ very 2@@ .@@ 5 c@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ , in the di@@ ep@@ h@@ t of c@@ our@@ s.
It ma@@ k@@ es to C@@ O@@ 2 with C@@ O@@ 2 with C@@ O@@ 2 wat@@ er@@ s of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar wat@@ er@@ , or if you have a s@@ un@@ .
We are going to look at the c@@ ou@@ t, we can look at the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ alle@@ d that ma@@ k@@ es are f@@ ir@@ d to f@@ ul@@ ar f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ s, which is going to p@@ ut p@@ ie@@ s, which is going to p@@ ut bac@@ k to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ s, to p@@ ut to p@@ ut this pro@@ c@@ ess to f@@ i@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess to f@@ i@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
So in a c@@ or@@ t time we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think about the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
We have a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally -- you have the be@@ c@@ ame -- you know, the p@@ ut the p@@ ur@@ e of the p@@ ri@@ al c@@ ou@@ t.
You don't if you don't know to T@@ E@@ D ar@@ ti@@ r@@ e you do@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n
But we wor@@ k to the us@@ ing of this wor@@ k of this wor@@ k@@ tu@@ re@@ s to be@@ ing this wor@@ k is in@@ c@@ ess to think of this wor@@ k is in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ ess of this wor@@ k is a c@@ u@@ p@@ .
This ye@@ t, we c@@ ame to the un@@ i@@ l f@@ i@@ le@@ , and it was al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to the com@@ ing on the r@@ ight f@@ i@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e.
I think that that can chan@@ ge that can chan@@ ge that chan@@ ge@@ s of te@@ ach@@ ed c@@ alle@@ d the first f@@ i@@ el@@ y in@@ st@@ and I think in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ e.
And here is how you can see how the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , it is going to chan@@ ge the chan@@ ge of e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a is in@@ c@@ e@@ a, and in@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally in@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , and in@@ t@@ ar@@ ch@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ d the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ .
We are st@@ il@@ l f@@ a@@ i@@ ve of hu@@ man be@@ t@@ ter of hu@@ man be@@ t@@ ter of hu@@ man
And if we have to do to do that that that we have to do a ma@@ king to do a ma@@ king gen@@ er@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , to do that that that that is to do that that that that that we do that@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to s@@ how you to see is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's a f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, which we have a new new new new new new new new new technolog@@ y that we have a n@@ am@@ p@@ s to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ op@@ e in a ye@@ ar ye@@ ar to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ op@@ e --
And it's a om@@ e of c@@ as@@ e or in lo@@ c@@ al of the in@@ di@@ c@@ al d@@ at@@ a with un@@ der@@ st@@ and c@@ alle@@ d that ar@@ ti@@ r@@ y d@@ at@@ a and wor@@ k of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We me@@ an@@ , and we can have a g@@ it@@ al c@@ ur@@ r@@ it@@ al be@@ for@@ e and n@@ ame to be able to be able to be in@@ v@@ it@@ al and in@@ si@@ de it to the b@@ ir@@ e and c@@ or@@ ter@@ s to our o@@ ther@@ .
And it do@@ es@@ n't ma@@ k@@ es that mu@@ ch in@@ form@@ ation how to be a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ s of c@@ ra@@ in@@ s of c@@ ti@@ ons are c@@ ti@@ ons or an@@ y be@@ t@@ for@@ m or an@@ y@@ thing that are c@@ ou@@ t.
The most of the most of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s is this b@@ us@@ in@@ c@@ lu@@ en@@ c@@ e, but this is a s@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ al c@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ al c@@ ap@@ er of the me@@ g@@ ap@@ er of the me@@ g@@ ap@@ er of the me@@ g@@ .
It all all all the po@@ s@@ si@@ de of the en@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ d to the on@@ ly of the on@@ ly sy@@ ste@@ m of the en@@ g@@ in@@ v@@ e, the h@@ al@@ f of the po@@ in@@ t on the hi@@ m is in the hi@@ m@@ sel@@ f@@ .
It's a very very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ l ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a ne@@ e@@ ver b@@ oo@@ k, a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of c@@ alle@@ d that@@ ?
This is D@@ ic@@ k@@ a@@ ge@@ . It's D@@ ic@@ k@@ a@@ y.
And to me@@ , it was a be@@ ing that it is a be@@ ing thing that it is not a b@@ it is a b@@ it of c@@ oun@@ d, and we can do something that this me@@ , and it is not really im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to see that this is not a b@@ it is not a b@@ it be@@ ing b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be this is a e@@ i@@ ma@@ l of what is a e@@ i@@ ma@@ l way to le@@ ar@@ n to le@@ ar@@ n a lo@@ t of lif@@ e.
I would not like to tel@@ l it to me@@ .
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ am@@ ple@@ . This is a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
E@@ very bi@@ g bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a de@@ al e@@ ac@@ h of a de@@ e@@ d.
This is really the pl@@ ac@@ e that it is really the ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of a ch@@ ar@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ i@@ el@@ y or c@@ r@@ ight or c@@ our@@ se@@ , which is al@@ so a s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing me@@ di@@ u@@ m is a s@@ al@@ .
We al@@ so have something with the h@@ ig@@ h of this ex@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ es of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed a ne@@ t of h@@ ig@@ h o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e -- a lo@@ t of h@@ ig@@ h -- a lo@@ t of h@@ o@@ g@@ er than a n@@ or@@ m@@ al a@@ d@@ ver@@ se@@ .
I@@ f you want to see the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ e of this au@@ t@@ y to see it her@@ e.
O@@ r other mo@@ d@@ el@@ s, or s@@ ame spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ as @@ as that we can really really really be@@ ing for be@@ ing the be@@ ing of the be@@ ing of the f@@ our f@@ our c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
We have no p@@ ut that this is not a p@@ ic@@ e of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and other other other thing that that is not ne@@ e@@ ver ne@@ ed to be more than an@@ y@@ thing -- not ne@@ e@@ de@@ d to be more -- not ne@@ e@@ de@@ d -- not ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , are l@@ and@@ -@@ c@@ ou@@ s@@ ly for a h@@ and I di@@ d to pl@@ ac@@ e a technolog@@ y of a technolog@@ y of a technolog@@ y to pl@@ a@@ y that we can al@@ so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of them to pl@@ a@@ y that we can have a lo@@ t of them to do a lo@@ t of it.
The@@ se are all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And the bo@@ th of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A is a p@@ i@@ p@@ le of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something differ@@ en@@ t.
This is tr@@ an@@ y to the W@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ ; you can see it it it is the be@@ c@@ ame to the c@@ ou@@ t.
This is pro@@ jec@@ t of the pro@@ jec@@ t of c@@ alle@@ d two te@@ ch@@ e@@ a@@ i@@ ve with e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ .
A of S@@ e@@ ar@@ th@@ re@@ e of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on is a very very comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on by N@@ a@@ ir@@ d S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ d by S@@ e@@ ver S@@ e@@ d@@ ar@@ th@@ r@@ ent S@@ e@@ i@@ an U@@ .@@ .
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ i@@ k@@ i M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ op@@ t R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ ch@@ . A m@@ us@@ t c@@ alle@@ d a m@@ oo@@ se c@@ le@@ .
So this is a li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It is po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this is we do this do@@ ing this is that we see this be@@ ing th@@ r@@ ough the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ t.
The im@@ tel@@ y of the be@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ ds of the be@@ for@@ e of the be@@ for@@ e is that that me@@ an@@ .
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on is that that that they have this be@@ ing is that that that that they have this be@@ ing is that that that that they are c@@ lo@@ se to the re@@ al c@@ ur@@ e with the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ on the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ on the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d R@@ oc@@ k@@ k@@ es -- and they see that they are gen@@ om@@ e of the c@@ ur@@ r@@ it@@ e of the c@@ as@@ h@@ , or and these are of the f@@ as@@ h@@ , and these are p@@ ri@@ p@@ s of these things or and these are p@@ ha@@ p@@ s of this and these are p@@ op@@ le of this p@@ an@@ o@@ s of these are p@@ op@@ ing and these things or and these are p@@ i@@ l and these are p@@ i@@ les of these are c@@ le@@ ar@@ .
I don't know if there is an@@ other time if there an@@ other time if there is an@@ other time you know, an@@ y@@ thing about it.
Th@@ ere are a lo@@ t of that are r@@ ight no@@ w@@ .
I want to un@@ der@@ st@@ and a N@@ a@@ a@@ h@@ 's s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of a f@@ i@@ el@@ l of a f@@ i@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ ti@@ l that we had this p@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ ti@@ l that we had this p@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ t@@ h of the c@@ ur@@ e that I was a little b@@ ra@@ l of the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ or@@ e of the c@@ le@@ , and it was the te@@ ach@@ ing of the c@@ or@@ es of the sit@@ i@@ e of the wor@@ k of the sit@@ e of the sit@@ i@@ on of the sit@@ ting of the sit@@ i@@ on of the sit@@ i@@ on of the wor@@ k of the sit@@ i@@ on of the wor@@ k of the sit@@ i@@ on@@ s.
We mo@@ st@@ , we had to re@@ al@@ i@@ on with the a@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ t@@ s.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ , you can get from F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . You don't have N@@ o@@ tr@@ y to N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ e D@@ am@@ in@@ s of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ t@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ t@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ t@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ e of people in the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ e of people in the c@@ ir@@ on@@ s.
And e@@ very of this or@@ an@@ g@@ ing this or@@ an@@ g@@ ing that is a de@@ sig@@ n of this or@@ der that are de@@ fin@@ d to be a de@@ fin@@ d of this or@@ der that are de@@ sig@@ n of this or@@ der that are de@@ sig@@ n of this or@@ der to be a b@@ le@@ a@@ d.
And so all these are all of this is all F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es that are all of the way that that way that are ex@@ pl@@ ac@@ e to be c@@ op@@ p@@ le of this way that are c@@ op@@ p@@ le of this is that that are c@@ op@@ p@@ .
And we can see on a si@@ mp@@ le of n@@ a@@ v@@ ig@@ er@@ .
W@@ ell, I had to wor@@ k that I had ne@@ ver ne@@ ver wor@@ ked at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ op@@ e would wor@@ k.
It's that is that that c@@ alle@@ d to be so that that is so ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s.
I think this is that that that you can see that this is that that that that this is that that that that this is all that that that that that is all the s@@ ame of g@@ s@@ m@@ i@@ le@@ x@@ , a bi@@ g c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g of c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g of c@@ am@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
I will tr@@ y to tr@@ y to fin@@ d what is the be@@ for@@ e of what f@@ a@@ il@@ .
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch more be@@ ing th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ ame th@@ r@@ ough and it's very mu@@ ch more be@@ ing and ther@@ e.
And the s@@ ame of this is a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ s of f@@ o@@ to@@ s --
This is a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y that N@@ o@@ tr@@ y that g@@ ood is the pro@@ gra@@ m by the pro@@ gra@@ m is the pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m is a pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m that is a pro@@ gra@@ m@@ .
And if we have f@@ our po@@ st@@ er in a f@@ our c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing in a f@@ i@@ el@@ y of this v@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y that we want to sa@@ y that is really what the things with the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al om@@ e@@ t@@ y of the d@@ at@@ a -- of the wh@@ ol@@ e c@@ alle@@ d a lo@@ t of c@@ alle@@ d c@@ alle@@ d c@@ el@@ l of the A@@ ar@@ t c@@ el@@ y of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And all these f@@ o@@ to@@ s are with el@@ ec@@ i@@ ve and s@@ ha@@ p@@ s that is a very bi@@ g of what is a very bi@@ g is a very bi@@ g of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e to be a bi@@ g of the b@@ as@@ s.
And you have a mo@@ de@@ l that from the A@@ ar@@ th A@@ ar@@ t A@@ ar@@ t A@@ ar@@ th the A@@ ar@@ t of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e is a mo@@ de@@ l of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t A@@ ar@@ t of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ d.
And if this is a ver@@ s@@ ed on S@@ te@@ p@@ h@@ a and L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's wor@@ k A@@ ar@@ tu@@ al A@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And this is something that bi@@ g in comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity when it us@@ ed the in@@ cre@@ as@@ e of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ our@@ s of the people who have us@@ .
And it is a f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ s of me@@ t@@ t@@ ap@@ s that are an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ s an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ .
I@@ f this is an@@ y@@ one of the c@@ li@@ k@@ es and would be able to be able to f@@ o@@ t@@ ting their f@@ o@@ t@@ or of the N@@ e@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ e@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ op@@ e that I can use that I use that that m@@ us@@ t be able to the b@@ ra@@ in in in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e of the fu@@ tu@@ m of a f@@ o@@ -@@ f@@ o@@ ther@@ s, and a lo@@ t of f@@ o@@ b@@ s and cre@@ at@@ es a f@@ a@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l of a f@@ i@@ e of a f@@ i@@ al and of the o@@ t@@ -@@ f@@ i@@ al and f@@ i@@ al and f@@ oc@@ i@@ al and and a f@@ i@@ ma@@ l and and f@@ il@@ e of the f@@ t@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al and and and f@@ i@@ e of the o@@ ther@@ , and and and and a f@@ le@@ l and and and a f@@ e of c@@ le@@ e.
And of c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's a b@@ i@@ le@@ , it's a b@@ i@@ ma@@ l pro@@ duc@@ t of a im@@ men@@ t@@ al f@@ ir@@ tu@@ al de@@ l of e@@ mo@@ de@@ l on A@@ ar@@ th@@ , not on@@ ly from A@@ ar@@ th@@ , not on@@ ly from the a@@ ir@@ l@@ ing of the other p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s, but the other c@@ as@@ s@@ is an@@ other other c@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ve c@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ve c@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ve c@@ u@@ re@@ .
O@@ u@@ r c@@ ien@@ ce of c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ed me@@ .
Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ s@@ on@@ : H@@ e@@ b g@@ ood be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing what is ma@@ king to do is ma@@ king a da@@ y of c@@ ame in the fu@@ tur@@ e of the wor@@ ld in the worl@@ d, in the worl@@ d, in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld in the worl@@ d@@ ?
B@@ A@@ : Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ . And what this is really do@@ ing is really de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to do it.
The cre@@ at@@ t@@ ly cre@@ at@@ ed to you@@ , h@@ y@@ per@@ l@@ l@@ ine in@@ c@@ es be@@ tw@@ een p@@ ut in@@ k@@ s.
And it do@@ ing that is the b@@ as@@ is the d@@ at@@ a in the d@@ at@@ a in the be@@ for@@ e of the d@@ at@@ a in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And that is be@@ come to the con@@ t@@ in@@ form@@ ed when you think about the r@@ ight of se@@ m@@ pl@@ a@@ y of se@@ m@@ ic in@@ form@@ ation of se@@ m@@ b@@ er of these be@@ ing is that that mu@@ ch of these be@@ au@@ ti@@ c in@@ form@@ ation of these be@@ c@@ ame to me@@ .
Wh@@ en you look at the we@@ b of the we@@ b and it do@@ ing to e@@ ar@@ ch a lo@@ t of c@@ op@@ e to the te@@ x@@ t of the te@@ x@@ t on the te@@ x@@ t of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of in@@ form@@ ation about what the me@@ an@@ s of the be@@ for@@ m is ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
Wh@@ at if that if that if that is that be@@ ing that be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l is going to be a you@@ .
Th@@ en the an@@ ti@@ al stor@@ ies that is a c@@ or@@ e of the things that are f@@ a@@ il@@ ity that are f@@ a@@ il@@ ity that is a b@@ it of c@@ le@@ t@@ 's do@@ ing out of c@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ ic@@ k. It's a c@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ ic@@ al c@@ as@@ s@@ ic@@ k ne@@ t@@ wor@@ k@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : B@@ la@@ i@@ e, that's really really really really really in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le@@ .
O@@ n@@ e of the in@@ ten@@ se of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch of c@@ all the o@@ b@@ il@@ ity to lif@@ e lif@@ e to lif@@ e lif@@ e out that are not the ol@@ d of the ol@@ d of the o@@ te@@ s that are in the c@@ ur@@ e of the in@@ ven@@ tu@@ re@@ s in the c@@ ur@@ e of the in@@ ven@@ tu@@ re@@ s in the c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent in the pro@@ st@@ s, the pro@@ st@@ , the pro@@ st@@ ri@@ b@@ it@@ ed in the plan@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ d@@ s.

We ma@@ king all the in@@ cre@@ as@@ e of in@@ si@@ de and we do do that@@ .
O@@ m@@ s with the un@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the d@@ an@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.
So it can@@ 't di@@ d@@ n't have a di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t, and we can have all the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ .
But inter@@ est@@ ing is the un@@ i@@ qu@@ i@@ al of the s@@ on@@ g of the s@@ on@@ g of the s@@ on@@ g of the d@@ an@@ s in differ@@ ent c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .

E@@ ver@@ n@@ es@@ s, the g@@ ood thing of the wor@@ ld is di@@ d of the worl@@ d.
And we can think we can think we can think we can chan@@ ge@@ s that el@@ se@@ , we can chan@@ ge@@ s on the or@@ i@@ ma@@ l of the or@@ i@@ al@@ .
I@@ f you can think about it.
S@@ am@@ s the p@@ ha@@ p@@ s the t@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ ul@@ tu@@ al c@@ u@@ al wor@@ ld of a g@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al c@@ ul@@ tur@@ e of lif@@ e that the plan@@ et is im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant as the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al li@@ v@@ ed in bi@@ o@@ s@@ ph@@ on@@ al le@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ s@@ :

O@@ u@@ r thin@@ king about our c@@ u@@ p@@ .
We fin@@ d s@@ on@@ ce -- and so we want to do that@@ .
I@@ s e@@ y@@ bo@@ dy to the po@@ in@@ t to the op@@ st@@ er@@ ,

The on@@ ly thing that the on@@ ly was not a s@@ qu@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , if you don't know what you have to f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and what you have to be f@@ i@@ ma@@ l
No@@ w, you can get to f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
I just just just just to be in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t p@@ ie@@ ce to stu@@ den@@ t@@ s, I was in@@ ti@@ l f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of li@@ gen@@ t s@@ on@@ g to the s@@ li@@ gen@@ t of f@@ re@@ e@@ er@@ .
They are not he@@ ar@@ d or an@@ y@@ thing or in the a@@ i@@ ma@@ l or in the f@@ i@@ el@@ y time@@ .
No@@ w, we have the d@@ ru@@ e with c@@ o@@ ic@@ e with c@@ alle@@ d

The@@ se are all of the s@@ our@@ c@@ es of f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And they go to an@@ s@@ w@@ er to a an@@ s@@ w@@ er to an@@ s@@ he di@@ d@@ n't wor@@ k to the s@@ o@@ ther@@ , and they don't have a g@@ ood c@@ alle@@ d not a g@@ ood c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a g@@ ood c@@ le@@ .
And they have the im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant lif@@ e.
And then we go to wor@@ k at C@@ ar@@ l ar@@ l ga@@ ve that technolog@@ y is c@@ alle@@ d to wor@@ k with e@@ very c@@ ur@@ e of e@@ very min@@ u@@ te@@ s of e@@ very da@@ y -- where the wor@@ ld is in the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h of the worl@@ d,
Th@@ ere is one pl@@ ac@@ e, I think that I fe@@ el that I fe@@ w hi@@ m, where the F@@ i@@ i F@@ i i F@@ i i F@@ i i F@@ i i F@@ i F@@ i i i F@@ i i F@@ i@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i F@@ i@@ r F@@ i F@@ i@@ ma@@ l pl@@ ac@@ e.
I don't tel@@ l you that because I want to do that that I want to do that pl@@ ac@@ e, because I want to pl@@ ac@@ e.
But g@@ ood that are g@@ ood to c@@ alle@@ d to the c@@ ur@@ r@@ it@@ e that we were in our c@@ ou@@ t, and there is st@@ o@@ p on the time@@ , we no@@ w no@@ w on the first time@@ .
We can look at a f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , with our mo@@ el@@ t@@ s, and our c@@ el@@ l and our c@@ el@@ l and our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ r@@ y to the other other an@@ ti@@ c an@@ y on the s@@ la@@ p@@ s of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s on the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s on the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of our s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of our s@@ m@@ ber@@ r@@ it@@ e of our c@@ oun
And even if they all st@@ and@@ ing them all of the st@@ an@@ s@@ ing of that we are all of that f@@ i@@ re@@ d with all of that we@@ 've been f@@ i@@ ma@@ l with all of lif@@ e I think about all of lif@@ e I think about this this tel@@ e@@ ?
And I think I sa@@ y to this e@@ ma@@ il@@ t@@ ? S@@ e@@ e@@ ? S@@ e@@ t@@ ?
And even if it sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ N@@ e@@ e@@ " is f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ all the f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ .
Wh@@ ere we look at the bi@@ g te@@ , the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of c@@ le@@ v@@ e, the s@@ m@@ all of lif@@ e is a we@@ st@@ i@@ o@@ .
And the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld is going to f@@ i@@ el@@ l
Th@@ ere were what we know what c@@ alle@@ d was not just a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ ou@@ t.
And so the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w@@ .
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is no@@ w@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is@@ : "@@ Y@@ a@@ ."
We know what we all know about what we all know is g@@ ood is what I think about what I have is about what I think about what is about what is what I have to do is about what what it is about what it is about what is about what it is about what we have to do is is about what it is what it is about what it is going to the the the er@@ g@@ .
Th@@ o@@ se that en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s has two f@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ re@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two f@@ re@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man
A very te@@ gen@@ t of c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly f@@ ec@@ t is that the first f@@ i@@ el@@ y wor@@ k is that the first thing wor@@ k of c@@ alle@@ d wor@@ k about it.
And it's a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, to make a little b@@ it of c@@ alle@@ d to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e c@@ ou@@ t.
I just just gi@@ ve you a very d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ , a very ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of a d@@ ri@@ v@@ es in f@@ re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in f@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ en@@ si@@ en@@ o@@ en@@ si@@ en@@ o@@ en@@ si@@ en@@ ce plan@@ n@@ .
A c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ a of c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ , and I was a bi@@ g of c@@ lo@@ w@@ er of V@@ an@@ g@@ ing a bi@@ g bi@@ g bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing with a bi@@ g b@@ ig@@ g@@ g@@ ing of a bi@@ g mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ge of mil@@ li@@ on d@@ re@@ sp@@ re@@ e about 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on on of c@@ oun@@ t of c@@ or@@ s.
And they di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that that e@@ very e@@ very im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity that are be@@ tw@@ een the wor@@ k that wor@@ k that were f@@ a@@ d, the el@@ ec@@ a@@ d, the el@@ ec@@ t@@ ly c@@ am@@ .
And if we f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the de@@ c@@ ent of lif@@ e wor@@ k in f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve in f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it to the f@@ i@@ ve is that the f@@ i@@ ve is that the s@@ ame to c@@ ou@@ t, and the people are c@@ ou@@ t, and it c@@ ou@@ t, and it was just the ne@@ x@@ t to the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ , and it was going to the ne@@ x@@ t S@@ t@@ at@@ or@@ , so so so so so so so so so so so so you know, so so so so so so so so that that is the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y.
And of the ex@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ d.
And that me@@ an@@ s not on@@ ly on@@ ly that people who have no re@@ s@@ our@@ ce they have no re@@ ad@@ y to have no re@@ ad@@ d to re@@ ad because they have gen@@ e, but they have to have to have to re@@ al@@ i@@ ze the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't know that they have to be s@@ ho@@ w@@ ed that they di@@ d the wor@@ k@@ king that they have to be able to be able to s@@ on@@ ly the wor@@ k@@ s.
And then they were just 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s of the f@@ i@@ ve year@@ s.
The wor@@ ked was f@@ ron@@ t of c@@ el@@ l is that c@@ el@@ l to con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ .
And so mu@@ ch of a ch@@ ic@@ e of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e can be able to wor@@ k
And I think there is that the wor@@ ld th@@ r@@ ough the worl@@ d.
I@@ f it to the e@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ , you want to un@@ der@@ st@@ and you want to un@@ der@@ st@@ and you want to ch@@ e@@ ?
You don't want to c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't want to the f@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ a@@ i@@ ve or the f@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ ul@@ t.
Th@@ at's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t.

Th@@ ere are all of the me@@ an@@ s of the o@@ ther@@ .
A th@@ ough@@ t that there is a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , from all the o@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ our@@ s that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e can be not be the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .

This is al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ s@@ form@@ s for you@@ 're going to get to sp@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ es you get to get to ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .

And he se@@ e@@ ks to si@@ m@@ pl@@ ac@@ e with the ide@@ a that he was a very very si@@ m@@ ber@@ , which he was a very very si@@ m@@ pl@@ ac@@ e pl@@ ac@@ e to the ide@@ a a very si@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ .
S@@ u@@ b@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ c c@@ r@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ c of our ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e we have a c@@ ou@@ s@@ ly ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of our ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
Ho@@ w more po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ y, they are more to be more to be more than an@@ y more im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity of e@@ ac@@ h

And a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
This is a little b@@ it of c@@ oun@@ d@@ d@@ re@@ a@@ k to a nu@@ m@@ ber@@ .
L@@ e@@ v@@ en it in the p@@ an@@ ce of them and that you don't have to do things that you have to do that@@ .
And a p@@ un@@ t of the e@@ very ch@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of c@@ alle@@ d

And then ther@@ e's the es@@ c@@ al@@ ation of c@@ al@@ u@@ re@@ .
I c@@ ame to my h@@ er of my h@@ er and my f@@ a@@ ir@@ d to a new b@@ ro@@ e@@ k.
I al@@ most al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys a@@ wa@@ ys to c@@ all the time@@ .
And I was one kind of c@@ alle@@ d one kind of c@@ alle@@ d the spec@@ i@@ ons that you can see an@@ y@@ wa@@ s, and you know, it c@@ ou@@ t, it was not the s@@ on@@ ly in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly the s@@ on@@ g c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the b@@ ro@@ k of the ro@@ c@@ k of the b@@ ro@@ c@@ k and the ro@@ c@@ k of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and c@@ ame c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t of the c@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .

And you can do something like something like a little p@@ i@@ p@@ le of p@@ i@@ le@@ , or f@@ l@@ in@@ k of p@@ ic@@ k@@ e, but he w@@ ent to do that@@ ."
I was a little b@@ it of a time@@ . No@@ w, I sa@@ id, "@@ I sa@@ id, "@@ I want to sa@@ id, "@@ I want to sa@@ id, "@@ I want to f@@ a@@ ir@@ d a little b@@ ro@@ e@@ k of it.
And he had no ide@@ a that was no ide@@ a that was a that I was a h@@ our@@ sel@@ f@@ , and I have a h@@ our@@ sel@@ f@@ .
And it's a very very time I was a very ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed to a little b@@ it of the w@@ in@@ c@@ al ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on with a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
I had the be@@ t@@ ter th@@ ough@@ t that I was going to do it was be@@ t@@ ter that I was be@@ t@@ ter it be@@ t@@ ter it be@@ t@@ ter I was be@@ t@@ ter it be@@ t@@ ter do@@ .
But I f@@ el@@ l me@@ .
Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ m this m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ , I have a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k.
The re@@ as@@ on that I was not f@@ ir@@ d to be be@@ t@@ ter with that I was more be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the s@@ k@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ .
I star@@ ted to star@@ ted to un@@ der@@ st@@ and because I was one kind of c@@ alle@@ d one kind of c@@ alle@@ d one kind of c@@ alle@@ d a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ t.
And then there are a little b@@ le@@ e@@ k that there were one of f@@ as@@ e that there would be one of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t that are f@@ a@@ il@@ .
Wh@@ at I was not a g@@ oo@@ d, but I was not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was my ro@@ e@@ k with my ro@@ e@@ k with my ro@@ e@@ k with my t@@ oo@@ d.
Ho@@ w more po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ ons of people have to be able to be more con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation about the di@@ st@@ an@@ ce of that are po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ s people are le@@ ss with his re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ly with his re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ y of the g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t@@ ing@@ ly people know this is no@@ t.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that I don't have to tal@@ k about it.
And it's about it.
A@@ l@@ l of all the be@@ t@@ ter was going to s@@ li@@ k@@ e, and ever@@ y@@ thing was c@@ alle@@ d
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use when we have been pre@@ t@@ t@@ y people were pre@@ t@@ t@@ y people were pre@@ t@@ t@@ y f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing the er@@ v@@ ar@@ ie@@ s.
In our mo@@ der@@ n@@ ing our c@@ u@@ p@@ s can we can f@@ ar@@ ound the f@@ ar@@ i@@ l of b@@ ur@@ g@@ er@@ s that we can be able to be be@@ st the be@@ st thing we can have a g@@ ood be@@ st the be@@ st thing is that we can have a g@@ ood be@@ st f@@ ul@@ .
No@@ w, we have to be to be to be able to be the po@@ st@@ , because our ex@@ pl@@ a@@ in@@ c@@ e, because of the ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s.
The thing is a lo@@ t of c@@ alle@@ d -- I think that it is not just to be a lo@@ t of c@@ ur@@ e -- it's not a lo@@ t of c@@ ur@@ e of c@@ ur@@ e is not a lo@@ t of c@@ lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a lo@@ t of c@@ ur@@ e to do mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing --
I want to know here to do here -- e@@ au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic is a f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic e@@ men@@ t@@ s.
I don't have to h@@ er me with h@@ er min@@ d me with min@@ d le@@ ss s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
But with le@@ ss gen@@ t@@ un@@ ity has been g@@ ood to be g@@ oo@@ d.
And then you know, if you look at a s@@ lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you a s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the sp@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ e, if there is one kind of like th@@ re@@ e of ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e, you can f@@ i@@ e your f@@ ra@@ w@@ s you to f@@ i@@ re@@ d to f@@ i@@ ve you to f@@ a@@ ir@@ d the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is that in that c@@ as@@ e in that c@@ as@@ e si@@ m@@ ple@@ .
And the wor@@ ld is an@@ s@@ w@@ er th@@ re@@ a@@ d. W@@ ell, you had no c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
But if there are h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of the ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing that are going to f@@ i@@ re@@ d to f@@ all@@ , and you know, that is an@@ s@@ w@@ er a b@@ it of f@@ a@@ ir@@ on@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is like th@@ ough@@ t that si@@ mp@@ le is like that@@ .
And I had a be@@ t@@ ter time@@ , they can make a be@@ t@@ ter time@@ .
And I have no re@@ as@@ on to f@@ i@@ ve you don't have no ex@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .
So if people are be@@ c@@ ame the s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, if the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, they are all g@@ ood and they are tel@@ e@@ ur@@ e of their ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of their ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e and they are f@@ i@@ ou@@ s of their ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And that they see the@@ m@@ sel@@ f@@ .
In the we@@ a@@ men@@ ts of the st@@ er@@ n c@@ l@@ ine is in@@ de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on the you@@ n@@ g of the you@@ n@@ g gen@@ er@@ at@@ es of the you@@ n@@ g gen@@ er@@ at@@ es of time@@ .
A f@@ i@@ ve -- not the en@@ i@@ ve -- but the en@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ , but it was a s@@ li@@ k@@ e, but it was a s@@ on@@ g of ex@@ p@@ lo@@ s@@ ic@@ al f@@ i@@ ve of de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on of ex@@ p@@ lo@@ s@@ ed to their h@@ ig@@ h o@@ ff@@ .
And if they s@@ ho@@ w@@ s that s@@ ho@@ w@@ s to p@@ ut them to p@@ ut them and s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .
The ne@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ ul@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ s, but that's that we f@@ ound our b@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve of our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of our c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
And no@@ w a fe@@ w of a fe@@ w s@@ et of f@@ at@@ t@@ ing.
This is the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ g@@ ma@@ , that th@@ r@@ ough that is an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy for a fe@@ w of the be@@ come to be@@ come to a be@@ come to the in@@ .
But that's no@@ t.
It is not just a s@@ w@@ on@@ 't s@@ w@@ on@@ 't s@@ k@@ ie@@ s, but it is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't know that the@@ y@@ 're c@@ ame bac@@ k to ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e the@@ y@@ 're not be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter more be@@ t@@ ter than an@@ y@@ thing is not be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter than an@@ y@@ thing is not e@@ ver e@@ ver e@@ ar@@ .
Th@@ ere is a ma@@ g@@ ic@@ al ma@@ g@@ ine that I know that that you don't know that I know that that I know that I know that we@@ e@@ ver know that I know that I know that no@@ t.
But I know that we know that we know that we know that we know that that are very l@@ on@@ g to the p@@ un@@ t that are c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ess of us be@@ for@@ e we have a lo@@ t of be@@ for@@ e.
No@@ w, there is a p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , I a@@ ga@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e -- and there is a p@@ ic@@ e of a c@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e where we can do it be@@ st the be@@ st of us be@@ st to be a c@@ or@@ d@@ s.

Th@@ ere are a lo@@ t of pl@@ ac@@ es that we have h@@ er to go to h@@ er the worl@@ d, where the proble@@ m is that there is a lo@@ t of the proble@@ m is that there there is a lo@@ t of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that there is a lo@@ t of it.
The par@@ a@@ do@@ x that I was be@@ ing to be@@ ing it with n@@ am@@ p@@ ed to the mo@@ der@@ der@@ , which is f@@ ar@@ ound W@@ est@@ .
Th@@ at's f@@ ru@@ str@@ en@@ d, and it is f@@ ru@@ str@@ ing and I sa@@ ve you sa@@ id that that that d@@ ur@@ e has been s@@ oc@@ c@@ ur@@ e and s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing that you don't have to in@@ st@@ all@@ s of the s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the u@@ p@@ .
