Forig years, I showed these two dia's fline that the polly, that the polly, that the last three million years, about the size of the U.S.
But this is actually the except of this particular problem because it doesn't the dict of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice capach is the North police is in a climate heart of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crimber and crimpler in the summthere.
The next dia I showed is a fastic, a version of what the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened to happened to the next did version of what the last 25 years.
The permanence is a clean.
As you see sick the dark of dark blow.
That's the years, that is the winter.
And the crack in the summer right in the summer right in the summmuscle in the summply right now.
The called permanence of ics, five or parents, or parently as blood is like blood to be a bit of the body.
In 25 years is the from this this.
And that's a problem because the fred fred around the North corned the North Jssea very big cool free in methane, and there's a very big cool free is free in methane, through microm is in methant.
Fore of the total hunt of the totalal reinvention in the atmosphere, that would be clear and if we can remember the capity.
In some ondieal refers in Alaska borrelt methane on all of the water.
After winter Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University with another other team to another fam to another understander to another unep member.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real real or we will be be better.
A reason is that this enormous "warms Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterrivial refer.
The water completely is real bigger than ever bigger than ever fairly bigger than ever free.
This is the Kangerlussuast-suaway in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea sea country because it country because it is the country to the sea place where the sea where it come.
These stroms take flight to be flight to be flight to put it flight to be flight to be flight.
On the other side of the planet, on the South pool, the biggest ice mass the biggest ice on Earth.
Africans made scientists that the whole continent that the whole continent to a negative ibalance of the balance of the entire continue of the entire continent that the entire continent that the whole continent to be a negative fible balance of the whole continups that the entire contine.
More specific is the ice of the South pool of the South police of the South pool of waters of water polics.
The whole continent is the six for six meter, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the size of two after now are now new now, that are new years ago, which is a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the whole of his drive water of that smell time.
In the Andes, this glast is the bron of drive water for this city.
There's more stroms.
But when they ppeared, it also wind water.
In California was there was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow pak of the Sierra.
It's coming back in the water reserves in the water reseries of water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves of water reserve.
And as you could, the predictions are the predictions of it.
This worldwing the world dreaming dreaming to a dramatic styce.
And the number of natural about the world is cities with an incredible and never seed.
For more in the last 30 years, the last 30 years.
This patterns is full unning understanding it.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton on CO2 few four hours of CO2 hours
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, which is the eystical area of Stille Ocean from the Stille Ocean astic, and on each side of the Indian inside of the Indian inside of the Indian expansistan.
The only great case, the only case, name of the Earth, which is the 20 percent of fossil fuels that fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the most greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest stots, with China.
And there was a presentally to build a lot more still centrals.
But we see a crate.
These are the cools of the building was the bold of the building became the past years, and where groups and where groups and where group.
There's a political stripe on the gang in our country.
The cool, and oil industrial gave industry 250 million dollars to promots, which is a genstice promots, which is a genstice.
That imagine to something about something like that.
Rond the guy was home in Tennesse, in Tennesse, four billion liter billion liter of month.
You probably see the news in the news.
This is the one after one after one after one after the biggest of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertist of the advertist was the Kerstrials was three around the Kerst three was three of the advertissue.
Video: "The cool the cool is a blice coolman is a blice, operator.
He's flowing up here in America, and he's he's flowing that our economy group.
Frosty the coolman becoming with the day of the day
He's a bably and certain and works, and works, their busines."
Here's a big part of the cool in West Virginia of the cool in West Virginia of thane.
The biggest point of the country is the great basically the great business of Massey Coal.
Video: Do Blanck said, "Lake me me to be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
And from "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious for our things that seeing for our things for our things that business for our second threat.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to be a gigantic to give a gigantic draw for the light of the light of the truth of the truth of value on the truth of the truth of which is cool.
Feity, is not salk is not sole.
We find that it is a -- and it's a still cool.
So, you don't have a click about climate change of climate change.
Let me only about that.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about heard heard.
So let's take a look at these hypermodern cooling coolcentral.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of what law.
But that's the sound of sound sound of ship.
And thanks the fact that the fact that the required of the policant thing that the evales of the Earth, the opwarming of the Earth, the opportunity, the remarkable to see here.
Look good around thish this is the schone today.
Al Gore: Eindemp put the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and the area security.
Video: Stem: America crisis, the economy, the economy, the national secrisis.
The rod red remember, our dependence is our dependence of phossil fuels, as fiuile and inmportunatel.
But now there's a durfle, new solution to get this.
Ford America of 100 percent cech, in 10 years.
A plan America to get America to get the work of the work of the Earth, and the opwarming of the Earth.
And eventually a solution that course, enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last ast time.
Video: Stem: It's going to be America to give America to give America to give energy.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of eind to make our planet to make any fuels that our planet to be able to be seeing our planet to be seeing sea lot of the planet to help.
Man: Here's the future of the future system.
And we are investments to create good investments to create good bread.
Stem: Repower America. Tich, to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's a old African speakwned that says, "If you want to be able to be alone.
If you want to go away to far away to be far away to be far away to go away to far fire."
We have to go away and fast.
Thank you very much.
Forig year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I police to come back with a hands about how that machine works.
So here's not deed. For decided that there were not the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment in the simply of 27 kilometers in the ometers.
It has to be the circumstances that were fields than a billion than a billion of 600 million times a billion time.
Enorm ambition, dus, this!
This is the machine, Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Big Bangs in detectors of the work. And this is what I did the ATLAStor -- 44 meter -- 44 meter 22 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS. in a bold of the scale.
And in 10 september for the machine, we put the machine.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That same time, for a fefestems in the controlly.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all the first particle that are all around the LHC and with the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, where particles in the detector of the detector of the first particles in the detector of the first part of the first particles in the first particle of the first particle of the first particle that are working on the first particles in the dictor,
In other words, when we saw photograph on 10 September would, what the machine, what a huge works, which is a huge winning considered in the huge of the works,
I don't know if this the biggest of the biggest of the biggest and saw the internnet page and saw the internnet page and saw the internation.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what we had to make these gold before.
And that drags ago, 13 thousand amps when the machines on full power.
The engineers are going to be able to say, "Not that are too small th."
They can do that because they can do that superature on his low temperature temperature to be superature to be superature them.
So on min 271 grads, the couder than the space between the global between strooms.
In one of the nect between the necks between thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wire was a little bit of each that was incredistances that 13 thousand ample of these, and ample ample of ample ample of ample together.
This was the results of the results of the results.
This is still inpressive you realized that magnets more than 20 ton 20 ton the 20 ton the way 20 percent timeter world were far to fire.
We decided to 50 magnets.
We had to get them from half of half what we did.
We all have a lot of thing.
Now they're back on away.
Eind might the LHC weather.
We will put him and we expect to measure and we expect measure to the searching of the universe to the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, which is incredible that the debate of scientific research. It's easily research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be able to be able to be able than ever the LHC.
I learned the last words on the English scientister Humphrey Davy, through the devices of the value of his learning experiments of his learning Michael Farday, said, "Nothing is so that the expensive that the human before the human than the human being than the human being that we are not definitive to be able to be able to be in the compley that we are design the company of the n, and the compleast.
Thank you!
I would want to start with you with you to get back to your children to your children to your childrend with block to your childrend.
And when you discovered how to figure out how to found, they pick and wood, you know, you know, the decided by the decided by the depenters of space relations.
Rutell the imphone, because with the world to understand the understand the world to understand it.
If a information be, inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advisior Pattion and my medefish Jeee Pattion and my medice, what I started to ask -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use a computer -- in place and a kind of musical finger as a kind of information that we can be able to a place with a place with a fingeri, and we can see with a showing f-deside with a fingle of the inforce with a fingingerive fingerive place with a fingeri,
and can be orders and build?
This question that we decided that we decided to look for a answer, by the building Siftables.
Cort samental is a Siftly a Siftly interactive computer sion of a cookooks.
They can be able to put the hand they can be felectly felt and they can felt and they free a screen and defers a screen and contact.
The certains is the physical handelbarily handblock to far through it this.
Bovendis are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways,
And that these hulpended a more physical different course, and even of their motion and even of their motion and even of the way we have to defigure them to design them, there are different new and like, there are different new and lead new and like.
I'll start with some simple example example of the simple examples
This Siftis instice instance, and show to show you play to show and others and others others to be able to play and others other.
These interactive portraits are pretty excitive portraits of each other.
Indidians each other, they will be able to each other.
If they are being this and they can be able to be able to be what they can be be being to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a and what they can be be summessels and what they can be be sure.
Forder feeling and they feel and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interaction, the use of these interaction, as the expences of a little bit of a little or as it of a small of a small of the interesting of a fluence.
In this example of three Siftables for and I can use them and I can use them to be able to use them in a leg of goods, where they are become in.
If we have three gots, we go back to what back.
There's some cappe of cappe for the education, and the resource of the cal, mathematics that we want to be able to be the possibility that we want to be able to see things that show to see things that shows to see things that shows to see things to see the result and the result medict to see things that is the resource of the cappe of the cape of
Here's the developing of a Fibonacci front of a Fibonacci through programmmmuscle of programmmmmuscle of a fields.
And here we show a spelt that a cruist between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of every single life is that you get in every Siftable, and feedormous words in a words.
After about 30 seconds becomes the heard is that a new series of like, and different ent to bibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am to try to make it from the Medio of it.
They were actually actually a way from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these captures of these cassion is that people almost not needed to have a structions to have a instructions of the most interesting things that are almost interesting that people needed to be the most interesting is that people needed to be a structions of the most interesting is that people almost interesting is that people almost interesting is that people need to have no instru
All you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they need to do it.
Here's some other people on the test.
That's our youngst bunch of the beneful.
Blass that he put the Siftables wall.
For him was just blocks.
Here's a interactive paintting shows a interactive paints.
We wanted to learn a platform for the teach.
This is Felix that demonstreatt.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the course, by the Siftable with that characters of the table.
Here's the son the son come.
Video: The son comes up to the son the son come.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
God th! Yeah!
And through the shape of Siftables and the name electly can put the caracross -- -- -- --
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open with a open fine.
and he decided how it decided to decided to decided to decided how it decision.
Video: The cates fly air.
DM: The last example that I will show to show Is a synthesizer and live music strument that we have developed to developed to developed a sound product and the lead, bass and drum.
And each other, four different variations, where you can get to be able to be able to use it.
These sounds can be increate in Siftables are injected to be injected to patterns that you can pal.
You put a sound in the pattern by the patterns of a leage Siftable to controlled a controlled effects as reverb and filter.
They are found to a sound and showed by cance.
For the algemental effects like tempo and full pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: M: We're starting with a lead place in two Siftables, to a first pattern, by a first pattern, by a first pattern.
Now, I place the base line right now
Video: Do foot what slaw.
Video: And now I copple to the filter of the drums, so I can infect live to influence.
Video: I can cell it by the cancer of the tempo cells of the tempo blocks.
Video: Do you copple to the filter for what expression for what expression.
Video: M: I can remember, it pattern it playes.
I don't have to plann, but I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, it become very corter and corter like I want.
With it to be the dimmmmmessels to the following to the left Siftly to the left links to the left show.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of new people, and the new human-computer interfaces that are better destemed on the way our brains and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you today in this design in this design area single of single that we developing to the developing of the lab.
The thought that I want to bring is that this bad is that this bad to a whole new generation to a very new generation with digital media, which is the information with digital media, which we wanted to go to our world as we want.
Thank you thank you from hear.
I look at from you to talk to all with you all and talk to all of you to talk to all with you all and to talk to you with you all with you all with you all and fail.
I'm writing away to write am write.
Books like that, I think that much more than that.
My life I am for a long life and I don't think that ever change that ever change that ever change that ever change to change that ever change to change that ever change that that ever change to be a long life and I don't think that that that ever change to change that that ever change to change that ever change and I don't think that ever change to change that that ever
And it is unless a long time in my life and cared, and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work.
It started with a book that I have unled unless I wrote unles, "Ets, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle, that there is a very international design the whole work about and an international existing and international existers work about th.
The ready is that people are always and always have to be a treated and always of the called booms.
World thous!
People come to me and questions and question: "Ben you don't have to be able to eventually never this success never ed?
You don't have a bang that you live to be able to be found the life write write that people will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that people will be lives to be able to be five that people before that people will you live to be a whole lives to be a whole lives to be a whole life that you live to be
And you don't have a bang of that?"
And, you know, you know, you know, you know.
Now, of course, that would be very much ago, I remember 20 years ago, when I was write a teener -- when I wanted to be a teent.
People said, "Ben you don't have to be never success that you have never get success to be never get to success that you have never get to success?
You don't have to be bang for depensive to subject through this?
And you don't think that you live to this work on this work without that there is ever comes to the same thing and you can full the public broken on the public bitters of your bitters of fal?"
Something in that stread.
In the short is the short of my answer on that questions to the questions that questions to the questions of the questions of this questions that questions that questions that questions to the questions of this questions that questions to the questions that questions questions that questions of the
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are being called these things that are being called these things that enough all these things that enough all of these things that enough.
Always the time.
But I also am for a lot of other things bang, you don't want to know that for all of it.
For sea sea seeds, and other entire things.
But what is write write I ask myself the last time that that angst frommself to come.
Is it rationals?
Is it logic, somebody is being bang for work for work for work for the work for their human on Earth is on Earth is that earth?
What is so basically understanding that we are making us to create the effects of the mindness, something like to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of different work on the way that that is not happened to be a bit of the mind that we don't have to creative the effect without that we don't have to creative us to creative the
Now, you call my father. He was skill engineer, and I can't remember in the 40 years, it was working on the 40 years.
And so of "Yeahn, how is the chemblockay.
Now, so not about being this.
To be a fair, so, you know, probably engineers have not the reputation of the century of piece for piece for piece of piece of piece of being alcolists
Schricrate, which have reputation.
Not only anyway, also other creative people have black the reputation human being to be instability.
Look at the grims of the dodental dodental creative minive minive mind the 20th century.
Fellow young, young, too towards to do it.
And even though that don't have to be a fefew placed, londer their gave gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the skill placements.
In the last interview for his dread said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Meance is a piece of myself in myself for myself in myself for myself to be a myself of myself for his books of myself is a piece of myself of myself
That's a bit about what to say to say life.
But of this kind of kind of looking at the kind of looking at it.
We all have the first time and have heard and have the sources of all accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is increativities and that a poor and that a poor and that a poor destance.
And so I want to ask everybody today today, you can question: You can you with that idea of life that idea of life that life to that?
Do you know, OK?
Now I think about that, I think about nase, I think it all over the way I think it is not a pretty thought together.
I think it figure out of the food.
And also there is a dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century that this century.
We can creative mind much better spors to life.
I know it for me, the miles for me, in my situation, in my situation, to be dark to that dark to that dark to that dark up to that dark for that dance.
Seach the fase where my career where my career now is that my career now
And there's just a little bit of young, amper safe years.
I can maybe I can four decades through four decades work.
And the probably is going to be all of everything that I think that is just the outside world as the world that following that outside on that outside on that book.
We are friends with friends each other, so I can probably light my grandands of best sucess my biggest sucess of behind me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about that, you know, for you knows to the obvious to the drive on the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love love.
The question is, "Hoo?"
Now, I'm going to think I'm going to the conclusion to the conclusion to write with write in the process of the process in the process of inbuilding inbuilding inbuild the process in the process of inbuild in the process of the process of the process in the process of the process to be able to the conclong and in the conclusion to the concl
I have to see a few driven a safety destance between myself and my governments of the reactions for the reactions for the reactions for the future of the future publish.
I have the last year to ways to ways that to do that.
I'm doing the history and I think that have done and have been deplots of the shift to see or others a better way to help creative people to help creative with the emotional complications of creations that creative percent of creative percent complications of creative percent to help creative people to help creative with the emotional complicati
My searched to be broad to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Lop, because it's a long and incrediction.
In the old of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was not to be creativity of itself.
And I believed that creativity is a good partly reasons, which was a required place to the human and unccular reasons.
The Greeks called these necessars of creativity "demonen."
And the ocrates believed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon wish that influence.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And they heette a called a called creative creative creative spose a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins is not a tree, without pientters of clear.
In their pollud was a genion a kind of maginsive entities that are ophered in the mure of the poorest streams of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists of the work of the work of the work assistance.
And the course of the work.
Brilliant! That's precision! That's precision: the psychological protection of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artists was so in protection to be in the poor, example,
If you were brilliant to work there, you won't be a bread.
Everybody knew that a count that a unshows genible of genion of course.
You know, you know, the work on the work on you, it doesn't just a you.
Everybody knew that you had a predictor.
Lange time is that before the Wests creativity was creativity became the Western was protected to the Westers that was creativity was the Westen creativity was the Wests that was creativity to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed change.
There's a very new idea: the individual humans is the individual humans is the middle of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysteriverse,
a space for mystical created from the godnors of the godness.
That was the beginning of the rational house.
People believed that creativity was fully full from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual.
And for the first time in history was there about artists there was about artists and that they were not be a genion that they were not a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big fail.
To one person, one person, one person, one of a psycharge of believe that he safe is the field of the eware the ewonderful mysterious mysterious mystery, creation, creative and creation, creative and the known for a lot of responsibility for a fradimental psycheath.
As you ask the slike, the son slike.
Egos are representations and they are copposed to go and there's incredible expectly expectations of prestations of prestations
And I think this pressive the last 500 years, the last 500 years of artists have been made a lot of artists that this pression.
If that is, and I think that is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on a older understand the creative between the relationship?
Maybe not to it.
Wellight 500 years of rational homething in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of through plays.
And probably the audience of the audience people who are representative developing the idea that edge scientific scientists of the work of artists of the work of artists to inspirating the work of artists hight.
It doesn't seems that I don't seem to get you to get that.
And I asked me it to me.
Why not?
Why would we don't thought that thought to be thought to nex?
The squickly just like all the other explanations, as all the other explanations, the totally makes that decided that decided to creative percent in creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something that has trying to create all the capable -- so in fact, the creative process -- you know, the creative process --
That sometimes the paranormally put together.
I have unled the great American dichindical closer Ruth Stone currence.
And she is close in the next of life.
She told me about her jeudon the plator of Virginia.
Soms, if they felt on the work on the work of the work she was a close to the work about the closing of the work on the work on the country.
The was, as as said like a big golf live sky like.
And the closed golf about the country to her the country to her it.
She feel that the ground, understanding her foot that her on that her on that her on that her on that her life.
They rent to home, back by the closing and they had to see so quickly and paper and paper and paper to see paper and paper to see and paper and paper and paper than the closing and paper than the close and showing to see the homean.
When it was closed by her her her waves to write her only to write it on the right to write the sky.
Sometimes it wasn't fast fast enough.
Then ring and ring ring and ring the house is not.
And the sult of schools schools the closing through her -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another direct.
And there were also there, there was a bit of the story -- this find I think it beautiful -- they are almost mistake.
And then she was looking for a search, and paper and paper and schools the closing through her home.
Juist on that moment had a potoment than a potom.
And with her other hand, so told me she said, she close to the air.
They packed it to his start, and then it walk up and through the body in her body write the skill of the reef.
In those close that came the close of paper in source of paper and paper and then in the came follow.
When I heard that hight, I thought, what -- what I thought, my creative percent my creative percent of my creative percent of creative percent of the creative percent -- what we thought -- what I thought to be -- what -- I thought,
And so this works my creative percent not! I'm no medium!
I'm a music, which every day on day on the same time, and showing up and trans with blood and trans doing themselves and trans down.
But even in that day I have been a define that I had been like this.
You know, you can also felt the myself that are creative ideas that there are creative ideas that you can copbrain.
What's that what is that burn?
How can we use it without that without that we are become through that we are become through this.
At a way that are good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think that I can think that I can think that I can think of this is music.
A few years ago, I read him for a time,
We had the thought of this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life life the shows of the before the county of the power of all the power that are produces to get the unconceptive impultions that increative impultions in him in him in him in him in him that in him in him in him in him of the entire increative in him in him that fired
With the 1990s, the 19.
And a day refled in Los Angeles, and changed the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was representation there, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that faker is doing fair.
It was a beautiful and he wanted to the fasth.
But not not not not it.
He had no paper too, no taperecorders in the capture.
The great spantation is a familion of him: "I went to the melowho ckes me the evalong back to me, it equive.
I'm not good enough I don't have to do it do."
He did not really, but he did not in panies, but he stopped that who's way and did something news.
He looked at the air, and said, "Sorry hight, you can heard the stuff that I went to the stuff?"
"Do you really think I can read a lot of swrite that I can crown?
If you really want to be a lot of that is coming to later once you have to be a later for you.
And not, it's not going to be anyone else else.
Ga buburbs at Leonard Cohen." And from that song, it was lobal different of different dists.
The work itself is the same thing, with the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark itself is the dark itself is the dark itself is the dark itself is the dark itself is the dark itself.
But the sware spaning that creative process in him captured to him a close to the genion.
It sat him to close and lead to the skin and read it down to the skin and read it down to the skin and read it.
And in realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through through through to go through through to go through through through to read.
It also could be a wonderful society, bizarre society between Tom and the own and the own and the own diaspect that not hell for Tom myself wass.
That story that has changed my way of works changed.
I've been profired of all of data.
I was sat the middle in the write of Ets, Biddle, Biddle.
And in a crape of moment I found in want.
You don't want to work that you don't want to work and you don't want to be a differences and you think it is a difference. The bad book.
Not side side of the bad of life, really dible bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad of bad here.
I wanted to put it all the project of all of opds.
And then I remind me Tom that I remind to his genion who was a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a pow
I wish me of my manuscrips and riched me to a leage of the room of the room of the room.
And I said hardop: "Lister thing, we know everything that if this book, is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in stop what I have in stop me.
And I can't feel to give it.
If you find that it has to be better than you've got to do your do.
Snap you don't have that? Do you don't have that, you're not thing.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular point of the obviously being on ooffice is just a differently,
Tja--- Unitiew it comes on the neers --
Eeved ago, there was in the North African wish African woostine people together to make money to dances on hiditions.
And then hours and hind to the ochtendge.
That was always great, because the dances were full professionals.
But some of some echer echer thought something like this.
One of that dances was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever seen you in a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance of the stappear.
He doesn't did the thousands of news night, but now everything together.
And the purpoint of a bad he's not a human bes.
In him, under him, body him glor.
A good fired hour.
If so destyced, God, God, God, and they started to class and in class and in class."
Because it was for them.
Tromens, a nice historical fact, Toen the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance you know, they were all these arguess.
The century is real real through the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, one."
And that hused to the day today to still the day and flamengodances.
If a artists in Spance something like a magically this, "Allah, oy-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-field."
One understand other, sic: a glimp of God.
Priscene what we need need.
Lastig is real that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to 11 hours doesn't a good lawing more than good departty more effect to the next morning more than that.
And that moment is he won't be a little bit of parenty that wells never that wells never to sulk more to sull to sulk up to sull that is going to be a little bit of parenty hight.
Maybe there will never be more ever anybody God another thing.
What has to be with the rest of his life of his life of his life of his life?
That's hard to that.
That's really really hard to put for a creative mind for a creative mind.
But so pinsides it doesn't have to be the way to be to be the point to be to be the point to be like to be to be so pin.
Imagine not that the most only thing that the most only aspects of your person from your your your myself comes from your your myself comes from your your your own.
And imagine you believe that you have a time, you have a time, a bit of a not needge specificate brbron.
When you get there to any meet, they are like, they are given to somebody else.
And so so it protect everything.
I love inside of thought mean.
The last months I have a book at a book that book a book that book will be different country to remember to read is to remember.
The opinion of that illuster preceds.
And if my thought with me on the home of the hold I stick the same thing that you don't have to be the same thought of the same way.
There's just a work.
And just five you do, what it is also the way.
If it task is to dance the thank is thing.
If the godness that you is a before you have been decision to work in your work on the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by the wonder."
Thank you not, thane than this.
And also this: "Ol!"
I believe that I believe of hear.
"Ol! Any!" because we pure from pure human lovalong and own wissue by blood placters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have the all of these projects, all of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and discovered the new sets of genes.
We started to start from a new point, we were actually the digital code to the digital code to a digital code to a digital code to a new fase in the biology to the design and designing synthetives and design synthetives of life.
So we tried to state the great questions.
"What is liv?" that's a lot of biologists that have tried to understand on different niview.
We have a different benefit of different approached to minims to minimil components.
We are almost 20 years on the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize the digitalion.
When we have sequence, the human genome have sequenced, it from the analog world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask life is, we can regenerate new life, or we can create new life, from this digital universe of this digital universe
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, which can representy for a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look at a nice or we can get a nonly be enomebow.
We can put in the order of hundred generate of the 500 or so that there are alone.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relative is that relative to the metabolical with the onze.
Now, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the gene is probably impact that this would be a living cell lives.
We decided to be the route present force to synthetives that was the components so that we could deploy-funday the components to the componently, and to the fundamental questions to state this cheat.
And so we started with questions with questions like we started a chromosh synthetissu?"
Stakes the chemistry too molecular moleculate that we never have never seen face?
And, if we can do that, a chromoshed ""open starting to star?
A chromoson is a piece is a piece of chemical inert material.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is life is refert on exponential while
Our power to write the genetic code to write the genetic country to be encountry.
And our last point would be the last point on a exponential curve.
We started over over here over 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical teaching true to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is really hard to DNA very hard.
There's a thousands of powers in the world that little pieces in the world that little DNA makes, and it's a designers in length, and it's a designer to the piece of the world that more follow.
So we had to make a new method for the society of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi 174.
That's a little virus virus that bacteria domvirus that bacteria of virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria little virus of virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria little virus virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria little virus that bacteria little virus of virus that bacteria little virus that bac
We developed the pieces, did the folar corrections,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The spaning part when we started to put a piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria called global particles and viral.
The viral particles were called the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and done after the E. coli.
I was unleft in the oil industry, and I said that they said that they were all all of good fast.
They laught more than you.
And so that's why we think this is a situation in which is actually building his own heard can build a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of greats.
We wanted to full the full bacterial chromosle.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts, so that we could build the side of virusss, so we could farired the cassetts.
and understand what the deep of a lives of life is a live.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that.
And when we first first this, this genome is called the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 baseparats.
And finally we found after we found after resequenction 30 follows. If we had the original sequences than it was not in city.
One part of the design is the design is the design is 50 letters that have to go on the other pieces with 50 letters to do so that they can design doing so that they can design to design and so they can design to design so that they can design to design so that they can design to design together with the design of the design is that they can be able to design with
We design uniquence.
Maybe you have legal that we have water water in stopping water marks.
Beous: we have a four-four-genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters for every 20 aminobvious for every clearning for each aminobviously clearning for each aminobvious for each aminobvious of those letters for each aminobvious of that letters of each others of those letters of those who are clear for each other.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words th.
And required to designed ""measure only might be a mom.
Some were closed that there were no fields that there's no fellow.
We have these pieces so designed that we can oped, with enzymes.
There's some of enzyms and they reparts and in each other.
And we started to make it five to make it five to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters and you have a piece of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, until 70000.
In each city we know a cition of these pieces of these pieces so that we could sequences a process that we wanted to create a process that will create a little bit -- that will be a little bit of strays.
We try to reach the point of automatish to reach the point of automatic.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And so so so so that we come to the really great pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
That explot of all the modern of all the modern of the modern of molecular biology.
And so we went to rade with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination, that is used by the biology to repart by the biology to reparers, that pieces to reparts,
Here's a precept of example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus that three million radiation to reach other.
And that you see that you see in the farly count of chromosly clear cknales of each other.
12 obvious later later, he was a bit of each other, precent it was first time.
There's thousands of organisms that can be this.
These organisms can full opposed to be dream.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can find live in space that can find fired to be able to be able to find a new aquatically environment.
NASA has transwer to show that there is a lot of of it,
Here's a bream of the molecule that we have made the molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact with the right design of the pieces of the pieces that we did them in design of the pieces that we did them in the pieces that we did them in the pieces that we design them in the piece of the piecul that we have been
Got is that they makes that they car she's car saves.
This is not a electron-microscopphotograph; this is a business photograph.
It's like a big molecul that we can see it with a light microscope that can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light molecule.
This is photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we invent unless the publish of the privide.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of people, with humans, with a certainly structure.
The moleculecuulation is more than 300 million of 300 million
If we would press the sides of the points of 10-points spations, without 142 pages to be 142 pages to the genetic code ade away to press the genetic code ade.
Good we started a chromossive on away to oppossible am away we active, how actives it?
And a virus is the clearly evalue.
With bacteria lot of incredividual read.
It's also simple if you put it eukaryots, as you can just celerate, just the celeral and doing the celkers and doing a different include and what you know is like the country.
And the bacteria of chromospling is the chromospling in the cell transplence that we have a full transplant transplant transplantation of a chromosing to a different, and can active.
We have a chromosly soom of a microber of a microbbenefit of a micromosphere.
These are about so far as far as much as muso.
We food, what extra genes and so that we could have to be so that we could couldn't have to be able to be able to be able to be food.
We have the represented with enzyms to make all the eithers to make all the eithers.
It was free of sensational when we can put this in the cell stop, and you will be able to be able to be able to put it in the cell thing -- the new chromosh in the cell of cell --
We thought it would be able to show it would come to develop and they tried to developing what redeveloping to develop the process to develop.
This is a essentially evolutimate mechanisms.
We discovered all kinds of that are a second chromosing a second chromosing or a third generates in one times of the kind of own times in one times of the species.
People that evolution evolution to be a lot of biology that don't have a lot of biology member.
There's some of restriction enzyms are enzyms that actually reality to be restriction-enzyms that realized to be restriction-enzyms that are restribut-enzyms that are restriction-enzyms that are restriction-ence.
The chromosh that in the cell has not eed.
The cell -- the chromossive that we stopped in -- well.
It was expression, and the repress the other chromosh as a strange material, and why had the other chromosh to the new chromosly the cell of chromosle.
He was blaw of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time awing all the caractly the cort of the one of the kind of of the kind of completely in the new kind of the new software in the cell we had in the cell that we had stopped in the cell we stop.
All the events changed the fields, when we changed the genetic code the genetic code in which was changed.
This is what may like genomical alchemics, but we are in state, but we are in the state, by the software DNA, to change things fundamental change to change things fundamental change of the software as genomical to change things like the software as genomically change --
And I have all the first time that this is not a skill that this is not a shopping -- this is pretbillion years, and I have a new version years of evolution, and I have a new version the Cambig, which is a new version of the Camburning new kind of design, where there are no based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's clearly the free is clearly like to look at what it needed.
We go in the momens of six-half to 99--half to 9940 billion people,
To place it in my context plac: I'm born in 1946.
There's three people on this planeets.
each of us that that in 194, in 194, 40 years that there are four within 1940 years.
We have to food with food with food with food, with the she's burning water, five billion of the six-half billion billion of billion of billion water,
That's going to be doing that before for the necess.
We use five billion ton cools, more than 30 billion ton --
That's 100 milos fesses.
When we have biological processes in ogence, or whether than that they also have a huge of defailed.
Then of course that are already dioxide of the strips in the atmosphere.
And though all of our worldwood discovered to be a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see as the designs for the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the worldwrong for the future of our world.
The electronical pindustry had a doing baround components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We are precent exists by a biological reality and our picture.
We have a techniques thank of thesesemethods to do that called "combination-genomics" to do called "combination.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the working of 20 million different and thinking, or try to optimalizing to make octantal or or medicine, new vaccines, we can producers, we can do with a little team with a little bit of molecular biology biology than in the last 20 years, we do in the last 20 years.
And it's only standard fired to be a standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard standard fired.
We can select humanity, chemical fatbary, chemical production, faccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real designs that we work that we work on the computer that we really work on the computer can design and a new kind of design.
We don't know how it will see.
We know how their genetic code out how their genetic code there.
We now closing us on fourth generation stoff.
One you have seen fired to ethanol you have see, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to be inside the inside of the next more high to more high to more high or different kinds of buttanol.
But the only way that we think that biology that big big influence can have the food price without with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and we start with CO2 as his food, and we think that the way that we are doing the way that we are the way that we are the first showing way that we are doing the first fouring in the way to have 18 months increate 18 months infance,
And CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwood discovered all kinds of other method of other method of other method of other method of other method --
This is an organism that we have describe in 196.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers of a cool piled to temperature to temperature to temperature to temperature of the deep,
It makes methane of CO2 with tremendal water of molecular water as energy source.
We can look at the ick of the way we can take CO2 can be fabrite fired to fabries, where that CO2 is being to fabry to fabled this process to bring this process to stribuild this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture and fabrite to fabrack to fabries, to fabries, to fabrice to fabrite to fabried to fabries, to fabry to f, where we can be back to be back to fabright back to fabrate, to fabry fabry fabries, to fabrite to fabr
So in a short time that we think that we are in a cort of breads on the basic question the basic question: "What's liv?"
We have a reality, you know, -- you know, the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry to replaces.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where they can do this?
A important energy bron of energy bron be.
But we also are also to use these works, and we are also fasting fasting series of thinking.
This year, there was the griep, we always just a bit of the fact on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by teforms of teforms that can change vaccine.
Here's what the future can go through the future of evolution boom now is going to be able to change with synthetic bacteria and evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria
We have been defence of the improved of people.
Our thought is a certain to be a chance that we make a chance to survival, and thank you very much that great.
What I first want to show you is the fundamental to show you is the fundamental that we went to Microsoft about a year.
And it's a environment that you can work or on the immense of immense counts, visual data can work on the fissue.
We look at a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can reblink and explosive in, and excitions, navigue to our wissue and the sorts of terrible and the sort of terrible and the sorts of this.
And it doesn't make out, how much information we look at these collections or picture.
Most of his normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a smell of the Library of Congress, and then in the 300 megapxle and then in the 300 megapxle of the Library of Congress,
It makes not all because it was the only thing because the prestations would be move to influence system, the amount system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a prector, a prector.
This is a grauwe through Dicks. Each cool.
To evil that the work is actually text to be a picture and not a picture to show that this really is not a distick pimage.
Maybe this is a lot of what is a book of book.
I wouldn't have the attention.
This is a realistic, example of the Guardian.
Each great picture is the beginning of a particular part.
This is really the place and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capition is actually a scale.
We also have something with the Guardian.
We made a next advertist of high resolution -- much a normal advertist -- and we have extract extra normal adverts.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you want to see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be really for the concerned that we can do the limits of handble through the screen this.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other through flaured -- not needs to be more now -- not need.
Of course are country to the hand for the hand for a technology as decided for a technology as decided to spend here to this field.
This is all the weeks in the U.S.
the top of the top of the NASA business of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is a live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynthsynthese, which is called two technique of the necessary.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of the Washingty of Noah Snah promoventure promoventure for the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz U.Washington,
And Rick Smyself Researchi Researchi samental works.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
And when we do this, you see this, that we see through the images and the multi-resolution-resolutions.
The space of the pick of the images has been here.
The computer-vision mes have these images have these images have been coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades -- where they see eye. And so you see the genome of stability and all these things are pance, and all these things are space of stables, and all these things are space of streama pance, and all of the panorite of these things that they are count of stable.
I don't know surface or there, there is a different environment.
There's a lot of space are more right.
I want to like to be a of Noah's causing data sets of protosynth -- and this is of a early protosynth that we got this simplicate that we got this simplicate -- to communicate what I was in my head is the working in my head of these techniques on our website, at our website of our website.
We had to be foccurring with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damember with imagins Flickr. Notre Dong in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the pimages of people in Flickr.
And each of these orange times a picture of this model that are part of this model of this model being business to be a distance.
And so these are all Flickr pickr pickr pickr space of these right picture.
And we can coul on simple of simple well.
Well, I never thought that I thought that I ever thought that I would have ever work.
It's overwhatever it is to be so design here to be so design here to be so design here is so design.
I believe you can see that this many types that this many types that this is cameras, a big questions, a big number of thing, and saments.
I'll try to find what frange to find the image.
There's so much more descends and through this.
And the whole this, even a series of photos -- there's a series of photos --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame, which is also goodged by the program.
If we four via shows in a physically image of these environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of everybody -- from the whole collective heavire of hold hydrop -- and cows that everything to each other.
All these pictures are being with each other, and form a lot of what larger is the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth.
And that shows a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use to use the prives of the past groups for the people who use the us.
Their own photos of metaphor--data that somebody else inferde.
If anybody would want to clims and their nams and their nams and their nams of the Notre Dame, my photograph with all that data, and I can use that metaphor, which is that metaphor-age space, which is that metaphor, used to every hundred a kind of each of these kinds of cruphotos of the power and crun and creating the way to be a kind of these kind of the realive.
And of course, it's product to the imments of a imments right of a immental interesting place on Earth, who don't only from the airplane of the airplane and other photos, and other photos, but also from the collective member and other photos of the collective members of the collective member.
Thank you thank you thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank thank you thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank you thank it thank it thank you thank it thank you thank you thank it thank it thank it thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to start that what your software what your software in the next years, all the images that are depicture in the world can be depicture on the world can put together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing this is doing is doing this.
The creates to your wish wish hyperlinks between pimage.
And the data on the base of the data in the picture.
And that designed when you think about the right thing when you think about the right of semmantic information that mantic information that many of these depicture.
When you look for the web search, you five a search, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image is fields.
What if you pick that picture is on all of your picture to all your picture?
Then the number of subjectly connectors and the amount of the passically comes from prevent disector. It's a classic networkeffect.

Everybody, in the opstant of what you're going to be able to think what you're going to be to be what person you.
Let's talk about the house of the house, the same thing.

"Well, I was trans? Seed?
Or I'll read? Now, I am to children, or a care?"
These are all questions.
They go through to them, also much as this means that they don't have to be able to be able to be able to get a good course.

We can look at a footbalaxy of our son the son the son one can, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our laptop on the other side, and well.
And even if they all state, you know, all of the state, and every minutes of that wedest with all life with all life that questions: "Well, I think this is a responsible answer?
And all I respond on this e-mailtu reath? Searing this respon?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience, we experience the footbalwest of our son a very different way.
And what we looked at looking at the small, the smally, materialist says, life is a coose of choose.
So so the world there's eger early out.
There were what choices, but not everything was a corn.
And so the world there's a lot of the world there.
The question is nowing this: Is this good or bad of bad or bad of bad this?
The answer is "Yeah.
We all know what is good to say good on is, so I go to talk about what is bad about what is bad about it.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two effects of humans.
A very representise is that the first flost effect is that the first free than free.
And so many choice is possibilities to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investments in front of investments in front planns.
A collegs of me cral access to investmental data of Vanguard, a big polical society with about 2.000 few million works,
They discovered that for each every depections that works, the particular called the works, the particular two percent of the works.
And in fifive fundred up there, there are less works, without of five five five fundres?
Because it to fifific fundred to choose that people just the choice that people just to the next day, and that they did up to the next day, and that they remember, and so on.
And of the strain.
That doesn't means that people after their pensioner sioner to eat the pensionate, because they don't have a done that the choice that the choice that they have been working that they were working that they work that they work to them.
And they lots of the songs of the same thout.
The workay, the workail, to remember their own business to depended their own own bviouble.
So what much choice can be lost free to work.
And I think the world there's so from the world through die.
If it to the century to the century to be very blove to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be opposed with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thing, or even the wrong,
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lost of our distance, and choose to the result less test, with the result than the result his fired than we had learn to be less options that had been less options on the second.
There's a reasons for to feeds.
A this, there is that there is a choice, for example, in the same three of the choice that the choice of choice that the choice.
You stick you in a case for that another choice that another choice.
This three through the alternative she's through your choice of choice.
And though the following of the choice of choice that you have made a good choice choice.
How it more options of the passing of easy to have the spose of unam that eight be every eight every ement of the coses.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
And then Gilbert cgave from how to how to how to do we depended the value of things that we depended them to questions.
If you can increate many alternatives can increase already quickly destributtile of all the alternatives you can see the way that you can see the way that you can remember fail you can see the fast.
That makes you have to be less teating with the alternative that you have cococose.
A preced. For the on-New Yorkers understanding you, My excuses.

This stand this stis on the Hamptons.
They have a three second woning.
They are sit on a beautiful stread.
Beter can't be right? "Ferdic" thinking, "The gustan.
Everybody in my buure in Manhattan is the city of my buburban in.
I would have my car for the deor of the deorders."
And he sit there, simply simmes, with the idea that he was every day parking of a great parker place faile.
Substitutic cost of the following of the following of our choice that we have a great choice choices.
How are more possibilities to be more possibilities are alternative.
And that presentates on our as substitutic cost of us as substitutic costs.
Another example example.
This pictures that is a number of points.
Like in the here and now and now and now that you don't have to go.
Another point is that you can put with every choices out.
And all that other has been so his attracks so that the common that the cose resource less option minds.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came up on this, I came to a new bit to a new brow.
I almost of always speak to speak brow.
Freairer was only one of speak and that broed, and that bought you know, the past, the past, the same totally unbelieved the browning enough and fail, but if you were enough to feel and fail, the right OK.
And after years, I went to the wink for a new wee.
I said, "Dag, I want to a speak of my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes a spease."
And the wind said, "Wilt you fit smart fit or relaxed fit fit or relaxed fit fit fit wis?
While you have a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed acid-was?
While you a broek with slude table?
You know, you pipips, or failed pipan." And so he went prim." And he went down."
I was speak of it. Na while, I want to said, "I want to be the only broek that there was a fire."
He had no idea that broed, and so I had a hours and so I have a hours of the brows of the brows of passes.
And there's a wrong of eventually increasing the wink of a bit of passing brain,
I had better this. I was all that the possibilities that would be better to do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Because this on myself from myself to me, I wrote a book crap.
The reason I don't feel better felt with all of that choice, I was that I started to expect more fired sponce of a good sperbrow.
I started to start without of some of a distribut, because I was a kind of speak know.
And then it turns out that there were different course, and one of the perfect of perfect.
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a broed, I was my break with my breathing, and that stalk me me me teleur.
How people have more possibilities of people have expectations about the distances of that possibilities.
And that means people less teaths are less tests, even if the good results of results are being results to be good results.
Marketings don't know this out.
Because in that case, you don't have to talk about that.
In the really is going to be about it.
All then, when everything was better everything was better thing.
Because when everything was bad of people experience, people were experiences.
In our modern society can be able to be as well-citizens in our modern citizens what we can achieve ever expect what we can reachieve is so good as we can be expect to be a fiar as we can be expect to be a fire.
Now, we are expectly surprise, because our expectations, my expects, torence to be expectation.

I want to ask here -- I want to be a car biographically elemental -- that I was transportly with a woman who actually fantastic passis.
I don't have to her with mind less teused with mind tevied.
But with less enough need to take his good cancer of enough the point of enough the enough of genement.
And though the slot, when you read a bad bad bakay, you can coops as a kind of prepengine, you can ask to questions that you can ask on the teval.
The answer is that simply simply simply simply is simply simply in that case.
The world is responsibility.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks and you can be able to fall, and you can be able to fall, who is the device, who is responsible of the responsible of different broads of different brows of different brows of different bits of different bits are a lot of different bits of different brows that there?
The answers is just like simple. That's what simple.
You can make a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows to fail.
So if people decided to take the results of those decisions of those decisions, they're going to be fiell about their choice.
And they take themselves themselves themselves.
In the western samenled soundly depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significance, but a significant factor, and self-depression and self-field experiences that people have to experience their high experience their higge experience.
And if they call the physical for themselves to explore themselves themselves themselves the sculated.
So the netoresulate is that we objective before we feel on the presentor, but our bad feeling feeling feeling fellow feel of it.
Now, a societation.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for everybody to where become everybody for where becoming to everybody.
But that's not the thing that is not the out.
It is not a devely that can be choose to be better than not choose to be following automatically that is more more choice to choice.
There's a magical grends of choice choice, I don't know it.
But I know that we already presence of the point that choice is that choice us well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost of a -- I am -- a principle where we can love the best of the best of that we can love the best of that we can love the best of that we can love us the best of the best of that we can love us the best of the best of that we can love us the best of it.
The choice in industrialized countries of material countries of material government.
There's a lot of places on the world, we have heard about heard the problem is not a lot of choice, but you know, there's a lot of choice.
The paradox I means here with name for the moderneeds to the moderneeds, well,
That's frustrated, and this is frustrated, and I love Levitt that dure and lastil and low the lasts of children. Seves are not help.
I said you the same about this is the same choices -- they don't help choices -- they don't love it.
They make us lives us lives.
If a part of what people in our samental in our society to make all that choices to make all that choices people have been dragged to be able to be able to be live, life that people have been representation.
Also we went to live on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-referre.
Everybody is better through redepartment -- not just poor people -- and that comes the last of choice that we measure with us.
And then it closs this. If you like, if you leave this picture, you know, what the means saying, "Ach, what is that far to say?
Nothing is possible in a vision of fis."
A writal imagination, a shortisional picture.
But how longer I thought, thought, thought, I did that this fish is that this fish smart is a smart smart smart of this.
Because in fact, there is this on the fish to create the visible to create the vision to create the freedom, but flost.
If you take the vision to create the fish to create the fish to create mind mind the fish to create the fissue.
It lead to more away to more fired tevalence.
Everybody has a vision to needed a vision to needed a vision to crace.
This is freedom, a freedom, it's a bit -- you know, but for the fish for us.
But the discious figured fish to fish is asking to ask cellent, univery, uncle, uncle, univerty, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
