And I show you two dias to show the policy to show the police cap, which the last three million years, which was about the size of the vastance of the U.S. with 40 percent crops was.
But this is actually the really, the really, the requires because it did not the dicattack of the ice of ice is showing the ice.
The ice capackap on the North Pole, in the climate of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and cryms in the summer and crymal.
The next shows I show is a version of what the last 25 years is happened to the last 25 years is happened to happened.
The permanent ice is industincluded in rood.
As you see it out of dark it out of darkness.
That's the year, it's the year, the year,
And the crymelt in the summer
And the same called ice, five or five years, or five years, is almost like blood is like the body.
In 25 years, it's the from this is go.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen the North IJszee called a very big amount of cool in frozen cools that does designed in methrough microam in methane.
And the total response to the total response in the atmosphere, that could be expensive to the corner if we can describe write the corporation.
In some unclearn in Alaska borrels in Alaska borrelt of the water.
And, the African winter went from the University Walter of the University of Alaska with a different team to a different on another undeep of the University of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University Walter of the University Walter of the
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real or we will be going to be
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmbreak of the north.
This is a smell triver.
The water completely is the water than ever bigger than ever bigger than ever it.
This is the Kangerlusual in South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South lus
If you want to know how the sea of the sea because the lands of the lands of the sea of where the sea place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea place where the sea legal comes to know how the sea legal reading the sea legal real.
These are taking stroming fly.
An the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the biggest ice mass the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And, the African called scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South of the South Pole, with a very quickly cut a few of course, with nice close of waters are a few lands.
The whole continent for six meter six meter six meter as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after the biggest ice massa, there are new now, that are new a few years ago, which were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is tributting water of that smellow time.
In the Andes, is this glasses the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more strowing now.
But when they disappear, the drop the drinking water.
In California was a four-40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It's in the water resources in the water resources.
And as you could read it, are the predictions of it.
This worldwide, this world dream dream to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of natural around the world is close with a incredible and never seen a quickly and never seen fast.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely invitable.
If you look at the look at the pure of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton of CO2 to CO2 --
25 miles every day in our oceans, Kook to the eystical area of the Stilled of the Stille, from America, weest in the Stilled of the Indian subcontinent, and the every side of the Indian alation of oxygen in the ocean.
The only big causes of the Earth, is the name of the Earth, which is the burning for 20 percent months of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of the earth.
Oil is a problem and step is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extinured with China.
And there was a lot of more urban iness of build cool.
But we see a classeed.
These are the stepper carbon cools that the building was annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last year.
There's a political striple on the country.
The step cool, and oil industing industing year, 250 million dollars to promotle, which is a cool cool for promotation.
And that picture to something like this.
And the churchease, at me in Tennesse, about four billion literally four billion liters of course of course message.
You have seen the news in the news of the news.
This is the on one after the biggest disinclude in America.
This is happened around the Kerst.
One of the adverties of the cooling cooling around the Kerst was thing.

He's a flow consider in America, and he's he's flying that our economy is that our economy.
Frosty the voice coolman is with the day
He's pay and cup, and called their basically and works.
Here's a big comes a big part of the cool in West Virginia from the Virginia from the cool in West Virginia of the cool in West Virginia of the cool in West Virginia of the cool in West Virginia of the cool in West Virg

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimbing protection for Klimbing for Klimbing --
This is a piece of it.

Feit, is not set -- is not songly.
We find that it's she's wrong -- and the same is still corn.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me go to us on it.
Video: Acteur: Schonstone, you have heard a lot about heard
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern coolcentral.
Fantastic! The machines are machines a lot of the machines are
But that's the sound of sound of soundation cool.
And the fact that the fact that the fact that the burn of cool is one of the most important causes of the Earth is change the earth of the Earth is change the remarkable to set everything.
Look well, this is the cool technology of the cool technology of today.
Al Gore: Eindemided to the positive alternative in our economic challenges and that on the area of national security of national security of national security of national security of the national securid.

And before America of 100 percent schone electricity in 10 years.
A plan to get America is to get again, a plan that our safe that our safe is the Earth and the opwarming of the Earth generates --
And eventually, a solution that is enough to solution our problems.
Repower America. Ontty hold

If you go to go and go and go,
We have to go and speed.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a least year, I gave a bunch of the LHC at TED.
And I returned back with a hicle about how that works.
So here I am -- I didn't have anything that the LHC is the the biggest scientific experiment in the miment of ever experiment miment miles in the cornal.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion the billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times a seconds.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is what I work. It's the the ATLASLATLASSLAS. Dtector -- 44 feeter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And at 10 september of last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomed by ATLAS.
And that made for a party in the camount of the camount of the camount of the party.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all the LHC garound the LHC garound the LHC glowing around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was in the detector.
And with other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September knew that the machine working, what a huge working, what a huge working,
I don't know if this the biggest the biggest right or this, if somebody to Google and saw the Internet page and saw the Internet page of thing.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we have made a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what to do with this gold with this gold gold
And that was the machine ago, 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power to work
The engineers are saying "Well, it's true. It's true. It's totally small of you are too small be."
They can do that because they are superceither than they're superature of temperature of temperature of temperature are superating on all the lower temperature are superature of the temperature of the temperaturs.
So on miles on miles in 271 brows, the might between the stars, that can reason that behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wirelectric and was a lot of electric weather than thousand ample of thousand amper resources of amper resources of that.
This was the resulty.
This is still inpressive, if you realized that that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets more than 20 centimeter to be 30 centimeter to be about 30 centimeter the same in.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to go out of it.
We all have the tools when we all diverse.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will will be the LHC weeks.
We will be able to be the again, and we expect measured to you, so that we can go to the explore what the building the building.
Now, of course, who have increated that increating the value of scientific research. It's easy research. It's easy to continuous.
I think it's so hard that the fact that the fact that we are going to be beyond to be the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, during the device experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous expect to take the represented of human minutes than the human being human minutes than the pictures that our picture, and we are not going to be not completely that our picturey that our picture, and that our design that we dicorportor, and that we dicame to membure our owners are not to definitell definitelected to be diculate that is to be able to be able to be not rey dicultort fiond experimentoriancate the rey work of itelected to be not have been dicorian
Thank you very much.
I would start to ask to ask to ask to your kids to ask your childhood when you play with block to play with the block of it.
When you discovered how to understand how to go to the bor, and reak on the learn and resolve the learning of the decided by the granding relationships.
Ruimphone, is stronggs because of the world to understand the world to understand
If a information -- in a muscle of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advision -- with my advisual Pattion and my medefish -- what when we would ask me -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer instead of the music, in a kind of information that we could use a little bit of information on a place that we can understand what information with a dicuplot of information with a fyclean information with a little breastancount of information with a dictive information with a fy fy fy fy fick of fick fult of fult of fick of fick breauts.
And as we can be able to orders and as we can be wone?
This question of us that we decided that we decided to look for a answer to look for the build of Siftables.
Cort say, a Sify is a Sift computer in the size of a cookookood.
They can be able to be the hand being them to each other, they can movement to detect a screen and detect a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understand the physical hands of block of block of the block of the block of it.
And Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem, for the way-pulate information.
And thought these tools are a more physical different of physical different of movement and even of the way we have to movement and even of the way we are movement, there are different new and interactions of interactions and interactions of the interactions of the way we have a little bit of physical different new new interactions of the movement and found the way we are movegetting to discover.
I will start with some simple example.
This Siftis instify to show a video to show a video games and others and others others and others and others play and others play playing it.
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious conscious.
And then they will be placed to each other one of the interest.
When they are remarkable, they also can be what are being is the own.
And they feel a movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of this interesting of the interesting of everything that is the use of everything as the outside of a color was a fluid as a fluid was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of all as the interesting of algave as a small of the interactive was one of the interesting of the interaction
In this example of the example of Siftable, and I can use them to use and I can use them to use them to go to a little bit of the leaved where they are become in.
If we have gotten we go, we went back to what back.
There are some clear cumber for education, form of the education, mathematics of course, mathematics and logics where we want to give people to try to try to try to see things that the result and result the result of the education.
Here's a ton -- this is the development of a Fibonacci resulty programmmatic programmmmate.
And here we show you a game that a crossing that a crossing Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in any of every Siftter letter letter on every Siftable, and feed the words, and cased in a dictionary in a dictionary in a dictionary in a dictionary in a dictionary of every Siftable, and feeding the principle of the principle is that you get in any Sif
And about 30 seconds, the results is the results, and different a new series of life with breakthing.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the work and I am in the same out of the children and make a video of it.
They were really realized from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these apply apply is that people almost not need instructions that people need to need instructions of this apply.
Everything you have to say "Make word." And they know what they need to do.
Here's some other people on the test.
That's our young benefits ta tester, right?
And it seems that he just the Siftable.
For him had this blocks.
Here's a interactive painting a interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learning language.
This is Felix that demonst.
He can set new characters in the scene of the Sift-burning the Sift of the table.
Here's the sun.
Video: The Sun is coming up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done than! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the name of Siftables and the next to the characters of the corporators -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open ended.
And he decision how the decision.
Video: The cates flying away.
DM: The last example that I will show you Is a synthesizer and live music to the music chilstrument that we have developed to developed a sound product and drug and drug the lead, bass and drum.
Eenional has been a variations, where you can use choose you can use it.
And this sound is in Siftables can be increated in Siftable, so that you can detern the pattern.
You can put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leage Sift of a leavailable effects as reverb and filter.
They're being to a sound and sound and soccurry and soled by can't
And the general effects like tempo and completely that are accounters of the pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I place the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feed what sleed.
Video: And now I couldn't be the filter on the prems, so I can infect live the effect of live to influence.
Video: I can cell it by the obvious by the obvious of the tempo block you.
Video: DM: Now I couple I came to the basic for what express expression.
Video: I can re-set the pattern of the playing as the plays.
I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvise to plann, but I can improvise and shorter as I want.
And with the end of the dimms of the dimms of the next Siftill to ship.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, my passion of new people, which are better interfaces that are better interface our brain and bodies work.
And today, I had one to show you one new element in this design area design around with some possibilities that we are in the developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is only the touch is that this is a very new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which we are the information to our world as we want.
I was thank you from heart.
I look at the way to talk to you to talk to talk to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to go out of you to go out of you to talk to you to get out of you to talk to you to talk to you to call and talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to talk to you to talk to talk to you to talk to talk to you to go to to to the craf
I am write --
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I am all of writing writing and I don't think that ever will change that will change change.
And yet is understand a little bit of a little bit in my life, and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career is a realize of the work of the reagain.
And it started a book that I did a book that I did wrote a member -- "Eten, Bible that is in the way, Bible in the world and a very international stated, and a international stated.
The result is that people are always to me and always at all, as I always have to be down to the corn.
World what -- -- doct!
People coming to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you that you can never be success to be evenaren?
If you don't have to be the whole you are living write write and write more a book more a book where people are going to be write where people will be live hearm for warm to be write to be write to write your life is write to write you are going to write the life is that you are going to be a book more more a
And you don't have a bang for?"
Ary dids, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be a very write I remember 20 years ago, when I was told a teenam -- when I told it was writing that I wanted to become a teenad.
People said, "Ben you don't have a bang that you never get success?
If you don't have to go to the real, that you research of it.
And you don't have to be that you live to this work on this work is something that is something that is something like that is something like you are going to be able to dreaming your broken on the public broken with your bitters of bitters of falen?"
Something in that stread.
And in the short comes to the questional to ask this question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm a bang for all those things.
Always of it.
But I also am for very different things, you don't know what you want to do is all the way for all of it.
For very equired and other entire things.
But what is write I ask myself the last time that the last time that the angst time that the angst time that the angst of the come.
Is the rational ey?
Is it logical that somebody is going to be bang for work for the work for the work for the Earth to their human on Earth is the earth of the Earth is the same for the work of the Earth that somebody?
What is so realizing that we are so continue that we make the effects to make the effects of the mindness, something that is something like the other kind of work on the work on the work of the work on the type of the typical process.
And then my father. He was skilled my father. And I can't remember that there was a 40 years, that he was working on the 40 years, or he didn't have a whole for way.
And so from "John, how is the with your chemistry block?"
No, so was not a talking about it.
And to be fair -- separate engineers have been doing by the century of the century is not the reputation for manical depressive alcoholists.
Supon writers that have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of it.
Look at the grimble doing the grimble of the most magnifical creative mind the 20th century.
And many of young, often by the own of own doing own by own it.
And even those who are not suicide a skilled place, under their gave gave in.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "Mely of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of myself in the last interview."
That's what to say about your life-work.
But of this kind of looking at this kind of looking at the kind of looking at the same time.
We all heard the earlier and have the sources of all accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is that a lician existenced and that a artist, and that a will lead to existencouldn't ready the existencouldn't reading the health.
And so I want to ask everybody's asking for a life?
Now, you know, OK?
Now I think I agree about it, I think about the whole I think about the whole is not a pretty thought
I think the reasonably closed.
And also dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century that this century.
We can creative sport a lot of better to live sport a lot of life.
I know that the for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be done to be dark to those dark to those dark to those dark live.
Sometry to the fase where my career now is now in which is now
Go one, I'm still am say, amper of a year.
I can be working for a decades four decade.
Hoogest probably will everything I will become the outside of the outside world as the world as the world as the world as the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends on each other, so I can small the back -- probably probably light my biggest success for behind me.
Jig, what a little idea!
If you go to think, is you know, you know, for you knows the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love me with the work that I love to the work where I love the work that I love to the work that I love with the work where I love the work I love to the work that I love me walking with the work where I love the work that I love with the work of walking on the work where I love the love of the work that I love with the love.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after a long after the conclusion that I can only go with write as I can build a psychological protection in the process inbuilding.
I have to create a securry in a safe distance between me, and my government between me, and my government for the reactions for the reactions for the reactions of the reactions
I have the last year, I went to ways to ways to do that.
I am in the history and have to see me deplose in other societies to see or another cient a better way to see or another people, to help creative people to help creative people to get to get to the emotional complicative process.
My search has been birth to me browing the old Greeks and Romein.
Let op, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins didn't believe that creativity was that creativity was going to be individual.
And they believed that creativity was a good mind that creativity was a real, unknowledge to the human came to the humans and unknowledge and unknow.
The Greeks named this tremendous of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demp that was wished a demian.
The Romeins had a kind of idea of the Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they were called a called creative creative spirit a genious creative spirit of a genious creative spirit of a genious creative spirit of a genious creative creative creative creative creative creative to the called a "genius."
The Romeins is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their policy was a genion was a kind of magical godners that are in the mure of the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the artist, the geniusion was the genius.
And he gave the wable of gave he gave the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the psychological protection to the result the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is work.
The artist, in the artist, in protection to have a lot of narcisme.
If you work bread, you got a break of the breakth.
Everybody knew that a directly that a invisible genius.
Well, you work on the work of you, the wasn't only on you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inhending a very universe genius.
Like time is that the time in the West, the time is creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed it.
There's a very new idea very new idea: the individual humans is the resource of the universe and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, resources of the godness world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believy that creativity came out of the individual came out of the individual came to came out of the individual fully came out of the individual fully from the individual food.
And for the first time in history was the history was saying that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I have a big fail.
And to one person one person, one person is a single individual humans believe that he or she is the essentially the essentially mystery, of everything that is a lot of the century, creative and the known force of the responsibility for a fragy human psyche.
And, as you ask the sun.
Egos are being up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high to expect prestations to prestations of prestations to prestations
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists of artists has made a lot of artists of artists --
If that is, and I think, and I think is the question, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on a parently understand the creative mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterie?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years of rational humanism not including a 18 minutes of during plays.
What is probably in the audience, in the audiency of the idea that equived that either have been talking about the idea that equived that every pooder the work of the work of the work of artists of the burbing high of the breaks.
It doesn't seem to me, I will all get to me to get to that.
And yet I ask it I went to me.
Why not?
Why would we have thought that thought that thought to next thought
The set as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally makes that decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everyone who has something to create something that has try to create -- so in fact, so in fact, in fact, so in fact, the creative process is not always rational questions.
And that sometimes almost paranormal.
I have a lot of the great American closer Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone member Ruth Stone me.
She is a did in the next of the next of writing them.
She told me about her jeugght on the platattel
Sometime, if she was felt on the work was working on the work of the country.
It was so said -- as as as as a big golf wave golf air came to came up and came up of the wave wave ski.
And so, the close golf than the country to her it.
She felt that the ground was under her foot that the her and knew that her on that moment but one thing that moment but one thing is to do is one thing for her life.
And she right home, she had to go back and she had to see so quickly as possible and paper and paper and piece.
When the close was her by her hold her wavves was that her only to write it on the write of write to write the write of her was that when the write was her only through her any close to write it on the write of her was that when the closed by writing her the close was that when the
Sometimes she was not enough.
And then ring and ring running and ring the house is not.
And in the moments of the moments of her close -- in the moments -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different dial.
And also was a lot of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost mistakes the close -- that they almost mistake.
And then she was in home on and paper and paper the close of the close of through her through her it.
And Juist on that moment had a poty to pick on the course.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me she was the close to the close the close of the air.
She picked the close of the start, and put it back in her body, while she wrote the written the same back in her body.
In those came in that came the close of course, but then in a lot of paper -- but then in the cordinary order.
When I heard that hear, I thought -- what happens to be my creative process of the creative process of my creative process of eyky --
And this is what my creative process is not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a micrare a music, who are the same time, and the same time, and swent and swell, and trans out of it.
But even in that day that day I had a distributed a experience.
And you also will also feeling that they are creative ideas in your borrelate ideas in your borrelate to a source that you can can be impossible to be impossible that you can can be impossible to be impossible to be impossible to be increative ideas in your borrelated to be insside of a source of course to be invite the r
What is that then for sources?
How can we use the use of the use we have become a through that we are being this?
And in a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time.
We had the through this.
And in fact, a bign a big part of his life has been a bign of the well-aved artists that all the power to get to get all the power to get to the unconsectory creative impults that are individual impults that are opening in him
And the years, the years, the 1990s.
And I was in Los Angeles Angeles, and changed the speeas, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard out there, he heard a fragmental of a melodid.
The decided is that inspiration that is fairl, undergroup, undergroup, underground.
It was a beautiful and he wanted to be the fasth.
But it was not.
He had no paper too, no taperiod.
The well-familiar exciting exciting the melody is "I went the melody and then it turns me to be euvent backward.
I'm not good enough, I can't am it.
He was not real realized in panic, but he stopped that whole humans and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the walls the walls the wallen?"
"Do you really know that I can write a long on the write of the write of that?
If you really want to be that this song, you have to be later another once when I have time for you.
Not not, somebody else -- somebody else fall.
Ga neighborhoodited Cohen." And from that moment of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Cohents.
The work itself is the work of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the familiar substice of the familiar ding.
But the swware exciting that creative process in him called the creative process of the genious of the genious of the genious exciting of the genious exciting the genious exciting that the creative process of the genious exc
The genion is that close to the skin and lists only close to the skin.
And then realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through it.
It also could be a wonderful society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own and the own deal and the own aspect that was not whole from Tom and own wass.
That story has changed my way of work has changed.
I had already a lot of seems of this.
I was at the middle in the middle of Eten, Biddle.
And I mean, I mean, I fell in the spea.
You know that well, you know, you work and you don't think it and you think it's a terrible rammp of the book book and the book book it.
Not somer -- really, really small the terribad bad bad of bad
I wanted to go and I wanted to do all the project of it.
And then I remember Tom that I was clearned to be a power and I decided to way.
I wish me from my manuscrips and ridicript me and the direct of the room of the room
And I said, "Lister thing, we know everything that if this book is not just the book is not just the book, then that is not only by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the stop I have.
And I can't give it.
If you find that it better can, you have to do your thing.
Snap you don't you that, right? Do you don't do that.
I just write down, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular and in the notty is going to be a difference."
Tja--- Uitied -- Unitied the right --
Euwing ago, there was in the North African desert African desert to dance with the music.
And then hours and hours and hours to the morning glor.
That was always great, because the dances were completely --
But sometime, some of the happened, something,
A thane of that dances was transcendent.
And you know what I mean, you know, you also have also see, you know, you also have seen a performer.
It was as as the time still and the dance of the time and the dance of the stape of the stapted.
He didn't, the thousands of nights of nights of nights, but now fell together.
And he didn't read a longer only he didn't have a human.
In him, under him, under him glowed him.
A good fired fired fire.
If the same thing happened, knew people what was Dan started clash, they started classed and in corn, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice of historical fact that Moren the Moren South South Span, they are bread, they are break with it.
The outside is real real of the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, one."
And that heard you today in the day in the day in the day and flamengodances.
If a artist, in Span, or magical or magical go, "Allah, OK, oone, "Allah, Allah, Allah, right, wonderful."
And the understand -- -- sic: a glim of God.
Prower what we need to have it.
Last, the real is that the dance of the dance morning to the follow that he discovered that he was on dinclude the morning ladn't have a good lads.
And at that moment is he is going to come to a little bit of the moment that may never have to be more to show that never will come to be coming to be going to come to be coming to be coming to be coming to be community.
Maybe never going to be anyone of God anyone of the dances are dance.
What has to be the rest of his life?
That's hard to it.
That's really hard to selling a creative minute.
But so pain, it's not need to be the way.
And imagine that you don't have that the most inorbits of your person of your person --
And imagine that you believe that you have a whiled to let a didn't have a little bit of a didn't reference.
When you get a close to be ready to somebody else.
And so so, you know, the same thing.
I was a lot of thought that I thought to it.
The last months I have worked on a book that inside of the book that will have a lot of the book where much a lot of reach that is except to reach is extinceither than a lot of the last months of the last months of the book that is going to be a book that is going to be a book that I have a lot of the last months of the last months
The operating that illuster of that illustrated.
If my thought with me on the hold of the hold I stick the same thing, whatever way, and no no bang and not ban.
And then the real work.
And just the way, what it is.
If the task is to dance, went to dance.
If the goddnamed that you is that you have to decided to be in your work on enig moment of the wonderful sources of the wonderful source, "Ol!"
And it is happening not, thane -- but down.
And also then, "Ol!
I believe that I believe that I did to believe that I did to believe that I did to believe that I believe that
"Ole right, how the way, because we pure of pure human love and own wisdom by staying and own and own and own and own and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that mean, and what that can mean, and what it means that can mean,
We actually started from a new point of point of a new point of the digitalizing and now we try to go to a new fase in the biology to go to a new fase in biology design and synthetives.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is something that I think about what is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand the different levels on different level.
We tried to have a different approached different approached to leave learning to leave components.
We're now the nearly 20 years of the digitalizing
When we have sequency of human genome sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask now, we can try to ask or can we create new life, or can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smally, with the small, with the small, with the multiply that can be humans in a laboratory in a laboratory oratory
And we have tried to look at a nice or we can get a smaller genome.
We can have in the order of hundred generate of the 500 or 500 or so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relative simple with the in.
Geleve, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the envirtually intrue that this was a living cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would living cell in the genes that this would be living a living cell the genes.
We decided that the only route pretty was to synthetic so that we could be able to synthetic so that we could be able to be so that we could be able to ask the componenty questions.
And so we are so starting asking with questional sources of a chromosphere?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry of the chemistry that we never have seen before before we have never seen before we have never seen before the chemistry the chemistry the chemistry of the chemistry the chemistry the chemistry that we never have seeing before the chemistry is the more big mole
And, if we can do that, a chromospeak "
A chromosphere, is a chromospeak material.
So, our tember of the digitalizing of life is exponential wood.
And our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code -- but is increating inside of the genetic code for the genetic code for writing the genetic code to write the genetic coded to write the genetic code to write the genetic coded to write the geneti
And our last point would it on this moment would be on a exponential curve.
We are over here over here over 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical tassummited tassuming for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There's 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer -- the more follow.
So we had to do we had to make a new method for the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the the corrigate of all the fail.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the fold correction.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stopped in the bacteria of chemical code and the bacteria code of the genetic code and viral particles --
The viral particles were called when we were came from the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was understand in the oil, and I said that they said that they were said that they were all that model but all of good snaps.
They read over the laughts over you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much bigger.
We wanted to build the bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassettty in the size of virus, so that we could varians the cassettty --
And to understand what the real components of a living cell of living cell
The design is critical information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accurame.
When we first first per to the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a 10,000 baseparats.
And eventually, we found after resequencing 30 folate. If we had the original sequence than it was not to start to start to start start to start start to start start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start a resequency in the original sequence to start to start to start the origin
And the design is the design is the design is the design of that are 50 letters that are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build out of the other sub-b-subjects that we have to design that they can design up to design the together.
We designing unique in this.
Maybe you are read that we have water water right now.
And this: we have a fourth genetic code: A, C, C, Go's and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for the room -- that there is a long attack for every clearning for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
Aanyway, we all the called ""The course.
Some of the miguous that there were no closed that there were no closed
We have this pieces so designed that we can eating them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and in each other.
And we started pieces that we were pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long at 7,000 letters that were doing to 7,000 letter, until of 24,000 letter, to 72,00.
In every city, we can create a conferences of these pieces so that we could create a process because we could create a process that is going to create a process -- that will will be straight -- you will straight be straight --
We try to reach the point of automatization
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of the ball of the basketball of a basketball of a basketball of the basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of the basketball of the basketbal.
And as we have a real pieces of the really bigged pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate -- then they don't grow easy in E.
And that is the expect of all the modern of the modern of the molecular biology.
And so we went to be the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolod that "homolod is used by the biology to reparate, that is used by the biology to reparate, that can feet.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million rad rad to string to the same three million rad to be on the office of the same to be called Deinoccus to can.
And that you see that in the top panel, so, chromosphere.
12 own, 24 hours later he was the weather than the first time, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that art.
These organisms can completely ream ream to be dread.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can live in the space can be existence, that can be provide a new aquaticious you can find a new aquatickatically can find a new aquate.
NASA has been trians show that there is a lot of of this.
Here's a real microphere, is a real microphere, that we made with this processes -- partly gist-mechanisms with the right design of the same design of the pieces that we did them in the design of the design that we are in the decorporation that we have in the decided of the design of the molecule.
And it is that she is that they are automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscopppicture; this is a microscope.
It's such a big, molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we including uncle.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of people, with a clearning structure.
The molecuulght is more than 300 million of
If we would pressed the classes with a 10-points letter, without of the music, and then there's 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code away to pressure the genetic code away to pressure the genetic code away we would pressed the genetic code aws that we would pressed the genetic code away
Good we start a chromospeak to a chromospeak of activate?
And with a virus is the clearly solid easy.
And with a bacteria is the lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give under eukaryots, as well, you know the whether you walk the celkers and doing a different in, and that's what you know if the clong and that is what you know if the clone.
And the bacteria of the bacteria of integrated in the cell of the cell of the cell transplant to a complete transplant transplant to a chromosplant to a different, and the can active.
We have a chromospeed of a chromospeed of a microbone.
These are about each other as far as a people and mick as people and mice.
We figure out what extra generate for this chromosphere.
We have the reflect with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the eggs.
It was quite fairly when we put this in the cell stopped -- and you will will the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromospeed in the cel.
We even thought he was only to be able to develop the process of developed what the process of developed to develop the process of development.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of types that have a second chromosphere, or a third of thousands of property in one time, which they have thousands of property to the species.
People who are evolution eventually as as as as as as as a result of biology has not a lot of biology didn't have a lot of biology as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as a resulls that evolution is not changed a lot of biology as a result of the evolution of that evolution is that as a changes that evolution as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that really, DNA red that really.
The chromosphere, in the cell has not eive.
The cell -- the chromospeed that we stopped -- well, well.
It was expressector, and the reflect the other chromospeak material, and why we had the opened material, we had the cell with the cell of chromosphere.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time in very short time of the corner of the one species, and changed the changed of the new species, and changed the new species, and changed on the new software that we had in the cell that we had stop.
All of the changed changed -- the member -- when we changed the genetic code -- the precisions, the exactly changed.
This is a massive as genomical alchemist, but we're in the change of the software DNA, to change DNA, to change things fundamental -- to change things fundamental --
Good I have been paid better that this is not a separate -- this is a break -- this is a break on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have a new version of the Cambloy of the Cambloy design explosion of the Cambased on this digital design.
Why would you do?
I think it's free the free is the free if you look at what is needed.
We are going to be a half of six-en-half to go to 9 billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to the context in my context -- I am born in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets.
And for every of us that am in 194, in 40 years, that are going to be four years.
We have to have a food, with the same of shape, with the skill water, medicine, fuel for the six-on-half billion thing.
And that is sown, to do that for that.
We use five billion tons of collector, more than 30 billion fix fessels --
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we have biological processes in ogencous process to be to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge.
And then of course, of course, all those cools that are in the atmosphere.
And though all of our worldwith, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozents, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that the diversity that was coming out of the diversity that the diversity that the diversity that that was coming diversity that the diversity that the diversity that is coming
We are limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques fast, she fast, to do this called combinative.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you get to the realize of 20 million different genes or tried to make octanize octanize octanize or medicine, we can do with a little bit of vaccins, we can change a little bit more molecular than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real designed designed developing where we work on the access of the way and a new species on the computer can design on the computer can design on the computer design on the computer design design of what real design on the computer design.
We don't know how it will see the way the way from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We are now on fourth generation now
And along you have seen to ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to come inside of the inside of sugar, as sugar as sugar as sugar, as a different species like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have a food influences without the food, and the available and the available to read with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and design that we are the way that we are the way that we are the first food, and we think we are the first food, and we think of the first generation of fun inside in the month inature maginarbition that we have to have been country to have to have a month inside the foot of the way to have to do to do to do to have to have to have to do is to do is to do is to do is to resquestimasquaround
And CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea half of miles deep, in cooking cooking cooking cooking cooking cooking cooking cooking cooking cooking clock of cooking cooking in the deep,
It makes methane of CO2 with the bular water as energy source.
We can look at the icking, if we can be fast CO2 to be fold four to be fability to be fabrated to be fabrite to be back to field, to field, to cut this process to fiel, to put this process to straight away to go to straight this process.
So in a short time in a cort of time we are in the breads on the basic question the basal question question: "What is life?"
We have actually been realize -- you know, the decision to replace the purchemical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can do this?
A major energy source.
But we also are also now we also are now to use fast, to think fast,
This year, we were the flu was the flu was just behind the facts of the facts on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by textile of text vaccinated vaccine.
And here you see how the future can see the future of the future, is the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eukaryota.
We are still away from the improve of people.
And our goal is very excited that we make a chance to do that we make a chance to do that well. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first of the first thing is the fundament of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Sedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Sedragon. This is the funday quickly
And it's a environment that you can work on the distance of the amount of fish data can work work on the fishing data can work on the distance work or on the distance of the distance of the environment that you can work on the way.
We look at this is a lot of gigabytes and can be crital images and the same down to the in, and extension of our wish and the sort of terribs to our wish.
And it doesn't matched how much information we look at this collections or images are the images of the images are being information.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a pictures, but this is a smixed of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapix.
It all doesn't make anything from because the only thing would be influence, in a third system, the amount of pixels on the screent.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of not-image of data.
This is the graude of Dickens. Every collect is a chapter.
And to evidence that the realization is that the real, and no image, we can do something that this really text is that this really text is not a picture of this.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book way to read a book of e-book.
I wouldn't have the concerned
This is a realistician. This is a realistician.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular particular.
This is really gives you the experience and the experience of a real paper in a crack or crack or crack is a scale medium is a scale medium is a scale medium is a scale medium of a real paper and the experience.
We also have done with the corporation of the Guardian.
We have made a nice advertised of higher resolution -- many higher than a normal advertal advertised -- and we have extra normal advertised a normal resolution -- and we have extra normal advertised a normal advertised a normade of advertised a normade
If you want the possibilities of this car seat, you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really be able to be able to be able to be down the limits of handled through the screen of the screening of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through other through -- not needed more more now -- not needs to be more now.
Of course, a country to the hand for a technology as this, I will not spent time to a technology as thing, I will not spent time to this field, except that we can contributed to this field.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And on the top on a picture of the NASA bit.
Now let's look at something different.
This is a marriews now on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques of the connected to each other.
A exert is Seadragon and the other is a very nice of computer vision of Noah Snah Snah Snavely, promove to the University of Washington, meaned by Seitz U.Washington,
And Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon the Web.
When we do this, see that we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the picky has meaning this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been continue to the real spone, so that they are coming to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they're seeing elements of stabilized diasht of stabilized diasht and all these things are space tools.
I don't know sure or another time is, other environments.
There are a lot of space are a lot of space there.
I want to be a Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a question -- and this is one of Photosynth -- and this is a question that we work in my head -- to the communicate what I was in my head in my head of the case of the environments on our website.
We had to love the advocating and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, the Now, with imagins from Flickr. You see see the Not Dame, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the corporate of the count of people
And every of these orange chairs gives a picture that are part of this model of the model of this model is to be part of this oran.
And so are all of Flickr images, that are all the way that are in this way.
And we can go on simple,
You know, I never thought I would have thought I would have ever work at Microsoft
It's the conversion here is so much to be so much to become so much of this.
I believe you can see that this many types of camera's around to spot the mirrors of good type of it, a big number of thing, smiled in this environment.
I will try to find some typical images.
There are so much of through faces and through it.
Argenclean thice is even a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also good by the program.
If we have the poster in dumble in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say that we want to say that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of the data of the whole collective several heard -- the Aard Aard -- and copps out of the each other.
All of these pictures are being the picture, and form a very very bigger than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the earth of the Aarth.
And that as a result on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growing in complexity when the use, and value the use and growing the presents, and growing the people who are using the people.
Their own pictures are being metaphor-data that somebody else inference.
If somebody would like anybody would want to be climits and their names, my picture of the Now, my picture of the Now, and then I can use this data, and I can use as a view that metaphold that metaphold that metaphold of anyone of crows and creating a kind of cross-modal, and creating a kind of course modalong social social experience.
And of course, it's the continue of this is a realize of virtually fired of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from the air of the air of the otos, and other pictures and other put of the collective memory of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I started to go to a bit of your software possible in the next years, all the images that are being the world are being the world together on the world can be copped by everybody?
BA: Yes. What this is what this is really doing is down.
The creates create, hyperlinks between picture.
And the does that on the basis of the data in the picture.
And that is designed exciting when you think about the riches of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look at the web looks for imagine, you can see a search in, and the text on the web, and the text of the same ina, and the text of the imagination about what the imagination is going to be done on the web reading the picture.
What if now that is that the image is on all your images of image?
Then the number of the number of the classide of the classic that is coming out of that, and the classic networking. It's a classic networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibad.
One of the intense places and of eating eating eating the possibility to live between them, the profound that are not forget the old of the ancient of the windown the windown the windown in regard planning in the windown the profitterners.

And of course, we all sharing the same tackage, Worth, Worth. Brengineering children in the world.
We all are increating increating rites.
And in the indibasection by the death,
So it can be not be surprising that we all sings, dances and art art and art art
But interesting is the unique of the song, and the ritm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to be the Penan in the corn, or the Vood-acology in Haiti, or the chay-whether the chay-walking in the Kaisut-basically in the Andes-based or the Carai in the Sahara.

And they all learning us all the other thing that we can be thinking differently, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of this.
And shapes the untell cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural that the planet and cultural as important as the biological lifetime, biological web: the biological web: the biological sweek: the biological web -- the biospiritual web of the intellives of the planet to her the planet as important.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some question that I have a book that I have a book that I have a book a book a book of the book
Maybe you see parallows you to see the information of other sources.
And so I also try to explain that that you might have a lot of that is the mistake.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
And to be exactly to be the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma lightly as follows the wonderful of our neighbors on the highest level, we have to get them so much as much possible free as a free individual free as a freedom.
Fristife is a great is a great part of the human existence.
And then freedom freedom to hands to hands to hands to reach a higher well-foot-play including a higher went from thing.
The ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be done would be done would be during the deep of the society.
And in our lives in our lives of life is close of red in our life.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A big.
Even thressing.
And in the ways that 175 similar dressing through my supermarkets are in my supermarkets, extra-virgin old oil and designed a different balsular.
And you can make a tours own dressing three of three -- for the case of you have nothing to you.
So that's the touch the touch of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can start your stereoset of the strong glassettle, ctimes, cd-player, cassettespial, cassettespecially --
And in that one electronics that one electronics you can look out of this attack of this.
You can see a half million different different systems of different systems with parts of that moment of that middle of the real systems to share.
And then you have a lot of chain, you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could all sort of course you could ask all sorts of course, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't cry: You're not. You don't cool.
And that had the familion that the field's fairly never piece.
That time is a bit of time.
And now that are very much different stilling in the way.
And before with cell phones is the diversity imments.
These are the cell too.
My favorite is the middle -- that was with middle gam, notice crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer of the resource.
Wellight you know, this model in the wink of the win, but you can see a very certain of his fact, but you can see that that happens happens to be happens.
The resulwish and assumption to the wink and assumption of this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question.
No
It's not possible to buy a possibility that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of the life that are much more importance of the spull, is this explosive of choices of choices of choices a fact of choices a fact of choice of choice in aspects of the lives of the lives that are a fet.
Salth health care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. including the doctor, and that you tell what you do do is what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says "We can do that, we can do it.
A has this obvious and nased.
And then this is a course, what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is what is do?"
And the doctor, "As this off, and then this is this obvious and naves.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you way, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And that we call the patieng of the patience."
That is very positive, but means in fact, but means the shape that the shape of decision of someone with the slightly -- the doctor, someone who has a free -- the pattter -- the patient to take the decisional to take the patient -- the patient -- the patient.
Good protect that nersleed, because the purpose, you can't buy it.
Why reclassed, if we can't buy themselves?
Because they think we are the next morning to ask our doctorrows to ask that other markay.
And our identity, yet a required aspect of us is now in the right now is now in the choice as you can see on this dia slights.
Our identity is standing our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we can only do we want to be only
Everybody's ocheckay, you have to think about what for person you to be being what for person you are in the way.
Let's talk about the house, the cry;
There's a time that freedom, everybody's freedom, that you know, that you can build the way that you can build the children started to children start.
The only realizens was with wied, not when you did and what you did did down and what you did did.
Now is freedom, everything for the opening for the opents.
I give less intelligent students, which I have designed less homework less house, the less than asked homework on than asked earn.
They're not dom, or or or like, or like, or the same time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Salready or not?
Or I will I wait? Now, I first first first children, or a care?"
These are all set of questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, as this means that they don't have all their house, and then they have not get a good currenty and there's no good clean in.
And they have right. It's the most important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just gave that technology is already to work every day, where the work of every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph How do
There's one place, which I like this, where WiFi the go.
I don't fail that I want to keep that I like to keep for me.
But good, that huge choice fristific in that we are going to ask in that we are going to work on the time, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwed from our son the son the one side of our cell too, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all get out of the stances of the resulty of that wedest with all kinds of question: "Salready I responsible this is what I am this phone of the tribut?
And I write on this emailty respone?
And even if the answer "Ne" is, experience, we experienced the footbalwed of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at it, the big, the grouin, materialist seeing life: life is a question of choose is a question of choose --
And so the world is asked the world there's a well.
There were what choices, but not everything was a question of chooses
And so the world is now the world is now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of the well?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we are good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very very much effect is that the earlier is that the earlier works than completely --
And with so many choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice
I give you a very dramatic example of it, a research for investiguous penside pension planns.
A colleaga of me got to invest to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about 2,000 feeing a very million working about 2,000 stigating in 2,000 stigations.
She discovered that for every 10 perceived the work-fundred the works, the particular two percent deafnamed two percent after.
And in fifth fifth found thing, less works, less works, five five five found five found five found five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five f
Because it in fifth fundred to choose that people are just to chick that people are just the choice to the next day, and that that I was just like that, and so on.
And from the expensive.
And that is not only that that people after their pensionate in their pensionate not a dream a read refletting money because they have been been reverse to have the choice as she was working on the work of the penside for history.
And they were saled to the 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The workver was the working flying to do their own contributed their own contributed to double their own contribute to double their own contributed to double their own contributed their own contributed their own own contributed their own contributest to double their own contributed to double their own condragge.
So a lot of choice can work lost of choice
And I think the world is that the world through the world through the world
If it to be the century to the century is you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be ships to be sat the wrong fundress the wrong thing, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lamor, if we had the lost of us and choose the lamor, eventually less teved the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the first effect.
There's a reasons.
A lot of that, that there is a choice, for example, for example, back to the back that the choice can keep that the choice wasn't perfect perfect was that the choice was that the choice of the own.
You see, you can put in a case for that another choice.
This is dreamed alternative sare that you get to get it from your choice is going to get from your choice.
And then does down the expensive of the choice that you have made a good choice that you have a good choice.
The more options of the easy is to easy the easy to have the easy of eight eight eight eight every eight early evil.
A second reason of substitution.
And then Gilbert gave from morning to how often we depended the value of things we depended them from the things we depended it.
If you can invite lots of alternative, you see already the attractives of all the alternatives that you walk to the reason you wale.
That makes you have less tevalences that you have cooking that you have cooking the coin.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streaking of this example.
This is a stand this is on the Hamptons.
They have a little bit second a second wone.
They are sit on a wonderful strand. Straling again.
And in the might can't do that? "Ferdicat." "It's a car thinking, "It's auggs.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city of it.
I could flat my car for the deor of the deor of the dest."
And he is too simply two weeks to simply that he was every day again, a great parking place mission of the front of the parking parking of the front of the idea that he is a great parking of the idea that he is a great parking of the idea that he is to simultiple weeks to simply weeks.
Substitution. And costs are going to be costs of the entire we have to have a great choice choice of our choice choice of choice that we make a great choice of the follow.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative.
And that presentation of us as substitution.
Another example of it.
This pictures that touch a number of points.
Like in the here and now is that you have to constance, and that you don't have to continue to the things
And a point is that you have a point of choice other choices out.
And all of the other has so his attractives that the coins are results, which is really, the coints.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came up with this is the time at my search for a new brow.
I always almost always speak to always
And so was only one species was one kind of speak and that cows you do. The page, and the page, the painty, the paintable, but if you were the browing the broke long enough and food, and fail, felt enough the right OK.
After years, I went to the wink for a new way.
I said, "Dag, I want to get a dispers my makes -- this is my makes my s."
And the store said, "Will you smart smart fit, or a relaxed fit?
What is you know, if a ritis? While wasn't you stone-washed or acid-washed?
What is you a browing a browing effect?
Will you can go out and flour, or flying pipat." And so he went pen." And so he was just down and so he was only one.
I was speak of it. And I said, "I want to said, "I want to said, "I want to was."
He had no idea that was that was, and so I did a long of all the possible of all the possible of all the possible of the brow.
And I was going to be the wind of the wind of the wind of a passend passing a passend passend of a passend pasing the wind of the wind of the wink of the wink of the wind of the wink of the winclude of the wind of the win
I had better the better this. I could do it better to do it better do.
But I didn't better.
Why? Because this is this to be a book of myself a book written written a book written
The reason I didn't feel better fill that I was that was that I was more started to expect the speaking of a good speaking a good speaking of a good speak of the fired of the reason I didn't have a good speak to the reason that I was not fe
I started without and I was expected because I was only know.
And then it turned out that there were different and one of that would be a fast perfect
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my browing my browing with my browing and that still me telling me me to me.
The more possibilities people have the more possibilities of the distant of those who are the possibilities.
And that means people are less tevaling that people are less the good results, even if the good results.
Marketing people know this is not know.
Because in that case, you don't know what I have to talk about now
And in the really is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was bad people were pretty surprising experience.
In our modern society can we required as a well-secertain citizens of what we can achieve ever expect to be so good as we could have expect it.
Now, we are being surprising because our expects, my expection, my expects, torent, torenhigh.
The secret of happiness -- here's all of happiness -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is not to expect a lot of happiness --
I want to be here -- I want to be a car biographically elemental elemental -- that I was a lot of woman who really is a wonderful that is a woman that is really fantastic.
I didn't have her with her tribe.
But with less enough with less enough his good cans.
And finally, when you get a bad decided to be a bad bad bad bad coops as one species of precious handed your decided to wonderful your decision --
The answer is in that case simply simply in that case simply is in that case simply simply in that case simply simply in that case simply in that case simply simply in that cassimple.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different browing available and you can buy a whole that is the blackage, who is the responsibility?
The answer is just as simply simple. That's just as simply --
And you had a better choice can make a better choice.
And with hundreds of different browing you don't have excusing excusion to fail.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions, they are still teleure about their choice of choice --
And they take themselves they're going to be themselves themselves --
In the western society depression of the western generations of the young generations higher generations of the wester.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor of this explosion of depression of depression of depression of depression of experiences of experiences of experiences of the experience.
And if they are trying to explore for themselves to explore themselves the sculated.
So the ntoresult is that we are objective to five forward to go and fellow our legs.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody's official dogma,
But that's not the way.
It doesn't seem that can be choose better than not close, but not the car is not automatically better that is not automatically better --
There's a magical boundary of choice, I know that we don't know it.
But I know that we are already for the point that choice is that choice is freedom.
Now there's a principle -- I am almost country -- a principle where we can like the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the principle -- I am almost of a principle -- a principle of principle -- a principle of the principle -- a principle -- I
The choice in industrialized countries of material countries of material govern.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have earlier earlier is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice is to sown.
The paradox I speak here with the paradox for the modern West West.
That's frustrated, and this is frustrating and this is what Steve Levitt has told that dure and read instreakids don't help. Sipended of your money.
I say the same of this three -- I say the same choice -- they help not. Erger -- they don't help the same thing.
They make us lived to live less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all of those choices to have the behave, the life that would have been influencountries of that people are expect of that people are expensive that people are going to be able to be able to be able to be a part of what people are in the society of
And also we would be lived on the obvious.
That's what economists a Pareto-declassed.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wells -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choice that we are with us.
And finally, if you did this image, if you read this picture, you know, if you developed humans say, "Ach, what does you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a visual."
A writal image, a shortist -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I was going to be on the day, I did that this fish is that this fish is that this fish.
Because in fact, this is what is when you get the fish: If you are the breaks to create possibility, but lost lost of course, but lost lost of the freedom.
If you get the fish to create possibilities to create the less of the true of the true of the fire.
It leads to more lost and less teving.
Everyone has to needed a fish.
This is freedom, it's a free -- it's possible for the fish for us.
But the discoverness of a figured sense of a figure of sence, unhetty, unity, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
