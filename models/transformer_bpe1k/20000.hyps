And I show you that the two dia's two dia's lician to show that the police of the last three million years of the size of the vastance of the U.S. . S, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the resemble of this specific problem because it didn't show.
The ice cape on the North Pole is in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and cryms in the summer.
The next slide of what is a dicattempt of what happened the last 25 years is happened 25 years of what happened 25 years of what happened
The permanen-fields in red.
As you see it from the dark bluew.
That's the yearly, in the year, the winter.
And it cryms in summer.
And the same permanens or five years or older is almost like blood, is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body.
In 25 years is the way from this to this before.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern IJszea sea and there is a very big high warms of frozen carbon death, when it is frozes in methane, when it is increated by microbecomes in methane.
And realized to the total high-low exciting in the atmosphere, that could be double the amount of the atmosphere.
In some of the single of the same including of the water.
And Afried Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another understand another une-in-indiep me.
What is OK. The question is real or we will be be.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warming warming warming.
This is a smell aterriver of this is a melebrater river.

On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And Afried month scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice now a negative ice balance.
More specifics is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly quickly quickly so, with nones a few of the single of the same of the South Pole is a few of the South Pole,
The whole continent is the whole continent sea of six of the same thing like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice mases, there are now new now, there were new now a few years ago,

In the Andes, is this gler the source of drink water for this city.
There are now more stromes.
But when they disappeared, also the drink water.
In California was a fix of 40 percent in the snow in the snow pack of the Sierra.

And as you could read the predictions of the predictions of it.
This worldwide dream has led to a dramatic styction of the forest of boses.
And the number of natural around the world is still and never seeing a incredible and never seeing seen speed.
Four more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the last 75 years.
This pattern is completely undress of this pattern is completely undress is completely undress is completely incredible unless is completely.
If you look at the piece of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 million ton of CO2 hours --
25 miles tons of the every day in our oceans, Kean area of the Stille area of the Stille Ocean, from America, west, and every single soxies, and every single drastic dragin, there is a drastic dragle of the oceans.
The only great caused of the Earth, next to the Earth, next to 20 percent money, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and sted of the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding of China.
And there was a lot of more urban iness of more urban central of more urbing center.
But we see a communic.
These are the steps carbon the break of the building was annuled in the last years, and where large alternatives were propossible alternatives were proposed to the benefits were blow.
There's a political stated on the country.

And that picture to me.
And the chargest of the curry in Tennesse, about four billion liter billion liter modder of modder belie.
You probably have seen the news face.
This is the one after the largest of the biggest difficult in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hopefully about how that machine.
So here's I ad. Vor those who were not the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever subject in 27 miles in the side.
It has to be the circumstances that were resources that were less than a billion times a billion times a billion times a second of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Big Bangs inside detectors and this is what I work. It is a bread, 22 meters -- 44 meters -- 44 meters in diameters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in connection.
And on the 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That was a party care in the controlling of the controllect room.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the LHC around the LHC and with sature of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC,
In other words, when we were picture that picture on 10 September knew that the machine work, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of the biggest and saw that was went to Google and saw the Internet page.
And that means we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which was to make a problem with these gold.
And they were drags 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers are going to be saying, "Not true. It's too small of your dram."
They can do that because they can be superated on all the low-temperature temperature of the low.
So on min 271 degrees of the good stars, the myself between the stars, that can be drager between between the global of the global between the stars,
In one of the connection between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a construction.
And that was a wirelectric again, and there was incredible electric against 13 thousand amper resources.
This was the result.
This is another inpressive if you realize your realize that magnets more than 20 tons of weavain, and they were about 30 centimeters were inch.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of them, what we did do.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather.
We will be expected to be expect to expect it in June or yourself in juniverse, so we can go with the except what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, who have incredibate about the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research research. It's easy to work
I think it's so hard that it's so difficult, it's so hard to be further than ever beyond the LHC.
I learned the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, dissed, I did the devices of the value experiments of his learning of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so much more than ance, "Now, something is so much more than to take our images than our images of science, and we are not ever definitely of the world that we are near completely -- and they are not -- and we did that we didn't have been defadefinitelected to be not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be not read definitimasussizzzzzes of the read of the athrough the athrough our o
Thank you very much!
I would like to start to ask you back to your kids to your kiddle to your childhood when you play with block of block.
And then you discovered how to go to the border, they opped up and conscious problems to solve the problems with the desive with and depended by the skult of space relationships.
Rumultiply is strong because with the world to understand of the world to understand
If an information inspired by the native of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advision -- samper Jeee and my medicer Jeee Kalanithi -- what if we were used to ask a computer -- what if we used a computer of that entire mouth of information that is a lot of information that we could use event a plate of information that we can undered a lot of information that we can see information with a lot of information that you can see a lot of informulate and evitive e-fland we can see what information that information of information with the bs of information with offics of information that is mous of phy-fulation of information of information of information that is ft of information that
and can we orders like to leave it?
This question here, we decided that we decided to search a response to search a through the Siftables.
Stort of a single of a Sift a interactive computer in the size of a quookies in the size of a quooks.
They can be able to put up with the hand they can be able to feel each other, and they can detect a screen and shape contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handelblocks that they can be place by understand through it may be fixed by understand
Bovenues are Sift a single of an instance, for the way, for the ways,
And so this resources are a more physical different of the physical different of their motion and even of the way we are movement and even of the way we are movement, there are different new and fun new new and leak of the way we are explore.
I will start with some simple example.
This Sift is instift to show a video that are playing to show up a video of cancountry, and otherness and otherness of office and others play and other.
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious consciousness.
Indicated to each other, they will be interesting.
If they are being them to be realized this and can be some powerful waiting this.
She feel she feels and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of a color was baring of a color was a listening of a color was a listening of a listenist.
In this example three Sift of the case Sift of the remarkable to use them to small in a leg, where they are become together.
If we have dreview of the return.
There are some clear clear cappe of education, form play play of the education, mathematics and logics that we want to give things quickly quickly to try to try to try to see things quickly understand the result of seeing things.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmmatic programmatic programmmatic programmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmmatic of a Fibonacci of a F
Here we show you a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every raround a raround leaster letter around every Sift of every Sift of the dictionary words.
And after about 30 seconds it is really results of becomes a new series of series of series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am it to try to make it out of a video of it.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this pollution is that people nearly nearly nearly nearly instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know exactly what they do is do.
Here are some other people on the other people on the test.
That's our young booms of the type of the right.
It seems that he just just the Sift the Sift of stack.
For him was just blocks.
Here is an interactive paintingly painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift with that character of the table.
He shows the sun coming up the sun rise.
Video: The Sun comes up the Sun comes up.
David Merrill: No he has a tracor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done this! Yeah! Yeah!
And by shake the shape of Sift to each other, he can respond to the characters of the characters -- Video: Wlllet me respond to each other.
DM: and so his own story of the story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a open each eive.
and he decision how it decip.
Video: The cates flies away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesize of music and live music instrument that we have recently recently a sound product like the lead, as the lead, bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and drum.
Eenyer has been four different variations that you can choose seeing what you want to use it.
And these sound in ready Sift so that you can be injected in the pattern so that you can detern the pattern of the pattern of the pattern.
You put up a sound of a sound of the pattern of a leg Sift of a leg Sift of a controllabel, as reverbal efits and filter.
They are become in, and sound a sounded and souple of cance.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern of the pattern
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Sift in two Sift to a first pattern lost pattern by a extra lead.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feel a little slagh.
Video: And now I can buy the filter to the filter to the filter the effect of the effect live influence.
Video: I can accelerated it by the cancount of the side of the tempo block of the tempo block of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the block of the simo of the simo of the simo of the office.
Video: DM: Now I pell the movie to the base for what more expressy.
Video: I can re-shape it pattern here.
So I don't have to planning everything to plann, but I can improvise the longer and borter like I want.
And with the end, the dimms of the end, by the entire Sift to square.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from the new people, my passion of new people, which is better interfaces that our brain and bodies our brain and bodies work.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of early possibilities that we are developing on the developing of the developing of the developing of the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the same thing is that this is just a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to do with you and you can all and you go to you all and I look at it.
I'm writing write.
Books write is my work, but also many more than that.
My whole life long for a long time, and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there is unless of a bit of a bit of my life, and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work again.
And it started with a book, I have a book, I have a memoire, "Ets, Biddle -- "Eten, Biinning that was very early in my earlier work and an international stance.
And the result is that people are now everywherever I mean, as if I was doing in the way.
World where -- you know, does --
People come to me and ask me and ask me to me, "Ben you don't know that you can never ever ever deal?
Don't you know that your whole your whole is going to write your whole is going to be more book, but never a book that people will be heat?
You don't have a bang of that?"
Sustoment, you know, you know.
Now, I was a teenage that would be a 20 years ago, I was back 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- if I was write told I write was writing that I wanted to be a teenad.
People said, "You don't know that you never get success?
Don't you go to again, that you will resembit?
Don't you ang your life to this work is that you will be able to be able to be something from being something from the broken and you will be able to dreams on the puin your broken bits of broken with your broken broken on the broken of falen?"
Something in that stread.
And in the short comes on this question: "Ja."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are being called stuff.
All of the time.
But I'm also many other things that you don't know a lot of other things that all of it.
For sea seeing stuff, and other one of things.
But what is write I write the last time that comes from, where that is coming feet.
Is it rational?
Is it logically logically that somebody is being the work for the work for the work for the work for the work for their human on Earth of the Earth?
What is so break about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mindness, something about different work on the way that doesn't happen to be able to be able to be able to do the effectly thing about the effects of the mind of the minutes of the mind of the minds, and
Now, you know, my father. He was skulling engineer, and I can't remember that there was a bit of the 40 years that he didn't have any bang or he didn't have any to be bang for it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, so didn't be about being it.
And to be fair being a fair of engineers have been through the centuries, also not the reputation of manicical depressive alcolists.
Scheters wonder, that have this kind of reputation.
Not only just writers, also other creative people have reputation to be instability, instability.
Look at the grimmiles of the grimmix of the most magnifical creative mind the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own does.
And even those of those who don't even have a self-moorn under to be amazing their gave gave in.
In the last interview for his death said, "Mailer: "My of my books is a piece of myself a piece of myself away."
That's very very very prety to say about your life work.
But of this kind of except that we don't look at it.
We all heard all before and have heard and have it with succeed.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is involvity to expect the lish and that a artist, and that is going to read to ellent.
And I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea life?
Did you know, OK?
Because I'm going to think about thought about the close of the course, I don't think about it.
I think it reference it again.
And also another dangerous.
I didn't like to see this century this century.
We can creative mind a lot of better to live sport live.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, for a dangerous to live to the dark of dark to these dark before.
Seally the fase that my career in which my career now in my career now
Let me just say, I'm still young, amper fired of years.
I can make maybe four decades work.
Heastlikely everything I'll be another published by the outside world as the world as the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up here with friends, so I can slow you in the highest success: highest successarily behind me.
Jig, what a idea!
If you think about it, you're going to be able to do it again, you know, the morning to the drive hours on the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work of love.
The question is: "Hoe?"
And after long after long after the conclusion that I can just go through a psychological scribed in the process.
I have to write a securring between myself between myself and my overences between myself and my overcome to the reactions on my futures on my futures
I went to ways last year to ways that this.
I have been doing in history and have been down and have found in other civilizations or others have found a better way to see creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with emotional complicative process.
My search has been browed to the old Greeks and Romein.
Leak, because it's a long and intraveled story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins divided not creativity was a hund-in-hunt of itself.
And I believed that creativity was a good particular spirit was a godding, inknowledge to the human reason and unknowledge and unknow.
The Greeks now, the Greeks of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon who had a dislept him that influistered it.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they were called them a called creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their policy was a geniused in a genius, who are operated in the walls of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house,
If the artists was working for the genius,
And the way he shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the earlier that I had the earlier about the results of the results of your work.
Everybody knew that is how that in his work in his work in his work
The artists was so in protection to protect a lot of narcism.
If you were not brilliant there.
Everybody knew that you had a invisible genius,
You know, you know, the result of the result that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty input of an inhandiction.
Lig time is that the way in Wests creativity was creativity to the Wests creativity was considered to the Wests
And then the Renaissance, and everything that changed.
There is a very new idea of the individual human is the individual human point of the universe and mysterious of the universe and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godddominated of the godddominated
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity was completely from the individual --
And for the first time in history was about artists artists that they had a geniused to be a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big faid.
And to one person, one person, one person, one person believe that he or she or she she or she she or the cral is the essenti, the essentially mystery, of everything is -- and it's a known for a fragile of everything -- that is something to a fragion a fragult for a frager human psyche.
Anybody asks you can close the sun in sun smart in smarkay.
Egos are blows to gigantic proportunitial proportunately expectations of prestations of prestations of prestations
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists of artists had made a lot of artists of the last 500 years of artists --
If that's so so is, and I think, "What is the question: "What now do you now?"
Can we do?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship of the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years of rational humanism not make increated in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the 18 minutes
Probably are in the audience of the audience of scientific drivers have been about the idea that equal resources of the idea of the equal creatures of artists to inspiration to inspiration high ods.
It doesn't seem to get you all of you.
And yet I ask it down.
Why not?
Why didn't we have that thought that thought to next to next to be next to be next to be next that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought didn't we need that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that th
It just just just as much as much as all of the other explanations of the total inculators of the total inculators that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has been trying to create something -- so in fact, so -- so in fact, so in fact, we don't always -- knows that the creative process, not always rational process --
That sometimes nearly almost paranormal.
I have unless the great American direcal American direcal Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the great American diStone of the great American diglobal American diglobal American diStonly direction.
She is did a did of the negenties. Her whole write them.
She told me about her jeught on the platattrance of Virginia.
Sometime, if she was working on the work of work she was a poemmber she was a poemmber country.
It was so said so, as if there was a big wave air,
Seither wave golf than the country to her the country to her the country to her
She felt that the ground, under her feet, and it was that her to shape and that her on that time to do that the time to be a single thing for her life.
She was rising hinvolved by the poem and she had to see so quickly and paper and paper and paper and paper and showing up and showing and paper and showed to the home.
When the poems through her her was waves her only shape chances to write it on the sky.
Sometimes she didn't have enough.
And then ring and ring so, but reached the house.
And in summmoments the moments of her being her -- in the field, on the field, in her words -- in her words -- to another direction.
And I think there were a mistake -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost mistak the nearly mistaking.
And then she was looking for home and paper and paper it was close to heavail.
Juist on that moment she had a pot-set of piece.
And with her other hand, so told me she was poems the poember from the air.
She picked up with his starian again, and it back back in her body, while it back in her body,
In that cases came out of the close of paper in supply paper -- but then in the area fully follow.
When I heard that I thought -- what I thought -- what happens to be my creative process.
And so my creative process! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse of mouse who every day on the same time, and sweet and sweet and sweet and sweating through the sweet and trans through a is a shape.
But even in that day swood, I have a quarter, I have been experience.
You can also know it will be a sense of that creative ideas in your blow. There are creative ideas in your broidentificated from a source that you can identified.
What is that that for sources?
How can we use it without that without we become a become a through we become a become a thout of the time.
And one way that good for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a perhaps a magazine.
We had the way to be about this.
And to be a big part of his life of his life had been a big, the showed of the amazing artists that was trying to get all the power of the power to get industry to the unfortable creative impults that in him.
Well, the 1990s was a little bit of smoom.
And one day he read in Los Angeles about the speed in Los Angeles, and changed it in radical.
And while he was so real, he heard a fragmental of a melodi.
The decided is that inspiration that is failed to understand -- understand --
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to be the fasth.
But it didn't do that.
He had no paper type, no taperecorder to its a tape of paper in itch.
The wonderful exampiation is after weather again, "I recoming the melody reflect me every single every single every single early
I'm not good enough enough, I can't do it.
He didn't real real real process, but he stopped that whole mental process.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see the slight I behind the sture?"
"Do you really know that I can write a song of song
If you really want this song is there, you have to be again, you have to do another time when I am for you.
Now, you know, somebody else -- somebody else.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from that point the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonar." And from that point is the way to Leonard Cohen
The work itself is a same thing, with the dark of dark subject.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him disappeared the engineering of genius,
It was a smim on the skin and listed and just just made it close to the skin and list.
And to realized that there was no reason to go through to go through through this.
It also could be a wonderful like, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diase of Tom and the own of Tom myself wass.
That story has changed.
I have ever been a profound.
I was writing in the writer of Etts, Biddle --
And I think about a moment in the moment in wonder.
You know that well, you don't want to work good and you think it is a terrible ramp of a disastrike. It is bad book.
Not somer one, really bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad b
I wanted to do it all the project all the project all of the project all the project to do it all the project all the project of it.
And then I remembered Tom that the enius, and I decided to be a power to way.
I wish from my manuscricians and I founded to me a leger of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know everything, we know everything, we know everything, that is not just by me.
You can see I do everything in the stop I have in the stop of what I have in me.
More can't give you a little bit of it.
If you find that it is better can, you have to do your thing better.
Snap you don't know that you, y? Don't you that, right?
I just write down because that's now my work.
O, and in the notuls are policy-a-today is just a simply on office are a differen."
Tja--- United it comes on the nase.
Enything ago, there were in the North African desert people to dance in the North African destine music.
And then the morning legs, to the morning glors.
That was great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometimes, very single, some of a real thought of something --
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you also know what I mean, you also have you also have one of the time that you have been so much as a performer.
It was like the time still still and the dance of the stappear by a porder stap.
He didn't disn't otherwise anything else, but now everything together.
Suddenly he didn't read a longer only a human being.
In him, under him, under him glunder it.
A good fired down through fire.
And if one of the thing happened to be a little bit of Dan they started class and in close and in cording to call, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By way, a leuk historical fact that say: Toen the Moren Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanist of the same thing with with this.
The quote is again, the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla, other."
That is the day of your day at the day of stiped and flumengodances.
If an artists in Spanist something impossible or magic, "Allah, other, other, other, Allah, other, brea."
One of the God. Se: a glimp of God.
Preciipment what we need it.
Lastil is real the dance of the tances at the next morning to the dince of the dincluded of the edinarly didn't low.
And that moment is it again, he is a little bit of parents that maybe never more that maybe never more than the same high of solic hight?
Maybe there will never be anybody God assummmits of during its are dance.
What has to be another one?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to squares for a creative mind for a creative mind.
But so painful doesn't have to be able to be not to be it.
Now, imagine not from the most unusual aspects of your person aspects of yourself coming from yourself.
Imagine you believe them a whiled to a whiled of a didn't navage of a didn't navail.
When you ready ready do, they are ready to somebody else.
And so it property anything to do it.
I depended up in the middle of thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book, that is going to be different showed to a book, and book, and book, and book,
The opinier of that illuster progress.
If my mind with me the hall, I hold me to the same for, I still the same thing -- not bane. See doesn't bane.
And so you just put your work.
You just do you do this, what it is.
If the your task is to dance, you know, thank you.
If the good engineering that you is decision to decide in your work on enious of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source
Now, it doesn't happy through through it down through it.
And also, "Ole on!"
I believe that believe that I believe that you can do this.
"Ole any!" how than ever we pure from pure human love and own wisdom by the ways.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole on!
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovered of new seases.
We actually started from a new point: we were the digital codes to the digitalized to the digital codes and now to try to go to a new fase of digital codesigns and synthetives and synthetives of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living -- is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand on different levels on different level.
We have different approached different approached the back to minimute, it back to minimutes
We're now now 20 years to the digitalized in the digitalization.
And when we have sequenced, it was the way from the analog world of the analog world of the biology world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask life regenerate, or can we make new life create, or can we create new life of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a laboratory-oratory-ory-ory-oryma genome of a laboratory-genome of a kind of a small.
And we can get to look at if we can get to a nice or we can get a none.
We can take in the order of hundred generated the 500 or so there's a 500 or so there's a 500 or so there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively relatively with the one.
Maybe aw. This is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can excition is the very unliving cell that this would be a living cell of cell read cell that this would living cell a living cell of cell that we can look at the genes of the genes that this would be a living cell of the genes that we can look at the genes that this is a living cell
We decided to be able to ask this chromosphere, to synthetic so that we could decise the components so we could decise the components to be so the components to ask the components to ask this chromospire questions.
And so we started asking with question: "Can we started a chromosphere?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry of the very great molecules that we never have see?
And, if we can do that, a chromosphere, "Any?
A chromosphere, but a piece is a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelerating exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic coded lose real longlasshape but is a lot of slowly slowly long,
And our last point would be the point on this moment curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical tsophistication for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are 10 of machines in the world that little DNA makes DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it be.
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigators of all the phics.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X174.
That's a little virus fruss that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the bicks,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part of the time, when we put a piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria of genetic coded and vironments make virons.
The viral particles were flosed from the cells, they were came back and then the E. coli.
I was unless the oil, and I said that they were oil to the oil industry, but I said that she was a bit of good snaps.
They laughts over you.
And we think this is a situation in which is a situation where the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassetts, so we could figure the size of viruss, so we could figure the cassettts.
to understand what the real components of a living cell components of a living cell of a living cell
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that is very accurame,
And when we first first of this genome was the standard in 195 was the standard of the standard of 10,000 basepares.
And finally we found after 30 follow. If we had the original sequence had used to start the original sequence was not to start on the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design of the designs that are long long over the other pieces of 50 letters to build so a 50 letters to build so that they can designed so that they can designed so that they can design so that they can designed so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design as a long of the other pieces of
We designed in this unique parts of the unique of this.
Maybe you have read water remarkable to put water in stop.
And I think about this: we have a four-genetic genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters codes for back 20 aminozurs -- that there is a only letters -- that there is a only letters of every aminozure for each aminozure of the letters of the clear atters of each others of the letters of the letters of the letters of the letters of the letters of letters of let
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
At a sign, we just came to the me.
Some of them were not poems that there were no poems were no poems were not poemb.
We have these pieces of designed that we can eath them with enzymes.
There are enzyms that they repay and in each other.
And we started pieces of making pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long long and you have put pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, until of 2,000 letter, to 72,0000000.
And in every stages we were flying a flot of these pieces of pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that's going to strake.
We try to reach the point of automatization
So this is a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketbal.
And as we are really bigge pieces -- more than 10,000 baseparats -- then they don't grow easy more than 100,000 baseparated more in E.
And that is the expensive of all the modern of modern molecular biology.
And we went to say with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists "homologist, that is used by the biology to reparate, that pieces of the biology to repairs of the biology to foot.
Here is one example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiod-million radiod-billion rad square.
And that you see that in the top of the top of the top of chromosphere, just from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it in each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that around this.
These organisms can completely picture.
They can live in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can exist, that can be promovement, a new aquatician environment.
NASA has been marries show you that there is a lot of of this, there.
Here is a design micropphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- actually just gist-mechanisms with the right design, but we did them in the right design.
It is care that they automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a microscope picture.
It's such a big moleculecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
This is pictures, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publish we expansive inside of the publish.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest moleculed by people, with a people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-million is more than 300 million of three million.
If we would deplot of the 10-points letter, without speas, there is 142 pages only to present the genetic code away.
Now, how do we started a chromosphere? How do we activat?
And with a virus is the clearly eas a prety easy.
Well, with a bacteria is the much inared.
It's also simple, if you put under eukaryots, like we just wis: your whether the cell of the cell of it and that's what you know if it's all know.
And the bacteria of the bacteria is the chromosphere, but we have a represented in the cell transplant transplants of a chromosplant transplantation of a chromosplentation of a chromospling to a other, and it can active.
We have a chromosphered of a micromospited of a microbbenefits of a micromosphere.
These are about again, as far of each as people and mously muso.
We were foogs to have a genes to be so that we could select to be a chromosphere.
We have the fred with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell stopped -- and you will be the very avanced graphic imagine -- the new chromosphere, the new chromosphere,
We even thought he would even thought it would just come to show it further out of developed to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of chromosphere, a second chromosphere, or a third of thousands of own thousands of own thousands of own in one times of the species.
People who evolution evolution as if there are one of the equires didn't change a lot of biology community.
There are enzyms that are restriction ense enzyms that actually DNA resources.
The chromosphere, in the cell has not equalive.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stopped -- well, well.
It was expression, and it was refully the other chromosphere, and it was a strange material, and why we had the cell of the cell with the new chromospher.
He was blue blue from the genes that we had stopped in it.
And very short time we disappeared all the characteristics of the one of the kind of completely in the new species, and it is the new software that we stopped in the cell of the new software that we stop.
All the egger is changed the genetic coded -- when we set the genetic coded was the genetic coded was the precisions.
This may sound as a genomical alchemist, but we are in state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things, to change things.
And I have been doing before before this is not a skull -- this is not a skull of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have been put that maybe we made a new version of the Cambal explosion of the Cambrain, based on this digital scale, based on this digital design.
Why would you do?
And I think it's pretty if you look at what you needs to look at what there.
We go insix-half of six--half to 9-half to 9billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for every of us that in 1946; in 194, that will be four become four being are four bear.
We have a lot of food, with food, with the single of water, medicine, fuel, fuel, fired for the six-half billion.
And that's showed to do that for next to do that for do.
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we have biological processes in ogenschoul, or anything to replace that to replace that is a huge challenge challenge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to replace that to replace that to replace that is to replace that is to replace that to replace that to replace that to replace that if we have a huge challenge challenge of a decisi;
And then of course there is all those carbon dioxide of the stor that in the atmosphere.
And though our worldwish of our worldwith, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had onics but a dozero -- and look at the diversity that has been coming out of the diversity that comes from there.
We are consider concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now now is a quick quickly synthesize of the combinations to do so called "combinations of doing the combinations of do.
We now have the possibility to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes or protect processes or trying to make octance or designing octans or drug vaccins, new vaccines, we can change a little team of vaccines, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life fibility, chemical or fire, vaccines and so forth.
This is a screen of what real designs that we work on the software that we work on the access of the way and a new species, and a new species.
We don't know how it will see it from the way from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We now focus on fourth generation on fourth generation of fuels.
You have seen you in the bad to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have two-second fuels that are coming inside of the burning comes from coming from sugar, to more hig, to more hig, or different fuels like octypes or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology big influence without the food, and the food-a-a-a-available prize is if we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and we think of the way that we are capable to design, and we think that the first fourth of the first fourth of the first generation that is fired to have the first fours infired of the 18 months of the foods.
Something light and CO2 is one method -- but our global discoveries, we have all sorts of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods and CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method of the worldwith.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 piles of a half piled of the deep, in coalts.
It makes methane of CO2 of molecular water as energy like energy source.
We can take a way or we can take CO2 -- what easy is easy fail via of fabried to factories, where that CO2 is returned to five this process.
So in a short time, we think we are in a short of basically we are in the basic question: "What is life?"
We have a real, you know, -- you know, the purpose to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do this?
A major a important energy source of becoming
But we also now are also use of these works, to think about quickly,
This year was the flu was just a bit behind the facts of the facts on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that change from teforward to make a vaccines.
Here you see how the future of the future of evolution is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolution to evolution with synth.
We are more removed of the improvement.
Our goal is certainly to sure a chance to survive a chance to survive long enough to do that may to do that.
What I want to show you as quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we were to a new technology that we were to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragons. This is Sedragond. This is Sedragone.
And it's a environment in which you can get local or on the immense amounts of visual data can work data.
We look at a lot of many gigabytes of digital images and can remains on insive in, and extended to our wish, and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms of engths.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at these collections or images or images or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a pictures, but this is a scan of the Library or Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel.
It all doesn't make anything of the only thing that would be influences of the extensions, on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-picture of data.
This is a graum by Dickens. Every colold of Dickens. Every colold piece.
And to prove that it is really trust, and not a imagination, we can do something that this really text is a little bit of the isn't imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book.
I wouldn't invitions.
This is a realistician, this is an example. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a part of a particular part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or amagazine, which is actually actually a scale medium.
We also have something done something that with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a napplicated from high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra information information information information
If you want to see the possibilities of these car seats you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make the limits of the way we can do the limits of the screen of handels of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other blows and other thing.
Of course are land-maps for the hand for a technology like this, I will spent a technology like this, I will not spent time to this field that we can spent a lot of this field of a lot of this,
This is all the weaks in the U.S.
And the top of the top of the NASA .
Let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web.
This is a project of Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Snahin-promotion, promotion, promotion, depended by Seitz Seitz U.Washington, beautiful Washington, and the other is a very beautiful of Washington and the other is of Washington the University of Washington of Washington the University of Washington the University of Wask of Wash.
and Rick Smself-soft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragond.
And when we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have been pictures of these images to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canaded diasht of stabilized diashy-pically diashybe pically imaged these things are space beyes.
I don't know sure or another time is, other time is the other time is the other time --
There are many of space are much more space.
I want to be a Noah's original data setony of data settones -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth that we were working -- to the communicated, the way I have to be communicated in my heads of this technique, to the real force of this environments on our website.
We had to have to be able to be the advocated and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames from Flickr. You search in Flickr. You just get in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and get images of the No.
And every of these orange is the image of this orange that are part of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this orange of model of this model of model is being every much of this orange of the orange of this orange of model of this orange of this orange of the model of this model of this model of
And so this is all of Flickr images, which are in this way in this way.
And we can capable to be on simple wish navigate.
You know, I never thought I had ever thought I ever thought I ever thought to Microsoft.
It's overwhelever happened to be so much of this.
I believe you can see this many types are camera's are: everything from gs: everything about mirrors of thing, a big number of this,
I will try to find some some strange images.
There are so many concluding and this.
Something about this, even thought is even a series of pictures -- here's a series of pictures --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dadid is also cheap-also cheap-by the program.
If we put through the poster in this, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do with social environment. This uses the data is that the data of everybody -- of the whole of the whole of home of home -- and the Earth -- and buy the Earth -- and buy of the other.
All of these pictures are being each other, and a very larger than the same than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth
And this as a connect on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when it use the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being metaphor-data that somebody else of the photographs of metaph.
If somebody would like to pick all of these heilled and their names, and then their names, and then my picture Dases with all of the Now, and that can use that data, and I can use this thing, and that can use metaph, used to use this metaph, used to be used to be used to be a point of course of clocal experience of the capable of close either than anybody of course of all of these close moditial social experience.
And of course, it's the type product a immentary fashion of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from air, who don't just from air, which is not just from airs, and other pictures and other passocial and other passociated of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what your software possible in the next years, on a day, in the next years, all of the world that are defired by everybody can buy on the world together on the world can buy together?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovery.
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it doesn't does on the basis of the image.
And that is designing when you think about the riches of the richdom of semantic information whatever mantic information whole mantic information in which is a lot of these images.
When you look at the web looks for images, you see a quarter, and the text of the web page, and the text page, many information about what the image result of what the image result of the image result of the image of the picture.
What if now that is picture to all your pipvilege,

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some questionly, I included a book.
Maybe you see paralls with information of information from other sources.
And so I also try to explain which you have mistak that you may be mistaking for you.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows like this: Om the skills on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to get them so many of individual free of the individual free.
Freedom is a great is a great deal, a essential part of the human existence.
Bovents still freedom to us in the power to reach a higher wonder, to reach a higher amazing without of thing.
The ultimate freedom in choices we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more profound.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would be done in the society.
And also in our life is this dogma citelebrated close.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice of choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even thress thressing.

Sealth health -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. -- and that you don't go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you need to do.
Now, you go to the doctor, and that says "We can do that, we can do that.
As has this obvious and nadelivers.
There has this obvious and after?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is do?"
And the doctor, "As has this oblighter and -- and I think this oblid and nase.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call of the patients of the patient."
That is very positive but in fact, in fact, but in fact, in fact, the shape of decision of the shapes -- the doctors of the slighter -- to a leak -- the doctors of a realize of a resull of course, and not the best condition to take decisions.
Good is considered that ners, because the purpossibly group, you can't buy buy it.
Why is recently, if we can't buy they're buying to buy they?
Because they think we are the next morning to ask our doctors to ask that other notice to ask that other notice.
Our identity, yet a single aspect of us existing is now overwho's every single away you can see on this dia slight of this.

We find ourselves from -- so often we just want to do it.
Everybody in the opposition to the opposition you want to be thinking what you want.
Let's talk about the house, it comes in the sky.
There is a time that freedom that freedom of the way that you were so quickly from that you were so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quick
The only real choice was wrong with wish, not when and what you did did did
Now freedoms everything for the opportunity.
I give you a lesson intelligent students that I developed 20, I had a design percent less housework on than asked in the same way
They don't be domber or like, or like,
No, they have the pressure with choices --
"Sall I married not? Stary now?
Or I will wait wait? Now, I first children, or a caree?"
This is all set of questions.
And they go through to them, also if this means that they didn't mean they don't get all their homework and therefore no good crown.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just just to work. Carl gave to work. Carl gave than any day, where in the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There's a married place that I mean, where WiFi the go.
I don't smp true because I want to love to me.
But good, that huge choices of work in that we are going to be able to ask us in the way we go to work on the time, or we go to work or not.
We can look at a footballow of our son son the soon of our office, and our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop of school.
And even if they all except everybody every minutes of that wedn't every minute, "Sall I ask this phone of the question?
And I write on this emailt your long? Sole I write this letter?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience the footballow the soon on a very different way.
And what we look at the big, the large, the small, materialistic business, lifestyle, lifestyle.
And this is what the world is asked out.
There were a questions, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world is now extension.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad this?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is really good about is bad about what is bad about what is bad about bad about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on human being.
A very content effect is that the earlier is that the earlier than completely than completely
And with so many choices are possibilities to make a choice to make a choice
I give you a very dramatic example of investiguous pensive to investigation,
A colleaguard of me to investment data from Vanguard, a big policy-in-in-in-in-basically society of a million working about 2,000 stigations.
And she discovered that for every 10 polition that worked the work of the work of the work two percent of the debenefits two percent of the work two percent of the before.
And in five-five-five percent less worknemers are benemers than five five five five five five five five five five five five of five five five five five five five five five five five of five five five five five five five done per
Because it at five-five-five-five-five-edge to choice that people just extend to the next day, and that I think of it.
And of the expensive is coming down.
That didn't mean that people who are not just dream to eath a dream because they didn't have enough money because they didn't have enough the choice as the choice as she did knowledge for them.
And they were lots of the same through 5,000 dollars a year on their nose before to go on the nose
The worked was namely to double their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contributed to double.
So many choice can work a lot of choice
And I think the world there is so from there.
If it to the eterness the eterness is going to make the right choices, right?
You don't want to be ship with the wrong fundress the wrong fundress the wrong three of the wrong dress the wrong three of the wrong dress the wrong three of the wrong three of the wrong three skults.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the distinct the result of our dedicated and choose eventually less text less teval, with the result of the result of the result of the result of us would be less options as we had less optive.
There are member reasons for it.
One of the choice, for example, for example, for example, the back of the choice, and the choice was not perfect perfect was not perfect perfect
You stelt your case would be better for that another choice would be better better better of the choice better would be better better for that a different choice better would be better.
This three alternative alternative shes that you get to get from your choice.
And then does break on the choice of the choice that you have made a good choice that you were a good choice.
The more options of the easy is to easier to have the primary of unaverse of eight which is eight eight eight be option.
A second reason of substitutives.
And then Gilbert compared from the morning of how often we depended the value of the things we depended them equired of the things that we can see them.
If you can alternatives in, you can already already quickly already soon of all the alternatives that your wdest.
That makes you have less teved to the alternative that you have cosozed it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streak of this example.
This is a basically on the Hampt one.
They have a dure second wound.
They are sat a beautiful strand. Straling weather. No human beautiful.
Don't do any? "Ford." "Fordickie," thinks that man, "It's augght --
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city.
I could put my car, for the door,
And he is really two weeks to simmes, with the idea that he every day again, a great parking of mission of mission of the front of course.
Substitutives are going to be cost of the folish, even if we have from our choices of our choice choices
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are alternatives.
And that presents us as substitutives.
Anyway.
This is pictures to a number of points.
Life in the here and now is now and you don't have to continue to the affect of the time.
And one thing thing thing is that you have to every choices of the choices of choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of every choices of the so.
And all of that other has been so been so his attractives that the coshows option less attractives.
And third is the escalation of expections.
I was found through this during at the search to a new broad.
I always nearly speaking alway.
Because was only one species, and you know, the coast, and that coade, and you know, the big, it doesn't set unbelievable, but if you do the broke long enough and often the broke of enough and often enough and often enough the right only OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new new thing.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a speedle, this is my sing."
And the mally, "Will said, "Will you smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed easy fit or relaxed easy failed or relaxed fit or relaxed fit
Do you or a ritis? While was? While was?
Do you have a broak with sist effect?
You know, you know, something expensive pipipating pipile." And so he went down." And so he was just through it do.
I was speaking it. Now, I was a while, I want to say, "I want to the only broken that early was."
He had no idea that was no idea and so I have a hour long all the possible broeks of all the possible broak of the broak of the broak of the broak of the broak of the broak of the broak of the broak of the broak that
And I just so, the wink of the winel eventually eventually with a broak of pass brow.
I had better better this. I had to do it better better to do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? To this on myself from miyself from me, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better freed, I was that I started more expectly expect to expect a good speeds.
I started without any expection, because I just started to expect a bit of know.
And then it turns out that there were different and one of the time of the perfect.
And what I was cower well. But not perfect.
And so I was a lot of my broek with my broek expectation, and that stelebrated me to me my broak me
The more possibilities of people have expectations about the purpossibilities about the results of those possibilities.
And that means are less tevilless tevilless teves, even if it's good results are good results of it.
Marketing people don't know this thing.
Because in that case, you don't know where I now talk about now
And it is really about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was bad of people were surprising experienced to have experienced to have experiences.
In our modern society as well-various burgers are expecting perfection of the best thing we can reach is that something so good as we could reach expect as we had expected to be expectly expected as well.
Now, we are surprising affect because our expections, my expectation, my expectation,

I didn't have a her with less tevaccounter.
But with less enough less enough his good cans.
And finally, why you can bad a bad sit of a bad speed speed as only one of preciate as one of preciate being you wonder why you can bask you how unted.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks away, and you buy a bit turns out to fall, who is then answer?
The answer is just so simple. That's so simple. That's you.
You could make a better choice a better choice.
Well, you don't have a except different broeks you don't have excisions.
So if people decision of those decision of those decision of that decision of these decision of choice.
And they take themselves quality.
In the Western society depression of the young generations of the young generations high air.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive to, in this explosion of depression of depression of depression of the experience of the experience of the experiences.
And if they try to explains that television for themselves the widdle well.
So the ntoresultain is that we objective on objective on the fellow of this, but our bad us bad bad of it.
Now, a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for everybody to be continue.
But that's not.
It doesn't seem to choose that can't choose better than not choose is not neither than follows doesn't do better better is more choices of choices is better than better of the choices of the better of the better of the better of the better is not better than automatically better than the choices of the se
There's a magic bounds. Well, I don't know electric fooms of choice.
But I know that we have all long for the point that choice is that choice for us.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost almost -- a principle -- a principle that we can love us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can like the best of us -- I am almost almost of us -- I am almost almost of the best of the best of the best of it.
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material countries.
There are many places on the world, we have earlier all about before the problem is not so much choice is that there is a lot of choice.
And the paradox I speak here with name for the moderne, wn, wonderful West.
That's frustrated and this is frustrated -- Steve Levitt you went to installow and did stified that children are not help. Sive Levitt of your money.
I say you know, the same thing, intrainary, intrainary choices -- they don't help -- they don't help anyway.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices were behaving to country to have a little bit of the people have been reflect of that people are going to be able to before that people are living on forward to behave.

And finally, if you read this imagine, you know, a imagine, you know, as a developed human says, "Ach, what does do you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a visual."
A writical image, a shortist of the world-picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the time I did to better that this fish is a smart smart is a smart smart is a smart smart is smart smart is a smart of the smart of the smart of the time.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you break the fish to create possibility, but leave you no freedom, but leave you don't have freedom, but again.
If you put the visual break to create possibilities, you can get less tevace.
It leads to more lost of more lowing and less teving.
Everybody has a fish.
This is freedom, for a certainly -- possible for the fish, but for us.
But the way the well-figured figure, infish to ask forward, unclear, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
