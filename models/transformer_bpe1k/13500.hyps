The se@@ con@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on the N@@ or@@ d@@ p@@ op@@ le is in the c@@ l@@ op@@ p@@ ing har@@ t of our g@@ lo@@ b@@ al c@@ li@@ m@@ ate sy@@ st@@ em@@ .

In 2@@ 5 years is the year@@ , this is the one of this to this is the c@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ y.
And that's a proble@@ m because the be@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ le of the N@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ar@@ y I@@ J@@ s@@ he was a very gre@@ at of the N@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ar@@ y and a very gre@@ at f@@ re@@ e@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ y of the un@@ i@@ ma@@ l or in@@ cre@@ di@@ a of c@@ oo@@ r and the de@@ e@@ p of th@@ r@@ or@@ e in me@@ th@@ an@@ , by the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss in me@@ th@@ an@@ .

Wh@@ en we have se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ d, it was from the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y, to the di@@ g@@ it@@ al worl@@ d.
No@@ w we tr@@ y to as@@ k to as@@ k f@@ ra@@ gen@@ er@@ ate re@@ gen@@ er@@ ate or new lif@@ e of this di@@ g@@ it@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ ?
This is the ma@@ p@@ s of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m, M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a gen@@ it@@ al@@ i@@ u@@ m@@ a kind of of s@@ m@@ a kind of of s@@ m@@ us@@ t to a kind of a kind of that things that s@@ m@@ sel@@ f in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ ation@@ .
And we tr@@ y to look like we tr@@ y to look like a n@@ ic@@ e or we can get a n@@ ic@@ e to get a little b@@ it of in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le@@ .
We can be in the or@@ der of the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d from the 5@@ 00 or so that 5@@ 00 or or so are going to be in the or@@ der of the 5@@ 00 or that are differ@@ ent or so differ@@ en@@ t.
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly to the me@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , which is r@@ un@@ e with the s@@ un@@ e.
G@@ el@@ y me@@ , this is si@@ m@@ pl@@ y is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ y.
But when we look at all the gen@@ es of all of the gen@@ es that we can look at the p@@ er of these p@@ er and s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, it's very un@@ ti@@ m@@ es, it's a b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , it's a lif@@ e that this was a lif@@ e of the c@@ el@@ l op@@ le@@ ver@@ .
We de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to be the on@@ ly r@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ b@@ le to the on@@ ly of this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing sy@@ n@@ th@@ is@@ su@@ e that we could be the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts to the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts to be so that we could be so to be a comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ ly to be a fe@@ w of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ ons to be able to st@@ il@@ l to st@@ at@@ e.
And we star@@ ted with qu@@ al@@ es with qu@@ est@@ i@@ ons of qu@@ al@@ k@@ en we a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ?
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver been very gre@@ at mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ts that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver been s@@ een f@@ ar@@ m@@ ?
A@@ n@@ d, if we can do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ s@@ oo@@ m "@@ op@@ st@@ ar@@ y "@@ op@@ st@@ ar@@ y "@@ op@@ st@@ ar@@ y "@@ e@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e is tr@@ us@@ t to bu@@ il@@ d a stu@@ f@@ f of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So, our te@@ m@@ p@@ o of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ing is the lif@@ e of lif@@ e is on ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al of lif@@ e.
O@@ u@@ r to be the ne@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al co@@ de of lo@@ t of lo@@ w@@ ing c@@ all the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be c@@ all of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be c@@ lo@@ w@@ .
And our l@@ ast p@@ un@@ t would c@@ ur@@ v@@ y on this m@@ om@@ ent of a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
W@@ e@@ 're here are 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ ,
Th@@ ere were a c@@ it@@ ies for no@@ di@@ a for no@@ di@@ g@@ , with a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic@@ al de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e is to be the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e is to be mu@@ ch@@ .
Th@@ ere are su@@ sta@@ in@@ able to be a s@@ m@@ un@@ ity in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the s@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s, 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to be the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ing and so the p@@ ie@@ ce of the wor@@ ld is how you know, the f@@ ol@@ d that are going to be the f@@ oun@@ ts are going to be the f@@ ou@@ ts of the wor@@ ld that are going to be able to be the s@@ m@@ us@@ t be a f@@ ou@@ ts of the wor@@ ld that are going to be able to be a
So we had to make a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ing for the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ at@@ es and the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ at@@ ing of all the f@@ ol@@ t@@ s.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ ing, to the first po@@ g@@ in@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ om@@ ic of the gen@@ om@@ ou@@ s P@@ h@@ i 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little b@@ it that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a that b@@ it of b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a is the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a of b@@ it of bac@@ ter@@ i@@ ze that b@@ as@@ ic@@ s.
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ s to the p@@ ie@@ ce of the f@@ ol@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ or@@ rec@@ ti@@ r@@ c@@ or@@ rec@@ ti@@ c@@ tion@@ .
and had a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing a little of the b@@ it of in@@ er@@ s in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a of the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a of the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a c@@ oun@@ t@@ ic@@ al co@@ de and f@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ or@@ y and f@@ ir@@ c@@ tion@@ s.
The f@@ ir@@ l worl@@ d@@ s, they were going to be able to c@@ ell@@ s, they were from c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ame from c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ame bac@@ k and the E@@ .
I was in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le with the ol@@ ic@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ y, and I sa@@ id they sa@@ id they had to g@@ ood s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing that they had to g@@ ood s@@ n@@ ap@@ t@@ s.
They are more than you@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we think this sit@@ u@@ ation is where the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are har@@ d@@ w@@ are bu@@ il@@ ding in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to do something that a lo@@ t of gre@@ at@@ s.
We wan@@ ted to bu@@ il@@ d the ne@@ x@@ t b@@ us@@ in@@ ess b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally bu@@ il@@ ding
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ t@@ c c@@ o@@ de@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we could bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ or@@ s of f@@ ir@@ us@@ s@@ es, so that we could f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s --
And to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s are a li@@ ving c@@ el@@ l comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a li@@ v@@ ed c@@ el@@ l comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a li@@ v@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n is c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ t with di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter than that comp@@ u@@ ter than that is to be ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l is very in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ di@@ sc@@ over@@ ing ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in the comp@@ u@@ ter than ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@
Wh@@ en we c@@ all the first gen@@ om@@ ent was in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 was the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 was the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d p@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ s.
A@@ s of the in@@ di@@ c@@ tion we were al@@ so the re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion 3@@ 0 f@@ our f@@ ol@@ t@@ y s@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ ze that we had the wa@@ s@@ n't us@@ t to st@@ o@@ p the wa@@ s@@ n't have to st@@ o@@ p in the wa@@ y.
O@@ u@@ r par@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n@@ s of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ s that are to be l@@ on@@ g with all of other stu@@ di@@ es that are to all of other stu@@ f@@ f with all of other stu@@ c@@ k with the other stu@@ p@@ p@@ s of the stu@@ f@@ f of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ s to bu@@ il@@ d that they can bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d them to bu@@ il@@ d the@@ m.
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ s to un@@ der@@ st@@ and her@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have wat@@ er in the wat@@ er of wat@@ er in the wat@@ er of wat@@ er in st@@ op@@ .
B@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ e, we have a f@@ our se@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ de@@ : A@@ , C@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ s that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for sp@@ ac@@ e for sp@@ ac@@ e for sp@@ ac@@ e 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e -- and it a little b@@ it -- there is a little b@@ it of c@@ alle@@ d for a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for sp@@ ac@@ e.
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al to w@@ r@@ it@@ e the gen@@ e@@ t@@ al to w@@ r@@ it@@ e the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ or@@ t@@ s.
A@@ an@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ ed "@@ m@@ i@@ le@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were were f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ ge@@ s that there were no an@@ y@@ c@@ ed that there were no an@@ y@@ c@@ e.
We have this stu@@ f@@ f this stu@@ f@@ f that we can op@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ ze that we can op@@ en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s.
Th@@ ere are these are these are f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s that they are in e@@ ac@@ h and in e@@ ac@@ h c@@ oun@@ t of c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .

And it's just just just st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of the ec@@ tion@@ .
We can be a b@@ it for lif@@ e for lif@@ e for lif@@ e for lif@@ e to li@@ v@@ at@@ or@@ y s@@ k@@ il@@ y or pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , or pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , so so so so so so so so so so so ex@@ c@@ in@@ ce of the lif@@ e pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , so so so so so so so so so so so so so ex@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ in@@ ce of lif@@ e --
This is a sc@@ re@@ en@@ ce of what what is a little b@@ it of what is to de@@ sig@@ n that we wor@@ king on the wor@@ k@@ s, and so you can really wor@@ k on the wor@@ k@@ s, you can really get the par@@ t of the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new kind of comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new kind of comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new kind of comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new kind of comp@@ u@@ ter and a new kind of comp@@ u@@ ter of comp@@ u@@ ter and a new kind of comp@@ u@@ ter in the wor@@ k@@ s.
We don't know how it will look like to look like to look like to look like to look like it from it.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al o@@ ff@@ ic@@ s from the s@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
We are no@@ w on our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our b@@ il@@ it@@ y.
O@@ u@@ r have you to b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , you know, just b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , just a s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of ex@@ per@@ men@@ t.
We have the se@@ con@@ d gen@@ er@@ ation and the h@@ igh@@ -@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ k that in@@ si@@ de of that are going to be able to be su@@ g@@ ic@@ ul@@ at@@ ing from su@@ g@@ ar@@ y and more h@@ ig@@ er@@ , or more than h@@ ig@@ ur@@ e or differ@@ ent k@@ in@@ ds of b@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the on@@ ly way we think that that bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing the f@@ oo@@ d@@ le of the f@@ oo@@ d@@ ge of the f@@ oo@@ d@@ 's f@@ oo@@ m and the be@@ c@@ ame as we are al@@ so in@@ c@@ ess is as as we star@@ ted to be the be@@ g@@ an with C@@ O@@ 2 as we are very be@@ g@@ an to de@@ sig@@ n that the first of the first that we are very be@@ ing to do the first of the first of the first gen@@ er@@ ation that the first gen@@ er@@ ation that we are in@@ cre@@ ate the first gen@@ er@@ ation of the first gen@@ er@@ ation that the first gen@@ er@@ ation to do the first gen@@ er@@ ation of the first in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ il@@ able to be f@@ oo@@ t to do the first f@@ ood and the first f@@ oo@@ d.
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ o@@ d -- by our worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ , we all all all the things we have all the wa@@ ys of other other other me@@ th@@ o@@ .
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m we have a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It was a f@@ i@@ ve in the de@@ p@@ ri@@ c se@@ e, about 2@@ .@@ 5 m@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ , with c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d of c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ or@@ n@@ ing of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
It ma@@ k@@ es that ma@@ de from C@@ O@@ 2 with C@@ O@@ 2 of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar s@@ ho@@ w@@ s like en@@ er@@ g@@ y as en@@ er@@ g@@ y as en@@ er@@ g@@ y as en@@ er@@ g@@ y as en@@ er@@ g@@ y.
W@@ e@@ 're going to look at the c@@ alle@@ d C@@ O@@ 2 ne@@ m@@ s, what ma@@ k@@ es are f@@ ab@@ r@@ y to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ c@@ es to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ s, where C@@ O@@ 2 and the O@@ 2 and the C@@ O@@ 2 and the O@@ 2 and the pro@@ c@@ ess to be able to be able to be able to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ac@@ e this pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess to f@@ i@@ p@@ les to the pro@@ c@@ ess to p@@ ut this pro@@ c@@ ess to be able to f@@ ab@@ r@@ y to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ies to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ d to
So in a c@@ or@@ t time@@ , we think we think we think in it@@ s that in it@@ s we are in the b@@ ra@@ l qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
We have a s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, you know, you have the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ d the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y and the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y to re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ , you do@@ , what do th@@ ing, where you do do th@@ is@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n be@@ com@@ es to be be@@ ing in@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ n
But we al@@ so are al@@ so the us@@ ing of these wor@@ k@@ tu@@ re@@ s to think of these wor@@ k@@ er@@ s.
This was the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , we c@@ all the s@@ ame as a c@@ alle@@ d the fac@@ t of the be@@ h@@ in@@ d on the r@@ ight f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that chan@@ ge can make chan@@ ge by te@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s com@@ b@@ in@@ it@@ y.
H@@ ere you can see how the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ s are going to be going to be the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a of sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic@@ al ac@@ t@@ or@@ s with e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of e@@ ar@@ y e@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally in@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , and e@@ ven@@ tu@@ re@@ .
W@@ e@@ 're more f@@ ar@@ ly a@@ ga@@ in@@ ing of hu@@ man@@ s.
O@@ u@@ r is sa@@ id, we do a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do that ma@@ king a b@@ it of lif@@ e to do that ma@@ king a little b@@ it of th@@ ing.
Wh@@ at I want to s@@ how you to s@@ how to s@@ how you is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, is a f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, we have a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t a ye@@ ar ye@@ ar a@@ go@@ . This is a ye@@ ar ye@@ ar a@@ go@@ .
And it's a com@@ ing of that in the wa@@ y, or of the c@@ lo@@ c@@ al or on the in@@ f@@ is@@ u@@ al d@@ at@@ a and f@@ is@@ u@@ al d@@ at@@ a ar@@ t of v@@ is@@ u@@ al d@@ at@@ a ar@@ t.
We look at man@@ y of man@@ y g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ s and then here are going to be here and here and then here and then then here and then then here and no@@ w and can be here and and and then s@@ he di@@ d to our c@@ or@@ ter@@ s and s@@ m@@ us@@ , and c@@ or@@ ter@@ s to our w@@ ent to our w@@ al@@ k to our w@@ al@@ k to our en@@ c@@ or@@ ter@@ s to our w@@ ent to our w@@ is@@ su@@ e and the s@@ m@@ it@@ al c@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ al c@@ or@@ t and then then we can get to the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e and can get to our en@@ g@@ it@@ al c@
And it ma@@ k@@ es that we are in@@ form@@ ation to be able to be able to be how to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be how to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able or e@@ i@@ ma@@ ge@@ s or e@@ i@@ ma@@ ge@@ s or be@@ ing el@@ se@@ .
The most of the n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ ber@@ s or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ ber@@ e@@ ."
It ma@@ de all of the pre@@ st@@ ati@@ ons because it would be pre@@ st@@ ati@@ ons would be pre@@ st@@ ati@@ ons on a th@@ is, on a th@@ is, on a th@@ is, on a th@@ ough of the s@@ ame p@@ i@@ x@@ al p@@ i@@ x@@ es on the sch@@ oo@@ l@@ .
It's al@@ so a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ l ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a f@@ ul@@ l@@ y, a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of that@@ , a d@@ oe@@ s of that@@ , you kno@@ w@@ .
This is gra@@ v@@ it@@ e by D@@ ic@@ k@@ s. E@@ l@@ ac@@ h c@@ ol@@ e is a lo@@ t of f@@ un@@ c@@ le@@ d to a lo@@ t of f@@ ar@@ .
And to be a b@@ it of the wor@@ ld that it is a b@@ it of the be@@ c@@ ame is not a c@@ ir@@ c@@ le of th@@ is, we can see something that this is really te@@ x@@ t that this is not really a be@@ t@@ ter of this is not really a be@@ t@@ ing.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be this is a se@@ con@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on is a re@@ al b@@ oo@@ k, to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing a b@@ oo@@ k.
I di@@ d@@ n't know it was a b@@ it of man@@ y
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ am@@ ple@@ . This is a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ . This is a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
E@@ very gre@@ at is the gre@@ at is the be@@ g@@ in@@ ation of a par@@ t of a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar is the star@@ t of a par@@ t.
This is a b@@ it of the pl@@ ac@@ e of a re@@ al p@@ ap@@ er of a re@@ al p@@ ap@@ er of a ch@@ ic@@ e of a s@@ ing@@ le or c@@ r@@ oo@@ m or c@@ ran@@ t, or a s@@ al@@ so a s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the sc@@ al@@ e is a sc@@ al@@ e of the re@@ al is that a sc@@ al@@ e of the pl@@ ac@@ e is a sc@@ al@@ e of a sc@@ al@@ e of a re@@ al p@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
We al@@ so have something with the am@@ oun@@ t of these ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed a ne@@ ar@@ t re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of h@@ ig@@ h -- man@@ y h@@ ig@@ er than a n@@ or@@ ma@@ l re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es -- we have ex@@ tr@@ a b@@ it of h@@ ig@@ h -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ a b@@ it of h@@ ig@@ h -- we have ex@@ tr@@ a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
I@@ f you wan@@ ted to look at this au@@ t@@ or the au@@ t@@ or s@@ ho@@ w@@ s you see it her@@ e.
O@@ r other other other other thing that or or even th@@ is, or even th@@ ough the te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ al spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ as can really really really really really really for s@@ ha@@ p@@ e that we can do the per@@ c@@ ti@@ ons of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the s@@ ame sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ t@@ s.
We h@@ op@@ en that this is not a p@@ ic@@ k more than an@@ other other other other other other people are going to be more th@@ is, not not no@@ w -- not ne@@ ed -- not not not no@@ w -- not ne@@ e@@ de@@ d -- not not ne@@ e@@ de@@ d -- not not not ne@@ e@@ de@@ .
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , a l@@ and@@ s for the h@@ and a h@@ and a h@@ and a technolog@@ y as I will be a de@@ f@@ ic@@ e for a technolog@@ y as I will al@@ so have been here to pl@@ a@@ y that we can al@@ so have a lo@@ t of b@@ us@@ in@@ ess that we can al@@ so man@@ y to be a lo@@ t of b@@ us@@ in@@ ess that we can al@@ so man@@ y b@@ us@@ in@@ ess that we can al@@ so man@@ y of the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess to the h@
The@@ se are all we@@ a@@ ve in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in the f@@ ir@@ st of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A c@@ oun@@ t of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A A@@ S@@ A A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's no@@ w look at something like that@@ .
This is tr@@ us@@ t to be li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ jec@@ t@@ ; you can look at the W@@ e@@ b@@ jec@@ t.
This pro@@ jec@@ t is P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ e@@ e@@ p with el@@ ec@@ t@@ ly in@@ .
A@@ n@@ er@@ 's S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on and it's a very very comp@@ u@@ ter comp@@ u@@ ter comp@@ u@@ ter by N@@ a@@ h f@@ is@@ i@@ on by N@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ , by S@@ te@@ x@@ t of the U@@ .@@ .@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ U@@ .@@ .@@ .
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ r@@ sel@@ f@@ -@@ s@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ ch@@ . A m@@ om@@ ic@@ al worl@@ d.
So this is a li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de by S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this do@@ , we do this do@@ , we see the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ il@@ y f@@ ar@@ s.
The sp@@ ac@@ e of the un@@ der@@ st@@ ic@@ ation has been her@@ e.
The comp@@ u@@ ter f@@ is@@ i@@ on is that these i@@ ma@@ s have these k@@ il@@ l@@ s of these k@@ il@@ l@@ s are b@@ ra@@ in@@ s of the e@@ ac@@ h -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ i L@@ a@@ k@@ es -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ i L@@ a@@ k@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ s -- and all these are s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s are all these thing@@ s.
I don't know if you don't know an@@ other time if there is an@@ other time@@ s that we di@@ d to c@@ all of other time@@ .
Th@@ ere are more sp@@ ac@@ e that are man@@ y sp@@ ac@@ e.
I want to s@@ how a N@@ a@@ h@@ 's sp@@ ron@@ t of a N@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ pro@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ t@@ al -- and this is to the re@@ al c@@ or@@ t of the way I have the te@@ ac@@ h of my he@@ ad in my he@@ ad of the wa@@ ys of the wa@@ y, with the way of the te@@ ch@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es on our te@@ ch@@ e@@ ac@@ h of the we@@ b@@ sit@@ y on our we@@ igh@@ t@@ ?
We had to f@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ ation with the a@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ s.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e with F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . You know, the F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . You just just just just just N@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y N@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ s, and you get a c@@ r@@ , and you get the c@@ am@@ p@@ les of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ ally in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ ally the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ les of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ en the c@@ am@@ p@@ il@@ e of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ y D@@ an@@ y D@@ y D@@ am@@ e@@ e D
And e@@ very time you know this or@@ an@@ g@@ ing a de@@ al of this or@@ an@@ g@@ ing that there are a par@@ t of this par@@ t of this mo@@ de@@ l that are par@@ t of this mo@@ de@@ .
And so these are all of these are c@@ alle@@ d F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, that these way to be on this sp@@ ac@@ e.
And we can be on si@@ m@@ pl@@ y on the si@@ mp@@ le of n@@ a@@ v@@ ig@@ er@@ s.
No@@ w, I ne@@ ver had ne@@ ver th@@ ough@@ t I ne@@ ver th@@ ough@@ t I ne@@ ver th@@ ough@@ t to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t would wor@@ k.
It's a c@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s of that is so so so so so so so so it is so so so so so so so so so so so so it is so so so so so so so so mu@@ ch of this is so so so so mu@@ ch of this di@@ sc@@ over@@ .
I bel@@ ie@@ ve that you can see that this man@@ y c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's s@@ ho@@ w@@ s are all of g@@ s@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, and a gre@@ at re@@ f@@ le@@ x@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a gre@@ at t@@ at@@ ch of c@@ at@@ e@@ d, a gre@@ at this wa@@ y.
I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d what f@@ em@@ it@@ i@@ ze what f@@ i@@ el@@ d to fin@@ d the me@@ an@@ .
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch more de@@ c@@ ide@@ d by th@@ r@@ ough and mon@@ e@@ y and s@@ oun@@ t of th@@ is.
E@@ r@@ gen@@ s her@@ e, a s@@ ame s@@ ame as a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ s --
This is even a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e who are g@@ ood g@@ ood by the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e who are g@@ ood by the pro@@ gra@@ m ma@@ .
I@@ f we have f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our c@@ le@@ ar in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ al c@@ as@@ i@@ ze of these v@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y is that we can really do with the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al thing that we can use the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al en@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ al -- of the d@@ at@@ a -- the wh@@ ol@@ e c@@ alle@@ d the A@@ ar@@ t of the ar@@ ound the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ ly of the ar@@ ound that all of the worl@@ d, and the A@@ ar@@ t of the e@@ ac@@ h of the worl@@ d, and op@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ t of the things that we are no@@ w to be us@@ ing the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al c@@ oun@@ t of the un@@ c@@ oun@@ t of it.
A@@ l@@ l of these p@@ ic@@ tu@@ s are a very b@@ it of c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, and a wh@@ at's very mu@@ ch more than the s@@ ame than the s@@ ame thing is to the s@@ ame of the si@@ ze of the si@@ ze of the si@@ ze of the si@@ ze of the si@@ ze of the si@@ ze of the si@@ ze of the si@@ x of the si@@ x of the par@@ t@@ y.
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that from the wh@@ ol@@ e A@@ ar@@ d the de@@ st@@ it@@ y.
S@@ te@@ p@@ e of S@@ te@@ p@@ h@@ and L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's wor@@ k the U@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .
And this is something gre@@ w in comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity when it use the us@@ ing as the v@@ al@@ so the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of the people who are al@@ so the us@@ ing us@@ ed for people that the us@@ .
H@@ u@@ n f@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of me@@ t@@ ap@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a that some@@ one el@@ se@@ .

L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ k about the h@@ ou@@ se of the hu@@ man@@ , it was s@@ in@@ c@@ e.
Th@@ er@@ e's a time time that you can be a f@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ d e@@ very au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally as po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of as po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and so s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en be@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.

No@@ w you w@@ al@@ k for the op@@ po@@ in@@ t of the op@@ po@@ in@@ t for the op@@ po@@ in@@ t of the op@@ po@@ in@@ t of the op@@ po@@ in@@ t.
I me@@ an@@ , I was al@@ so in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t of s@@ un@@ der in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t of min@@ d s@@ he was very s@@ hu@@ ge than f@@ i@@ ve le@@ ss than f@@ i@@ ve h@@ om@@ e.
They are not d@@ om@@ b@@ er or a@@ i@@ ma@@ l or li@@ k@@ e, or li@@ k@@ e, or s@@ he was in f@@ a@@ i@@ l of time@@ .
No@@ w, they have the d@@ ru@@ c@@ k with ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es and ma@@ k@@ ing.
"@@ S@@ e@@ e tr@@ an@@ s@@ s@@ ? S@@ he di@@ se@@ ?

The@@ se are all of these are s@@ ha@@ p@@ ing qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ s.
They are going to go by a an@@ s@@ wer@@ , if this be@@ t@@ ter that they di@@ d@@ n't have their hu@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, they have no g@@ ood c@@ r@@ it@@ ing their h@@ al@@ .
And they have s@@ ame im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ t. It is im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ t.
And then we have to wor@@ k with C@@ ar@@ l ga@@ ve that technolog@@ y in our c@@ ity to be st@@ ate to us to be able to be able to be e@@ ac@@ h el@@ se@@ , where the wor@@ ld -- in the R@@ and@@ ar@@ ly da@@ y -- where the wor@@ ld -- in the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h Ho@@ w do in the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h Ho@@ tel@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's one pl@@ ac@@ e that I me@@ an@@ , which I he@@ ar@@ d the W@@ i@@ F@@ i the F@@ i the F@@ i the F@@ i the d@@ oo@@ d.
I di@@ d@@ n't want to be because I want to be pl@@ ac@@ e for m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ .
But g@@ ood ch@@ o@@ ic@@ ally ch@@ o@@ ic@@ s of wor@@ k that we are in our st@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ it@@ y, we are going to go at the st@@ ra@@ w@@ n@@ , or no@@ w we no@@ w no@@ w or no@@ t. or no@@ w we no@@ w no@@ w@@ he@@ ther we no@@ t. or no@@ w we are no@@ w@@ he@@ ther no@@ w@@ .
We can go to a f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ we@@ d@@ 's loo@@ king at our s@@ on@@ e, with our s@@ oo@@ l@@ s of our s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and our B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ r@@ y to the other other other other other other an@@ c@@ oun@@ t, and our s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of our s@@ ho@@ w@@ s on the s@@ k@@ in@@ e.

Wh@@ at we al@@ so look at the s@@ m@@ all the lar@@ ge@@ , it s@@ m@@ all mat@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ ist@@ ic sa@@ w it is a we@@ st@@ , it was a we@@ st@@ i@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld was going to look at the worl@@ d.
Th@@ ere were what c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ it@@ y, but not ever@@ y@@ thing was a c@@ alle@@ d of c@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
And the wor@@ ld no@@ w is the worl@@ d.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is what is w@@ he@@ ther this g@@ ood or s@@ k@@ ?
And the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is@@ : "@@ Y@@ e@@ a@@ ."
We know what g@@ oe@@ s all the g@@ ood is what I was going to tal@@ k about what I was going to tal@@ k about what what is is going to tal@@ k about what what it is going to tal@@ k about what is is happ@@ en@@ .
Th@@ at's en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s two ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two in@@ cre@@ as@@ e of f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man be@@ ing on the hu@@ man
A very ex@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ ally f@@ ec@@ t is that it was f@@ re@@ a@@ k to the first thing that it was be@@ ing be@@ ing be@@ ing be@@ ing f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And with so so so mu@@ ch ch@@ o@@ ic@@ ally as a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make it as a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e they could make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e s@@ he was to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e s@@ he was to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
I me@@ an@@ , I think this very very qu@@ ic@@ al ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of in@@ ve@@ st@@ ing in f@@ re@@ e s@@ ho@@ en@@ si@@ o@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ s.
A c@@ or@@ t of me c@@ ra@@ ther to in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment to in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment to in@@ ve@@ st@@ er@@ s of V@@ an@@ g@@ u@@ ar@@ d, a gre@@ at im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ it@@ y, a bi@@ g b@@ us@@ in@@ ess with about 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on wor@@ k@@ s.
S@@ he di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that for e@@ very s@@ ing@@ s@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ le@@ d the wor@@ k@@ s, the wor@@ k@@ s, the de@@ al of the wor@@ k@@ ld --
A@@ s they f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ ve and de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to be a per@@ c@@ ent of le@@ ss and le@@ ss than f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve and de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve and had been in f@@ i@@ ve to f@@ i@@ ve the f@@ i@@ ve of the f@@ i@@ ve of f@@ i@@ ve of th@@ is@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it to the f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ ve to the people who are just just just just just loo@@ king at the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y, and that people just just just c@@ ame to the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y, and that the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y, and that the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y, and it was so so so so so so so so so so so so so that it was so so so so so so so so so the people of the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y@@ s.
And of ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s not on@@ ly their p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es because they don't have en@@ ough to have en@@ ough because they don't have gen@@ ough they have en@@ ough to re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed because they di@@ d@@ n't al@@ so that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e was so that they di@@ d to have the wor@@ k@@ s.
And that they were lo@@ v@@ ed 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to be their ne@@ u@@ st@@ s to be their ne@@ u@@ s.
The wor@@ k@@ y was f@@ er to be their o@@ wn b@@ ir@@ d to their o@@ wn b@@ i@@ d@@ ra@@ ge their b@@ il@@ it@@ y.
And so man@@ y ch@@ o@@ ic@@ ally a lo@@ t of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e was going to be f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And I think the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld is so so so so that the wor@@ ld is so so so s@@ ic@@ k@@ ing.
I@@ f it was going to go to the cen@@ tur@@ y is very b@@ ig@@ n@@ ess you want to look very mu@@ ch the r@@ ight ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ s,
You di@@ d@@ n't want to be the f@@ un@@ c@@ it@@ ies with the f@@ un@@ c@@ it@@ ies or even the f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or even the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ ame thing was the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ ame thing the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ ame th@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ation@@ .
Th@@ at's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t. It is that we@@ e@@ d the ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t is that we@@ 've al@@ so been al@@ so f@@ a@@ il@@ able to de@@ sc@@ al@@ e our s@@ oc@@ c@@ ur@@ e and c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, and they di@@ d the ca@@ se@@ , it was al@@ re@@ s@@ ul@@ t to the ca@@ se@@ , it was a s@@ ul@@ t@@ le@@ ss of the ca@@ se@@ .
Th@@ at's a me@@ an@@ s of th@@ is, to do for f@@ ir@@ d for f@@ ir@@ d for f@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ er re@@ a@@ k@@ s.
A@@ n that there is a h@@ om@@ e of that there is a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, from the s@@ k@@ in@@ ds of the s@@ ing@@ s, they di@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ing@@ s, they di@@ d@@ n't know that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e was not the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the wa@@ s.
You st@@ il@@ e in this ca@@ se@@ , you know, all of an@@ other ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e for an@@ other ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e would be be@@ t@@ ter as w@@ ell@@ .
This is th@@ re@@ e the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve s@@ k@@ il@@ y for you get to you to you get to you you get to pl@@ y ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And then the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , the ne@@ x@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e wa@@ s.
Ho@@ w more op@@ ti@@ ons are going to be able to be a b@@ it of the s@@ k@@ il@@ y to have to be the sp@@ i@@ re@@ d to be a little b@@ it of the d@@ at@@ h of the d@@ at@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ o@@ z@@ en op@@ tion@@ .
A se@@ con@@ d re@@ as@@ on to su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ .
Th@@ at's what we have been f@@ ound the v@@ a@@ il@@ ber@@ t of the things we are going to do the things that the things that are like to do the things that we are like the things that the things that are like the things that we are happ@@ in@@ ess of things that are happ@@ in@@ ess to the things that we are like to look at the things that that we are happ@@ in@@ ing.
I@@ f you can see man@@ y man@@ y al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es you can al@@ so see all of all of all the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es of all the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es that you are al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es you al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es you can see the se@@ con@@ c@@ tion@@ .
Th@@ at ma@@ de that you have le@@ ss the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you c@@ o@@ se@@ s you have s@@ ho@@ sp@@ e.
A@@ s a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , the N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s of you@@ '@@ ll c@@ all of you@@ 're lo@@ w@@ .
This is a little b@@ it of this ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , this is the ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
This is a f@@ a@@ il@@ e in the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ on@@ s.
They have a d@@ ur@@ e we@@ e@@ d a t@@ oo@@ l@@ .
They were going to be a p@@ ra@@ ch@@ ic@@ e st@@ ran@@ ge@@ , S@@ tr@@ an@@ s@@ ing a hu@@ man@@ s in a hu@@ man@@ s.
A@@ n@@ d, you can@@ 't think "@@ D@@ o you know, "@@ V@@ er@@ di@@ c@@ k@@ y@@ " "@@ is the au@@ g@@ u@@ st@@ us@@ .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy in M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an is the c@@ it@@ y.

And he se@@ e@@ m two we@@ e@@ ks with the ide@@ a that he was a gre@@ at that he was very an@@ other par@@ k@@ er of par@@ k@@ ing.
S@@ u@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ , and c@@ o@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ , we have our ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to our ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e they make a gre@@ at ch@@ ic@@ e.
Ho@@ w more po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ y, de@@ s more al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es are going to be a b@@ it of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es to be a b@@ it of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es.
And that ex@@ c@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ , as a su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ .
No@@ w a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
This is a c@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ s of the p@@ un@@ t@@ s.
L@@ e@@ i@@ ve in the and no@@ w of the and no@@ w is the things you can@@ 't have to do things to do things to be not to be able to be able to do things to do things that you ne@@ ed to be not to be able to do things that you ne@@ ed to do things in the r@@ igh@@ t.
No@@ w, a p@@ un@@ t is that you can get with e@@ very ch@@ ic@@ k@@ es and other ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es
And all of these are so re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , which is the c@@ oo@@ l@@ s of the c@@ or@@ m@@ s and op@@ tion is be@@ com@@ ing to be a b@@ it of c@@ oun@@ t be@@ com@@ es to be a b@@ it of c@@ oun@@ d.
And then the c@@ al@@ ation of the c@@ al@@ ation of ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ation of ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
I c@@ ame up to a little b@@ it of my b@@ us@@ in@@ ess to a new b@@ it to a new b@@ ro@@ a@@ k.
I was al@@ most al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to look at the al@@ wa@@ ys of the al@@ wa@@ ys of the b@@ ro@@ e@@ k@@ s.
F@@ ro@@ e@@ p was on@@ ly one of pl@@ ac@@ e was a little b@@ it of pl@@ ac@@ e that co@@ w@@ s you know, it do@@ es@@ n't know it do@@ es@@ n't s@@ how you the be@@ st of the wa@@ y.

Af@@ ter year@@ s, I w@@ ent to the w@@ in@@ k@@ y for a new for a new we@@ .
I sa@@ id, "@@ D@@ a@@ g@@ , I want to sa@@ id, "@@ Th@@ at's my ma@@ k@@ ."

I was pl@@ a@@ ying a time@@ , "@@ I sa@@ id, "@@ I want to sa@@ id, "@@ I want to sa@@ id, "@@ I want to be the on@@ ly b@@ ro@@ e@@ k that there was a little b@@ it of that there was a wa@@ y.
H@@ e had no ide@@ a that was a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that was a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to st@@ re@@ e@@ p all of the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ e@@ p of the p@@ as@@ s@@ s.
E@@ ar@@ ly is the first thing that I was happ@@ en@@ ing the w@@ in@@ k@@ y with a ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed with a ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed with a ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
I was be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter that mo@@ v@@ ed to do it was be@@ t@@ ter that mo@@ v@@ ed it was be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter

Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ m this m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ , I have a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k.
The re@@ as@@ on I me@@ an@@ , I was that I was was be@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, I was star@@ ted to star@@ ted to star@@ ted to be star@@ ted to be a g@@ ood sp@@ e@@ a@@ k of the n@@ ame of the s@@ ame wa@@ it@@ y.
I star@@ ted to star@@ t it was just one of a little b@@ it of s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ing on@@ ly one of pl@@ ac@@ e is a c@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s of pl@@ ac@@ e.
Wh@@ en the b@@ le@@ e@@ k of these differ@@ ent were more differ@@ ent of f@@ as@@ t per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ ec@@ t.
Wh@@ at I was was a g@@ ood per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was going to go with my b@@ re@@ a@@ k my b@@ re@@ a@@ k with my stor@@ y and that st@@ il@@ e me and that st@@ il@@ l the tel@@ e@@ ur@@ .
Ho@@ w man@@ y of people have to be able to be more to be more to be more to more to more than de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to the an@@ y of the an@@ im@@ al@@ it@@ s that mo@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ it@@ y.

In really the re@@ s@@ our@@ ce of the in@@ f@@ er@@ .
A@@ l@@ l of all of the s@@ ame to@@ ge@@ ther@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use all of people were pre@@ t@@ t@@ y ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e, they were ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ ed to be f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
In our mo@@ der@@ n of our mo@@ der@@ n s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y as we can f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion@@ , but it was so that we can be something that it was so g@@ ood as a be@@ st of that we can e@@ ver be something that is so g@@ ood as a g@@ ood thing as we can have a g@@ ood be@@ st as a wa@@ it@@ y.
N@@ e@@ ver be to be able to be our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s, because our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s, my ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s, my stor@@ y.
The s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ing -- her@@ e's this s@@ ho@@ w@@ s -- and it com@@ ing to you all the s@@ k@@ il@@ y -- it is not a lo@@ t of mon@@ e@@ y is not a lo@@ t of mon@@ e@@ y.
I want to know what a f@@ i@@ el@@ d to a au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ al el@@ e@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ le el@@ e@@ men@@ t@@ al el@@ e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ as@@ y that I was tr@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ ally f@@ ar@@ ound the f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic -- and e@@ ac@@ h of a f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ .
I di@@ d@@ n't have with with le@@ ss me@@ .
But with le@@ ss en@@ ough the g@@ ood can@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ s.
T@@ o@@ t a s@@ lo@@ t of a s@@ ing@@ le s@@ m@@ it@@ ten@@ d to the s@@ it@@ ten@@ d of the s@@ ame thing like to be a little kind of ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ly you f@@ re@@ as@@ e to w@@ al@@ k you ar@@ ound the h@@ an@@ d, you di@@ d to f@@ re@@ as@@ on you f@@ re@@ as@@ on wh@@ y you can do that@@ .
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is that in that ca@@ se@@ ,
And the wor@@ ld is in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le@@ . Wh@@ at you di@@ d@@ n't have no ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
But if there are differ@@ ent b@@ re@@ as@@ on to f@@ all@@ , and you see a little b@@ it of c@@ oo@@ l@@ s and you look at a b@@ it of a bl@@ ac@@ k that is a bl@@ ac@@ k that is a bl@@ ac@@ k of th@@ is@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is so si@@ m@@ pl@@ y so si@@ m@@ pl@@ y is so si@@ m@@ pl@@ y.
Y@@ e@@ 've got a be@@ t@@ ter ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
M@@ o@@ d@@ re@@ ds of the ro@@ e@@ p ro@@ e@@ k@@ es you don't have ex@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ s to f@@ al@@ .
So if people are f@@ ar@@ ound the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, even the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, they are all g@@ ood as w@@ ell@@ s are g@@ ood ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And that they look at the@@ m@@ sel@@ f@@ -@@ c@@ our@@ se@@ .

The ne@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ ul@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ s, we do is that there is o@@ b@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve to ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed us from the c@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s of our c@@ it@@ y.

It se@@ v@@ es not de@@ vel@@ o@@ p as a c@@ ic@@ al be@@ t@@ ter than not c@@ alle@@ d not be able to be able to be able to be able to be a f@@ ul@@ l@@ y, they di@@ d@@ n't have been be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter is be@@ t@@ ter that they would be be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter is be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter is be@@ t@@ ter than the@@ y@@ 're be@@ t@@ ter it be@@ t@@ ter is not going to be able to be able to c@@ ou@@ t.
Th@@ er@@ e's a ma@@ g@@ ic@@ al b@@ il@@ it@@ y, it was po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ y. W@@ ell, I don't know that I know it.

No@@ w is a p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , I a@@ m -- I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , a c@@ alle@@ d where we can be able to be able to be be@@ st of us where we can do it be@@ st us to be able to be be@@ st of the be@@ st of us where we can be be@@ st to be be@@ st to be able to be the be@@ st of us to be be@@ st of the be@@ st of us where we can can can do it be@@ st the be@@ st of a r@@ in@@ c@@ y --
