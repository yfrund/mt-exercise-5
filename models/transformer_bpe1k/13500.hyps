Fore year, I showed these two dia's showing the pollow of the police of the last three million years of the size of the size of the vastanced of the U.S. with 40 percent croms.
But this is actually actually the excited of this particular problem because it doesn't the dictor.
The ice cape on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crite in the summmits in the summmal.
The next dia that I showed is a version of what happened is the last 25 years.
The permanence is clearning in room.
As you see, it looks at dark from dark blue.
That's the year, the year, of the winter.
And the cricks, in the summiter.
The same permanent of ice, five years or older, five years or parently like blood as blood is almost like this.
In 25 years, the way of this is going to this this.
And that's a problem because the frors around the North partment was the North partment and there's a very big amount of a very big amount of course is a very great amount of the designs is designing through microbes in methan.
And, with the total high-fielity in the atmosphere, that would be except to the atmosphere, if we can do it up.
In some undipe of the water in Alaska borrely of the water.
And, Professor Katey Walter of the University of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another undiep me.
Whoo! Well, OK. The question is real real or we will be love.
A reason that is that this huge "warming warming Groenl, Groenls from the north of opwarming.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than ever greater than ever bigger than ever figure out than ever full is full than ever greater than ever greater than ever bigger than ever figure out of the water than ever free.
This is the Kangerlusual again, right-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea of how the sea of country because it country to me, this is the place where it comes in the sea coming in the sea coming coming in the sea of coming in the sea country.
These stroms take flight of flight of flights.
An the other side of the planet, on the South policy find the greatest ice mass the greatest ice mass of the Earth.
And, scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative imagative imagative icnegative icnegative ice.
More specifical is the ice of the South polled the South polled to the smeltype of the smeltyple of water ished to the same this.
The whole continent stating meters for six meter, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after greatest ice of the ice of years, there are new noticed new notice of years ago, who were now a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population population is the half of the smell time.
In the Andes, this glass is the source of drager for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappearing the drowing water.
In California was a further in the snow of 40 percent in snow.
It comes in the water reseries of the water reservoires.
And as you could reading the predictions are the predictions of it.
This world, this world's dreamed to a dramatical stycle of fires fires of fires.
And the number of natural crams around the world, with an incredible and never seen unbelieved with an incredible speeed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unpresent increating it.
If you look at the point of a historical context than you see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton of CO2 h.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Kyans, well-went to the eye of the Stille Ocean, from America, west, from America, west, and every single of the Indian extree of the Indian exction of the ocean.
The only big cause of the Earth, nawarming of the Earth, which is the burning of fossil fuel, is the burning of fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem of this, and currently the size problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extincluding with China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more more citions.
But we see a member.
These are the countrales that the building was annuled annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives were broading in the long alternatives were proposed in the last of the building of the building of the last years.
There's a political stribute in our country.
The cities of coal, and oil-industree gave year, 250 million dollars to promotly a single of course currently cool is a generous capacity.
And that picture to think about something like this.
Rond the charter was in Tennesse, at me in Tennesse, four billion liter billion liter model.
You have the probably in the news of the news of it.
This is the one after of one after fired in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction of the LHC at TED.
And I reward back with a hope with a hope about how that machine works.
So I am doesn't have the one of those who were not the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment experiment in the understanding experiment in the ometer.
It need to be the heard naboots that were present less than a billion than a billion dously started to 600 million times a second of 600 million times a seconds.
Enorm ambition!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Bangs inside detectors of the detectors that I work. It is the ATLAS. It was the ATLAS.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
On 10 september shape of the first time, we put the machine for the first time.
This photographed by ATLAS.
And that was a party for a party party camery.
It's a picture of the first particle particle of the first particle of the LHC g, and with operating the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with the piece of the LHC, which is particle.
By other words, when we saw that picture that picture to 10 September we've got the machine works, which is a huge considered considered in the machine.
I don't know if this is the greatest of the greatest of this, or then, or this, if somebody to Google and saw that the internetpage and saw that the internetpage of this,
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact as a scientific impact of a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these gold to make these gold behavior.
That drawing 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers are saying, "No true. It's too little bit of small of your drawing."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superated on all the temperature temperature of the temperature of them are doing because they can be superate.
So on miles fired than the space between the girls, that can read that draws that are reading reason that are represented between the global between the glass of the glack between the glass between between between the global between the girls between the global between between the space between between between between between the girls.
In one of the connection between nets thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And that was a wire thing was warming out of the same electrical wearound 13 thousand ample of amper resources of amper resources of ample of the same thousand ample of the same thousand ample of the same three of the became a thousand ample of the same thousand ample of them were increating that was a lot of electrical readvanced thousand clear.
This was the result.
This is another inpressive, if you realized that that magnets more than 20 ton weagnets more than 20 centimeter than 20 centimeter in the same timeter than 30 centimeter in the timeter of the same three of three centimeter that that magnets are more than 20 centimeter that that magnets are more than 20 ton the inpresent of the realization.
We protected about 50 magnets.
We had to half them out of it.
We all have them all the time.
Now they're back on the way.
Eind the LHC weather intact the LHC weather.
We will expect it again, and we expected to measure in juni or youry to the except of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, who have incredibate the debate of scientific research of scientific research. It's easy research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard that we are going to be further than ever going to be the LHC.

I would start to questions, I would go back to your kids to your kids play with blocks.
When you discovered how to understand how to understand how to move and consciously problems of the learn solving solving the country to depended with the corporal relationships.
Rum insight is strongly insent of the world to understand the world to understand us.
If a information of information with the name of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advision with my advisual interested with my advisithi -- what we would have to ask to ask -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use -- what we would use a computer, in place, in a place of information with a fingerty fingertly, we can informed in a place with a place with a fingle fivation with a fairing inforward to inforward to fective fular fingerred to the red to the fular red of fular re.
And can we orders like we want to lea?
This question of us so decided that we decided to look for answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort a single of a Sifty interactive computer size of a cookooks.
They can be continue with the hand they can feel each other, their movement and they live detect a screen and decided and contact.
The certainly understanding is the physical handely of blocks like blocks to understand until of understand unning it to understand it.
For the venue of a new ecosystem of ecosystem for manipulate a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
That this bottoward a more physical different of their movement and their movement and even of their movement and even of the way we moved them to move, and even of the way we move, there are different new and like interactions of leake and like interactions of the way we like interactions of the movement and like of them to discovered them to discovered them to discovered them to discovered them to didiscovered them to discovered them to discover the way we have to discoverevirtual different of the way we are move.
I started with some simple example.
This Sifty is instifty to tell a video to soil, and others and others and others and others and othersing others and others play.
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indis next each other, they will interests for each other.
If they are going to be remarkable, they can also be a couldn't be a choice.
For feeling them feeling and hell.
We realized algave that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interesting interesting of these interesting interesting is the usual bars of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of fly.
In this example, three Siftables of the examples of the example, and I can use them to go into a leg gling them to go into a leg glassing global Siftables of the example.
If we have review of the good returns we go back to it.
There are some cappe possibilities for education, forward education, mathematics and logics and logics that we want to give people to probability to probably things to probably the result of the education and see the result of the education.
Here I show -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci of a simple resulty programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmation.
Here we show here is a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a textable, and feeling the corportunately words are controlled in a words.
After about 30 seconds is the conditued and different shapes a new series of letters with break-in-opportunity.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am in and there's a video of it.
They were actually actually really, it was really away.
And one of the most interesting things of these most interesting is that people almost not almost people almost not almost instructions needed not instructions of the most interesting things of these most interesting is that people need almost interesting things of these most interesting is that people need almost not almost interesting things that are almost not almost interesting instructions of the most interesting things that need is almost not need to
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and exactly what they need to do is doing what they need to do is what they need to do is "Moh word."
Here are some other people on the test.
That's our jught bat, righta tester, right?
But, he seems that he did the Siftables of the Siftables of the Siftables of the Siftables of the Siftables that he did the Siftables that he did the Siftables that he did the Siftables that he did the Siftable.
For him was just blocks.
Here is a interactive paintingly show.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonster dies.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftill brings, by the table.
Here it is the sun coming the sun coming up here.
Video: The sun coming up.
David Merrill: No you have a tract of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of Merrill: No you have a tract of the scene of the scened.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good day! Yeah! Yeah!
By the shape of Siftables and the name places of the caracross of the capable to respond to each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a open ende.
and he decided how it decided to decision.
Video: The cat flying road.
DM: The last example example, I will show Is a synthesizer and live music and live music, where we have developed to developed a sound, as the sound, like the lead, bass and drum.
Eengineering four different variations that you can use choose what you want to use it.
These happy in life can be increated in Siftables so that you can depick the pattern itself.
You place a sound in pattern by the pattern of a leg Siftility of controlling controlling effects like reverble effects and filter.
They're going to sound and sounded by can.
And, the algemenal effects like tempo and completely pattern of the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftill lead.
Now, I place the basline of the bases.
Video: No foot I feed what slaggwork
Video: And now I can copple the filter of the filter of the effect of the effect of live influence.
Video: I can celling it very distribute by the obvious of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: No copple I was the filter for what expression.
Video: I can repearing the patterer repearing the play.
So I don't have to planning all of planning, but I can improvisers, the very longer and corter and corter corter and corter corter and corter corter and corter corter and so longer and so longer and so longer and so forward to plann.
With the dimmmmessages of the volum Sifty Siftelling to the link of the left Siftell.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of new people, I look at the new people, computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces our brains and work our brains and work our brains works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of element with some possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the core is just a very new generation is a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information with digital media, which we want.
I dank you very much.
I look at this with you all of you to talk to you all with you now.
I'm writing it.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My life life for a long long and I don't think that ever will change and I don't think that ever will change that ever change to change that ever change to change and I don't think that ever will change and I don't think that ever change to change and I don't think that ever will change and I don't think that ever change to change and I don't think that ever change to change and I don't think that e
And there is unless of a little bit of a little bit in my life and career and career and career with my work with my work and career and showing my work and career is a this.
It started with a book that I was written written a memoving, "Eten, Bem, Bem, Bembiness to my first first first work to my first work work and a international exciting and a international excited and international excited and international excited with a book, and international excited with a book, and the inter
The result is that people now have to do all and always to always do.
Well, what -- you do do -- thought --
People come to me and ask to me and question: "Ben you don't you do this succcess?
If you won't you live to be able to write life write write of the book, publish where people will be making for warm to be able to be able to be able to be the heavail?
If you don't have a bang present?"
And, you know, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much for 20 years ago, I was remember 20 years ago, when I was a teener -- if I told I was writing that I wanted to be a teenad.
People said, "Ben you don't you never get succcess?
Don't you get not bang for education, that you really?
Ben you don't you do that you live to this work without that there is ever comes without that there is something that you get something that you are going to be able to the public of your bitters of your bitters of falen?"
Something in that strekkking.
In the short comes my answer to this question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are called
Always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always alway.
But I also am for a lot of other things that all of angling for all of it.
For example, and other entire things, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing to write myself the last time that the angives from.
Is it rational?
Is it ways becomes to be bang that is being to be able to be the work for the work for the work of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the work for the work that they are showing to their human being to the work that is what do they work to their human being to be able to be able to be able to be the work
What is so full that we creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the ministic, something that is not happened to work about the other kind of work work is not happening to happens.
Now, you know, he was my father. He was skill engineer, and I can't remember that there was a found that there was a questionly whether he was not any for it.
So this is how it to chemistry with chemistry blockade?"
Now, this was not about it.
And to be fairly to be fairly engineers have been hold by the century of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists of manical alcoholists holists of malcoholists of manic.
Scheters of the reputation.
Not just write of the creative people have reputation human being human being instabout.
Look at the grimy doing the grimmight do under the most magnifical creative miny creative ministry creative mine.

And even the genes that don't have a self-moord funder their gave corporator.
In the last interview for his dead, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's what to say is what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of except we don't look at it.
We all have heard the all of the earlier and have been accepted with the sources of accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is creativity understanding is increativity with lish and that a artists will lead to existing artists to call of the extence.
And so I want to talk to everybody here today with that idea of life of life?
Do you do that?
Because I think about that, I think about it all all of the way I think about not enough pretty though.
I think of the weather ful.
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't see this century this century.
We can creative mind a lot of better to live better of life.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for the dark of those dark for those dark for me.
Seach the fase where my careers now is now invented to now
Ga but after young, I'm still young, amper settly.
I can perhaps another four decade.
Hoogling everything I'll seen another published by the outside world as the work that following that extraordinary succcessful.
We are with friends with friends each other, so I can full you required my grandest successary of beyond me.
Jemig, what a idea of idea!
If you think about that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the morning for the desive in the bottowar.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work of it.
The question is, "Do Do "Do wish?"
Now, after long after I think I can just come to the conclusion if I can just go with write a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding.
I have to create a securrent descrips between me, and my controlling myself and my government for the response for the reactions for the reactions of my futures.
I have the last year, I did to way.
I am in the history and have done in other ship in other showing in other showing or others have found to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help creative percent complicative process.
My search was brains me burning the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let me sop, because it's a long and increated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins and believed that creativity was not creativity of itself.
Men believy that creativity was a good partly required of a results, unknowledge to the human reasons.
The Greeks now call these necessary of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demp words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of same idea.
And they were called them a called creative spirit was a genious creative mine.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genion of a genious person touch.
In their production was a genion was a genial godable, in the mure of the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work was working on the genious assistance.
Anyway, he gave form to work on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise that I had the first first first time I had the first one earlier protection of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work ging.
The articles was so in protection of protection was so much narcisme.
If you work work for a brease, you didn't all the equar.
Everybody knew that was a unvisible genious genious genious genious genious genious genious of the unvisible of that.
Well, you know, you work reflected that doesn't just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a predicted genious genious genious genious genious genious genious geniously geniously genius.
Lange time is that was the Westen creativity was creativity was protected to protected the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was that in the Westen creativity was protected how in the Westen creativity was was that was been protected to the Wests creativity.
When was the Renaissance, and everything change.
There is a very new idea of idea of new idea: the individual humans is the middle of the universe and mysterious and mysteriles.
No space for mystical creatures from the godness of the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believy that creativity was completely from the individual came of individual
And for the first time in history was in history was a genious said that they had a genius were not a genius and not that they had a genious and not that she had a genius had a genius had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I have a big full follow.
And to believe one person, one person, one of a single individual is the fix, the essentially is the essentially the bron mystery of the century mystery of the century mystery of the century of the fragion a fragiality for a fragiality for a frager human psych.
Anybody question in sky.
Egos are blowing to gigantic proporties and there are unimaginable.
And I think this pressures the last 500 years of artists of artists has made a lot of artists of the last 500 years of artists of the last 500 years of artists of artists of artists of the last 500 years of artists of artists that this does have made a lot of artists of artists a lot of artists that this
If that is, and I think that is so I think about that, "What now?
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on a older understand the creative mystery of the relationship mystery of the relations?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years of rational house in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the real real legling of the real hour.
Well, probably sit in the audience people who have ready scientific deside of the idea that equives of the idea that equal science of the work of artists of artists to inspire inspirit of the work of artists of the work of artists that have been leavel in the audience.
It doesn't seem to get you all of you get all of that.
And I ask it question I walk me to it.
Why not?
Why would we not have that thought to not point to next that thought?
The fast, as much as much as any other dissions of the total maframes that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have trying to create something has trying to create -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process -- knows not always the creative process is not always the creative process --
That sometimes almost paranormal.
I have an unless the great American disince Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone of the mal American disine.
She's dicular in the next of the next of writing them.
She told me about her jeught on the platattell Virginia.
Sometime, if she was work on the work was a close she'd have a close close of country.
It was so said -- it was so said if there was a big golf flight of lives.
Some close of golf country to her it.
She felt that the ground under her foot under her foot and knew that her foot on that point to do that, but one thing to do is to do that.
She was going to she home, and she had to show to show it possible and paper and paper and paper and packing.
When it was close by her her her was shot that her was that her office to write it on the sky.
Sometimes she didn't fast enough.
Then ring and running and running the house is not.
And in the moments school the close of shape of the fired of the many of the fired -- in her words -- to another directly -- to another directs.
And also there were a little bit -- this find I think the best part of the story of the story -- that they did the beautifull -- that they almost mistake.
And then she was in looking for a search and paper and paper and prided by her heave.
Juist on that moment had a potoment had a potter of picks.
And with her other hand, so told me she was close to the close of the air.
She picked up in his start, and put it back in her body in her body in her body ey's scribe.
In those close came out of the close that in sources in a lot of paper and piece of paper order to following following following following in the case of close.
When I heard that heard -- what I was expectly -- I thought my creative process!
So my creative process not! I'm not a medium dium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium medium! I'm not a medium diume! I'm not a medium diume! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, who are a mile, who was the same time, and then cross and with blood and with blood and trans with blood and trans down to be a bridge and then them.
But even in that day search sewood I have a experience of experience.
You know, you will also full knowledge that there are creative ideas that creative ideas in your bron that you can imagine impossible you can identify and identify and you can identify faidentify --
What is that sources?
How can we use it without that we are being without that we are being through that?
One way that are good for us?
The best contemporaine example, I can think I can think is musicians mmusician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time,
We had the this.
And in fact, in fact, a great part of his life of his life was showed of the current of the current artists that are trying to get all the power of the unbety creatives that are creative impulse in him in him in him in him in him of the show.
With the 1990s was a singer.
At a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of radical radical forc.
And as he did there was so reading a fragmental of a melodi.
The decided him, like inspiration that we've fairl, understand clear, understand clear.
It was a beautiful elowho wanted to fasth.
But not that it didn't do that.
He had no paper type, no paper order to see though.
The great exciting familiar again, "I rereally, I required the melowho is the melowho is full me to do the melowho are following back to the century of the familiar familired to the melowho c
I don't am enough, I can't do it.
He well, not real real real process and did that whole human process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry heard not the stuff I behind the stuff of the sk?"
"Do you really know that I can show a song you can crown?
If you really want to get this song you have to later later you have to couldn't have a time.
Now, not, not, somebody else did fall.
Ga neighbores at Leonard Cohen." And from the way that the process of the process of the process of different.
The work is still the same thing, with the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the same thing.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him reflected to distanced to distance.
It was a close to close the skin and living along and liverss.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through it.
It also was a wonderful work of conversation between conversation between Tom and the own aspect that not entire embract that not entire all of Tom itself was not entire currently called a wonder.
That story has changed my way of work change.
I had a profired of the secrat.
I was in writing in writing Ets, Biddle.
One a given moment in wants to hope.
You know, you want to be work to work and you don't think it a different displace and you think it is a different bad book.
Not side of bad bad bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of the bad of the bad of bad --
I wanted to do it all the project of all the project of all of the project of this.
When I remembered Tom that are enjoy to his genion who are genious to be a power to way.
I wish me from my manuscript and I was a leg amount of my hamer.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know all of this book is not just through this book, you know, it's not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop what I have.
More can't give it.
If you find that it can, you have to do your mind you you.
Stack? Do you don't have that.
I just write of this, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular away that are just telling that is just a bit today is just a difference."
Tja--- Unity, the questions, it comes on the neers.
Euws came out of the North African woostine African woost, people to dance to dance in the North African wish music.
Urs and hind to the ochtend of the ochtends.
That was always great, because the dances were completely professionals.
But sometime, there happened to be a real real thing.
One of those dances than transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you know, you also have seen you also have seen you in a performer.
It was like the time still put time and the dance of the stape.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of night, but now fair.
Plotation he doesn't leave longer only a human beings.
In hem, under him, under him, under him,
A good fired hours doing this.
If so did something happened, who's going to start Dan started to class and in class and in class: "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice of historical factory of Moren Span, Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Span.
The question is real real regular being "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, other, other, other, other.
And that hear you have the day of the day still of fights and flamengodances.
If a artists in Spance something impossible or magically doing human: "Allah, other, other, other, all the full of the wonderful."
One quote, sic: a glimp of God.
Precive, what we need now.
Lastil is real real that the dance morning to the next morning was discovered that he discovered that he didn't have a good ladning more it.
Because it's a little bit of a little bit of parenty with past, never that maybe never going to come to be going to come to them.
Maybe never going to be more anybody else to be more anybody where.
What do it with the rest of his liv?
That's hard.
That's hard to controlling for a creative mine.
But so pinside.
If you don't get all of the extraordinary aspects of your own.
If you believes you believe that you have a time to let a whiled of a not true specificate brout.
When you do do you get there.
So the sky, you can.
I hands of influence.
The last months I worked on a book that book that book that book is going to be different to long reikhalf to long reikhalf to is except to is except that is a book that is going to be a book that is going to be a book that is going to be a book that is going to be a book that iness is inside of a book that is going to be a book that iness is going to
The operatory of those illuster progreser progress.
If my thought with me to the hold of the hold of the same for: We're not band. Sup.
That just the work.
Like you doing doing that, which is also it is.
If it's a dance, thank you very dance.
If the godate genious genious engineering in your work on one of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful of the wonder."
Now, dance that not, thance than that.
And also this: "OK."
I believe that hear.
"Ol! Oll, how than ever we put from pure human loved and own own to remains place.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can meaning and what that can meaning of new sets of genes.
We started to go from a new point: we were actually trying to go and now the digital code of digital codes and now we try to go from that digital code to a new fase in biology and synthetic designing and synthetic of life.
So we tried to ask to ask the big questions.
"What is something that I think that is something that I think that have tried to understand understand on different levels in different level.
We tried to have different benaded the back to minimal components.
We are almost 20 years of the digitalizing of digitalization.
When we have sequency have sequenced, it was from the analog world of the analog world of the biology world of the computer.
Now we try to ask to question: we can regenerate new life creating life, from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of digital universe of this digital universe to regenerate new life creating life, or can we create new life to live to question: we can make new life regenerate?
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of organism, with the laboratorious in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at or we can get a nice smaller genome can come to a smaller genome.
We can put in the order of hundred of the 500 or so that are there in the order of the 500 or so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is relative simple relative to the unclear.
Now, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can look at the living cells that this is a living cell celly celly that this would be a living cell.
We decided that the only route presents was to stral this chromospited synthetic synthetic so that we could couldn't have the components to the components to strong the most fundamental questions to state the company questions of the most fundamental questions that we could couldn't refert the only de
And so we started with questions als: "Can we started a chromosphere?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry moleculate molecules, that we have never seen before we have never seen before we have never seen before we have never seen before the chemistry moleculate molecules.
And, if we do that, if we can start a chromospit?
A chromosphere, but a piece of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of digitalizing life is expected on exponential whose exponential whose
Our power to write the genetic coded to write the genetic code.
And our last point would it on this point would places on an exponential curve.
We are started here more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical depended to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard.
There are thousands of machines in the world, who small pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more folity.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Information of the genome Phi Somi 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the old of the oltcorrection.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began to piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria code of course, and viral particles and virtual.
The viral particles were solutely cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and dead, the E. coli. coli. coli. coli.
I was inded in the oil, and I said that they were said that she said that she said that she said that they were fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation is a situation where the software o-heard ware own heard in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much great.
We wanted to build the completely bacterial chromospite.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettts, so that we could build the cassettts, so we could figure the cassettle.
And to go to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information and starts with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accurazy accurazy information in computer.
When we first first first of the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a 10,000 baseparats.
And then we found after we found after 30 folts. If we had the original sequence of the original sequence of the didn't have been used to star.
And, design is the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to controlling with 50 letters of the other pieces of the other pieces that we need to build designing so that they can design so that they can design together to build design together to build design the design of the design is to build that they can design the
We design unique unique of this.
Maybe you read that we have water water right notice that we are stopping water right.
Beous: we have a fourth genetic code: A, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters coders for ruwwe've got 20 aminoses -- that there is a simply clearning for each aminose.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words.
And, of course we just couldn't just might be a mirth of the other.
Some were cally, called that there were no poems were directs.
We have this pieces that we can design them with enzyms.
There are enzymming and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the five with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long time, passing the five and you pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 7,000 letters of the five and you sets --
In every city city city of these pieces of these pieces of these pieces of these pieces because we want to create a process that is going to create a process -- that will be very roak -- that will be strain.
We try to try to reach automatising.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketbal.
And as we get toward of the great stuck -- more than 10,000 baseparate -- then they don't grow easy more in E. coli.
And that is the expectly the expensive of modern the modern of molecular biology.
And so we went to rade with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe of homologe recombinative, by the biology to reparticular DNA A to reparticular together to reparticipating together.
Here is a example of this.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radio radiodurans that three million radiation to can.
And that you see in the bottop of the top panel, six chromospite of each other.
12 hours later later later it was the weather, precise like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms.
These organisms can completely operated up.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can live in space that can existing in space that can example, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has show that there is a lot of that there, there's a lot of there.
Here's a real referty work of the moleculecule that we have made with these processes -- factory with these processes with the right design of the course of the pieces where we did them in the design of the cape of the pieces that we did them in the design of the moleculecule of the molecule.
Got makes that they carcarcarry together than that.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a commicroscope.
It's such a big microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we were inded until we did unless we did unle.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest moleculecule of people, with humans, with a clear structure.
The moleculecules is more than 300 million of it.
If we would pressive the crue of the points of punts letter, without of spations, there's 142 pages needed to pressive the genetic code of pression.
Good we started a chromosphere? How do we start it?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria bacterial this.
It's simpleer if you give you increate under eukaryots, like we just walk the cell of the cell of the cells and doing a different including that you know.
Well, the bacteria of chromosphered in the cell integrated in the cell, but we show we show we show we show a completely transplace of a chromossive to a other, and it can active.
We have a chromosphered of a chromospeed of a microbss.
These are about so far as far of each other.
We figure out what extra genes that we could figure out of this chromospited to select selects.
We have the did with enzyms to make all the egs of the egs of the egs of the egs.
It was fresational when we can put this in the cell of cells -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images here can value -- the new chromossive in the cell.
We even thought he was just to develop it but we tried to develop the process of developing developed to develop the process of developing process to develop the process of developing that he was just tried to develop that but we tried to develop the process of developing that it would be tried to develop thought it to develop thought it it but to developed to develop thought it it but to develop the process it was going to develop thought it out of the process it to developing to developing process to
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosside chromosphere, or a third of third or a third of thousands of own shows in one times of the species.
People who have been evolution to propossible as if one of the same thing that have change much biology community.
There are enzymms that are restriction to be enough, who actually actually take DNA reading DNA reading realize represent encouly.
The chromosphere, in the cell has not equal.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stop -- well, well.
It was expressive, and the referred to the other chromospeed material, and it operator, and it operately the new chromospling chromosphere, and the new chromossive the new chromospeed to the new chromosphere.
He was blue of the genes we had stop.
And in very short time in a very short time of the softwo-sof-so-soil, and changed completely in the new kind of software in the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software in the cell.
All the ways change changes the membrans -- when we change the genetic coded -- when we had the genetic coded was the precise that was changed.
This is a major clinks like genomical alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things
Now, I have been before before this is not a single of the sker -- this is pretborn -- this is prety evolution, and I have been a new version of the Cambring that we may have a new version of the Cambrice of the Cambrice of the Camble of the Cambran explosion of this digital design on this digital design on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's clearly clear if you look at what you need to look at what it is.
We are going to be inside of six-half to 9-half to 99 billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context place, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
every of us who are in 194, in 1940 years, that there will be four four this.
We have to have to have food with food, with the food, with the same food, burstance, burn for the six-half billion of billion billion of billion of water,
That's going to do that.
We use five billion ton coals, more than 30 billion fives oil.
That's 100 milos fix day.
When we have biological processes in ogenclear process than to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, of course, of course, the stor that is coming in the atmosphere.
By our world's discovered to have a database with about 20 million gentle, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozero had a dozeros and look at the diversity that is coming out there's coming out there.
We are presently limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now technology is thank you quick together to do called combinations of the combinations of the combinative.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of the resource of 20 million different genes or trying to make octanify processes to make octanify or medicine, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change a little bit more molecular than we can do with a little bit more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select selectance, chemical or fired or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screading imagine of what real designing work on where we work on the computer that we can actually go to the months and design a new species of design.
We don't know how it will see the way from the way to see it.
We know how their genetic code of how their genetic code.
We now are now on fourth generation is now fourth fuel of fourth fuel of fourth fuel of fourth fuel --
One longs have seen you to ethanol experiment.
We have second generation and third generation will come increate inside the inside of the comes like sugar, as sugar, as a sker fuel or different species like the different species of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have flow without the food price without and making the food price is to make the food, and we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start design to design that we can see the first food, and we think we are the first fourselves in the first square.
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwith, we have all sort of the world, we have all sort of other method.
This is a organism that we have described in 196.
It lives in the deep sea half miles of miles ep diep diep skilometers of the deep of the deep sea five miles of course.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecular water as energy source.
We are looking at the foot or we can take CO2 to funning fired to flect fabrise to fabrise to fabrise back to bring this process to bring this process.
So in a short time we think we are in a short of basic question the basal question the basal question: What's liv?"
We actually have realized the purpose of the purchemical industry industry industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do this,
A important energy source becoming source becomes
But we work now also using these works, of these works, for fastly series of thinking fast.
This year was the griep, we always just a bit behind the facts of the feits of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change can change by teforward vaccinated vaccine.
Here you see how the future, you can see the future, the evolutional boom now is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually
We are still follow from humans.
Our goal is a concerned that we make a chance to survival enough, to do that great enough to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to show to Microsoft to Microsoft is about a year. This is Seedraging. This is Seedrag. This is Seedrag.
And it's a environment where you can work with immense in the distance of fielhed visual data can work with immense work with immense work.
We look at this many gigabyts, and can name up with digital images and clears in -- and extension and except the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of the wish.
And it doesn't make how much information we look at how much these collections or images are different or images are different picture.
Most of his normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library or Congress, and then in the 300 megapix.
It all nothing because it would not be a prestations for the only thing would move influence, on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen of the screen is in the screen of the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a precy of not-picture of noty.
This is the grauwe house by Dicks. Every collabor. Every collect of chap.
And to prove that it actually actually actually too, and not real, and not picture to show that this really is really text to show this is not a picture of picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't required it.
This is a realistic, example. This is a quartery of the Guardian.
Every great imagination is the beginning of a particular part.
This is what you really think it is the pleasure of a real paper of a real paper or caper or maybe a scaling medium medium is a scaling medium is a scale.
We also have done with the amount of these increase of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertist of higher resolution -- many howner than a normal advertal advertist -- and we extra extra normal resolution -- and we have extra normal resolution -- and we have extra normal resolution -- and we have extra net.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car seat.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can do that we can really do the limits of hands of hands of hands of the screen of them can do through the screen of them can do the screen of them can do the screen of them can do the screen of hands of the screen of hands of them can do the screen that we can do the screen of hands of them can do the screen
We hope that this is not pop-ups more means and other third flaure.
Of course, a country to the hand for the hand for a technology like this, I will spent a technology as this, I will spent a time to spend a lot of time, except that we can also much more field.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
the picture of the NASA A of the NASA .
Now, let's look at something different.
This is the way, this is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of Seadragon and the other is a very beautifull piece of Washing Snavely, promove and so on the University of Washington, promot of Washington, and Steve Seitz on U.Washington, and the other is on U.Washington U.Washingtl.
And Rick Sself Sself Research. A beautiful. A beautiful.
So this is a Web. It's made the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we see this, we see this, that we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the images of the images has meaning.
The computer-vision algorithms have been continuous brain, so that they are control, with the real space -- the Grasist -- the Grash Rockies -- where they're genomes -- where they're genome or pancy pancy of stability and all these things are country to be these things are space being space.
I don't know if if you want to show you another time, other time is the other time.
There are lots of space that are lots of space.
I want to like to be a Noah's heard of the Nah's sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth synth -- to deal with the summmicer -- to deal with the communicate of this technique of the environments on the environments on our website.
We had to loval with the advocate and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Deaame with imagination of Flickr. Notre Daigh in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the pickr.
And each of these orange chairly picture of this orance of model of this model of this model of this model of model.
So these are all Flickr pickr pickr pickr polluency of these way right.
And we can take on simple wish after simple of simple well.
Well, I had never thought I had never thought I ever work with Microsoft
It's conversation here is so designing here so excited here.
I believe you that this is a lot of type cameras are cameras of good mirroflex, and a big number of cameras, a big number of this,
I will try to find some picture images to find the image.
There are so much discovered by face faces and thought and this.
Anywhere there is a series of photographs -- here is a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Deaame also chaint of the program of the program of the program of the Notre of the program of the Notre of the Notre of the Notre of this is even a poster of the Notre of this is even a poster of the Notre of the Notre is even a poster of the Notre of the Notre Deasy is also that this is a poster of the New.
If we were foura fix in a physical picture of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of everyone -- from the entire collective heavail, the Earth -- and coperated the Earth -- and copy that everything to each other.
All these photographs are conferned with each other, and a lot of greater than the party.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth is the whole Earth of the whole Earth is the whole Earth of the arth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth of the Earth Earth Earth of the arth.
And this as a confive on Stephen Lawler's work of the U.S.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it uses use, and also the prepared growing of the preparts of people who are using the people who are using it.
Their own photographs of metaphor-data who are inferred somebody else inferred.
If somebody would like to climits and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Daist of the Notre Daist with all those data, and I can use it uses to the access of those space, which metaphing that metaphold of the cruble of the crue of course of cruissue of crack and creating a kind of crack and creating human social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social s
And of course, is the by-product him of a immental fired model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not just from the airrights, but also from the other photographs, but also from the collective and other passses is also from the collective ge.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to start that what your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are depicture to the world together to the world together to the world can put together?
BAA: Yeah. What this is really discovered it.
The creates creating your wish, hyperlinks between picture between image.
And the picture of the data in the imagination.
And that designed when you think about the equaling when you think about the equality of semantic information why about mantic information that many of these images are lots of these images.
When you look at the web search to imagine, and the text of the web page of the web, and the text of the web, and the text of what the imagination is a lot of information about what the imagination is going to pick on the picture on the web page of the picture.
What if now do that image is all your picture is all your picture is all your picture is all your picture to all your picture is all your picture is all your picture is now what if you picture that are now that are now image?

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some question I want to talk about some questionly, I have a book of a book of questions.
Maybe you see parally, paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explained what you say that you mistake.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
And to be precisele: the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma did like this, to get the amazing of our burgers on the highest levels on the highest levels to get them so many individual free as much individual free.
Free is a great good deed, a great part of the human exist.
Fedness is freedom to hands to own insent own inseen a higher wonderful shower in the higher of thing.
The ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more free in that people have more free.
And more free means automatically more of fire.
This is so did in our society that nobody would be during that nobody would be during for expensive to concern.
And also in our life is this dogma five fance.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A big.
Even about thressings.

Wellight you have this model in the winkly, but you can see a very certain of his ministry that happens in the winkly.
The advance: people come to the wink and stelling this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that don't do much to do much do.
And also in aspects of life that are lots of important than the same of spulling is this explosive towards of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of the spulture, is this expects of the spular of spular than the spular of spular than the same time.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. including -- it's in the U.S. including the doctor, and that you tell you what you need to do you tell you what you need to do to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do And, we can do it.
As this other, and after that.
And the obviously of these and do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do is flos?"
And the doctor, "As this oblives and true this objects, and true this object.
What do you want to do that?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was, what would you do was you doing doing that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you call of you don't am you."
And that call we call "own inbringing the patient of the patient of the patient."
That is very positive, but means in fact, but means in fact, the shape of decision of somebody with somebody with somebody -- the doctors -- to a leak, somebody who has secertainly disease and not the best concerning concerns -- the patient.
Good protect that ners that ners, because the doel, you can't buy and I can't buy them.
Why do we make it copen they can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctors to ask our doctors to ask that other markable.
Our identity, as a design n as a design of aspect of us is now controlling on this dia sincluding of choices, like you can see on this dia dia of aspect of aspect of aspect of us.
Our identity state our floces of our background.
We find ourselves -- so often often -- so often we just want.
Everybody need to be thinking for what you want to do is what for person you want to be thinking for person you want to be thinking for person you want to be thinking for person you want to be thinking for person you to think of what for person you want to do this.
Let's have the same this, the sky.
There's a time that freedom, everybody else that you know, you know, the fast as quickly from the possible as possible as possible of children started to children started to kids started to kids.
The only work was with wieve, not when and what you did and what you did do.
Now freedom, all for the opportunity.
I give you leave students, I so, that I designed less intelligent of less homework less than ear.
They don't she's not domber than in early time.
No, they have the pressive with choices.
"Well, I did if not? Well, I did now?
Or I will I go to children, or a care? Neam I first children, or a career re?"
These are all of these are all singing questions.
They are going to have a answer to have a answer to do answer home of their home work and therefore and therefore of that.
And they have the same questions.
And then we come to work with work. Carl gave already that technology is to work every day of every day of every day -- the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a single place, which I mean, where WiFi the do.
I don't fail, because I don't want to keep that I want to keep place for me.
But good choice choice choices of work in that we are still in that we are going to work on the time, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwish of our son the son the one of the sonce of the ene can, and our Blackberry on the other can, and our laptop on the other hand, and our laptop on school.
And even if they all excited with all minute everybody of that wedinner of those wedden question: "Well, I ask this phone is I say, "Well, I do this phone is answer?
So I writer? Stoo? Suilt I write this letter?
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience, we experience.
Well, where we look at the great, the great, the small, the small, life is life is a questions, life is a questions.
So the world there was early looking at the world there.
There were what choices, but not all the choice of choose was a quote.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is nowing this. Is this good or bad of bad or bad of bad or bad this.
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all about is, so there is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about bad about what is bad about it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two effects effects on the human effects on the human
A very free effect is that the first one-flamily free than completely free than defice.
Mown, people find the lasty of people find the lasty to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research for investments in front of investments in front planning in front of investments.
A collega of mine of me came access to investment of Vanguard, a great promised society with about 2,000 million works, a great society with about 2,000 feet of 2,000 feet of 2,000 seats.
They discovered that for every tirewards the works, the particular fundred the work-funclear two percent depended two percent depended two percent depended the works.
If fify fundress of the five percent less works, with five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five
Because it fify fundress of fundred to choose that people are just excited to the next da, and that people are just excited to the next da, and that drop, and so forth.
And of the still comes from the still comes from it.
That doesn't means that people after their pensionate not dream to eat the same time, because they don't have enough money because they have been couldn't mean they work as it was so lastil so she was working on the workly.
And that songling to 5,000 dollars a year, for the neus year.
The workabout, the workabout, their own own breakthouble.
So the free of choice can work in the free of choice.
And I think the world there is so from the world through this.
If it to the century of the century to you very love to the right choices, right?
You don't want to be opposed with the wrong fundress the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect effect is that we had the lost of our depended and choose eventually did to the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of our had less options and had had had had a less options than we had the last effect.
There's a reasons for that.
A is that there is that there was a choice, for example, for example, back to the choice can be conferned that the choice was not perfects.
You still you know, you give in a case of choice would be better to be better for that another choice.
This is dreamed alternative she's going to get that you get to choice of your choice.
And then does doing the following of the choice of choice that you have made a good choice way.
And the more options of the easy is to have the easier to have the unaverse of unaverse of unaverse of the cose of the cose of the cocoses.
Second reason with substitutional cost.
And then Gilbert of the morning of how often we depended the value of things we depended them to the value of the things we see.
If you can increate many alternatives can increate the attractives of all the alternatives of all the alternatives you can windo.
That makes you have less teating less with the alternative that you have cocose to have cose to have chose the alternative that you have chose to have leave.
A example. For the example. For the New Yorkers under you.
This is a little bit of the strekulling of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a dure second woning.
They are sit on a beautiful strange. Straling again. Go human shot.
Do can't be full right? "For dic." It's thinking man, "It's auginstance.
Everybody in my neighbort in Manhattan is the city of it.
I would have my car flack for the door."
And he was simply two weeks to simply two weeks that he was a great parking place a great parking place mission of the front of fired.
Substitutional cost of the following of the following of our choice we have a great choice choice choice of choice.
And the more possibilities are more requires alternative.
And that presents, as substitutional cost.
And, one example.
This picture story of the number of points.
Like in the here and now is now that you don't have to continuous things that you have to continue.
And, one point is that you can close with every choices.
And all that other has so his attracking cans, which is that the cocosh option less option less option less incredicately result.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I was came up with this stuff my search to a new brow.
I always always always speak always speed.
Freally, but one sort of speed, and that cows you know, and you did your dance. It doesn't incredibly uncomfortable, but if you dibly enough, but if you were doing the broke and food, the right?
And after years, I went to the wink for a new thing.
I said, "Dag, I want to a speeek, this is my makes my makes my makes my makes my me."
And the windoing said, "Wilt you fit, easy fit, easy fit or relaxed fit?
While you do to do you cral was? Whilt was you stone-was?
Do you have a browing with slude the top?
Wilt you expensive a little bit expensive pipal." And so he was so full pipipal.
I was speake, I was a little bit said, "I want to say, "I want to the only broek that there was early going to was."
He had no idea was that broek that was a long long all the possible broeks of the browing of the possible browing on the caps.
And, I set the wink of the wink of the wink with a extincluding passing brow.
I had better this. I had better thought I could do it better do.
But I don't feeling me better.
Why? Because this is to explain, I have a book of written wrote a book written this.
The reason I didn't feeling me feeling with all of those choice was that I started to expect the faster of a good speeed.
I started without with no expectation, because I just just one kind of speeed.
When it turned out that there were different and one of them would be a fix of the perfect.
What I was good food, but not perfect.
And so I was reading my browing my browing expects, and that stelebrating me me to me.
The more possibilities people have expectations of the distant of those possibilities of those possibilities.
And that means people less teach less tests with results, even if it good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I have this is now.
In the really is about it.
All was better when everything was bad of bad was bad of it.
Because when everything was bad people prety experienced experience.
In our modern society can be as a great society of citizens expected to expects, but the best thing we can reach is so good if we were expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expec
Now, we never reasons, because our expects, my expectations of expects, my expectance.
The secret of happiness -- this is what you are all of happiness -- the securrencouldn't expected a lot of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to state a carbon the ographically elemental -- that I am with a woman who actually fantastic.
I didn't have a her with less tested with less temportunate.
But with less enough necessar.
And finally, you know, When you do a bad bad of bad browing a bad browing as a one, but one one kind of a single of presentation, you can bent.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you can build a that turns out to fall that is a whose responsible who's responsibility?
The answer is just like simple. That's simple.
I had a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different browing you don't have except to fal.
So if people decisions, even if people decisions, they are close to be good food, they're classing about their choice.
And they remember, they remember quality.
In the western society soundation of the soundary of the juger generations of higher generations of higher generations of higher generations of the western of the western of the western of the western society of the western society of the western society of the western of the western of the wester
A factor -- not the enige, but a significance, but a significancy of depression of depression and self-moord, is that people have so often television of their high-experience.
And if they try to explaining themselves to explore themselves themselves.
So the netoresultate is that we objective in the profound of the bad of govern, but our bad us feel.
And, now a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is true for where becoming to down.
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't refletter that can choose better than not choose carry out of the carbon that is not carefully better more choice is better more choice is better.
There's a magical grounds, I don't know electributtility.
But I know that we are already for the point that choice is that choice is free us great degree of us great for the point of the point that we are already presents.
Now there's a principle, -- I'm almost almost almost of almost -- a principle.
The choice in industrialized countries from material countries from material government.
There are lots of places on the world, we have heard about before is not so much choice is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice.
So the paradox that I speak with name for the modernearly West.
That's frustrated and this is frustrated to do this, Steve Levitt you go to install and expended that dure and expensive and lon't help.
I say the same thing, increated choices -- they help -- they help not. Erger -- they didn't help it.
They make us live life lives less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices were contribute to countries where people have been going to have to do the life of those people in the way.
And also we live to present for it.
That's what economists is a Pareto-improving.
Everybody is better through resources -- not just poor people -- and that comes from the last of choice that we have to measure with us.
And finally, it was a little bit of this. If you read this picture, side, and say, "Ach, what knows say, "Ach, what know?
Nothing is possible in a sense of coming in a sense.
A writal imagination, a shortist world's picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I was going to start about this fish I started to better that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you reading the breakable to create possibility, but you have no freedom, but lost not freedom.
If you course the vision to create possibilities to create less teating less teating less to create possibilities to create possibilities to create possibilities to create the vision to create possibilities to create the abilities of the possibilities of
It leads to more disaple and less teving.
Everybody has a vision to critical to critical to crity.
This is freedom, this is free -- possible for the fish, but for us.
But the depency of a figures sense of a figure of fish, undred to infly.
Thank you for your attention.
