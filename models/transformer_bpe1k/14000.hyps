And I show you just show these two dia's to show that the past three million the past three million years of three million years of the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent croms of the United States,
But this experience is the required of this particular problem because it doesn't the dictor of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice capach on the North police is in a certain the copping of our global climate system.
It makes in the winter and crimps in the summer.
The next shows I shows is a version of what the past 25 years of what happened.
The permanency is clearning in rood.
As you see it from the dark of dark blued.
That's the year, the early side of the winter.
And it crack in the summer.
And the same thing that the permanence, or older, is almost like blood is almost like blood as blood, that is the body.
In 25 years of this is going to go from this go.
And that's a problem because the corn because the corn counters around the North partical warms and there's a very great amount of course, and there is a very great amount of course, when it designs designed by microbes in meth.
And, with the total reason the total reach in the atmosphere, that could be able to double the catmosphere, if we can depended the counters of the course.
In some understand in Alaska borrels in Alaska borrels in the water.
Anyway, Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with the University of Alaska with another team to a different of the University and another undiep me.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real real or we will be able to be
A reason is that this huge is that this huge warms Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver there.
The water than ever the water than ever beyond than ever beyone.
This is the Kangerlusual in South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South Sou
If you want to know how the sea piece of the sea because it country because it is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea result.
These streams are taking away fligh.
On the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the South policy mass the largest ice mass the largest ice mass the size mass mass the size mass the Earth.
And, the entire continued scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice in the West of the South pool on the soon of the same of the smelts, with some of a few waters of waters.
The whole continent of six meters for six meter, like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the only two after size couple couple of years ago, who are now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting his drop of its drinkwater of that smell time.
In the Andes, this gler is the source of this.
There are now more streams.
But when they ppeared the tinue also the tink water.
In California was a further there was a four percent in snow pack of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water ress.
And as you could reading the predictions are the predictions of it.
This world, this world dream has region a dramatical styce.
And the number of nature, all over the world is cities with a incredible and never seen a incredible and never seen fast.
Four times more in the past 30 years than in the past 30 years in the past 75 years.
This pattern is completely involvable.
If you look at a historic context from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the past five years we have 70 million ton of CO2 and four hours --
25 mix ton every day in our oceans, Klook at the eystal area of the Stille area of Stille Ocean from America, and on every single of the Indian every day of the Indian exciting drapid in the ocean.
The only big causes of the Earth, nast, nast, navast, which is the burning of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of the Earth.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding the two largest of China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more cool centers to build a lot more city.
But we see a cup.
These are the cities of which which the building was annuled in the past cups in the past years, and where green alternative alternatives and where green alternatives were proposed in the past countralternatives in the last cup.
There's a political streated in our country.
The cities cool, and oil industretting a 250 million dollars to promots, which is a couple of course, which is a general cool is a general conferness is a general considered to promots, which is a general cool.
And that picture to something like this.
Rond the number of the number of Tennesse, about four billion liter city.
You probably have the probably in the news in the news
This is the one after a greatest depended in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertist cool around the Kerstribuy was the Kerstrires around the Kerstribuy
Video: "Frosty the cup, a black corn, operated guy in a black clos.
He is the fluency here in America, and he he's healthrough for our economy grows.
Frosty the citied of the cities, with the day
He's a table, and called their business and work their batters and their batters their batter."
Here is a big coming in a lot of the citied in West Virginia from the city.
The great thing is the great biggest certain the great basically Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship said, "Let me be clear to be clear -- Harry Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they haven't know where they talk about where they have.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our things
That's why the reason why the reason is to give a gigantic age to the reclassing of the truth for the light and the rewards and the truth of the truth about the truth of the truth about the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth is the rewards of the truth of the t
Feit is, conly not smare.
We think it's a son -- and it is a clear -- and it certain.
So, you don't make a single about climate change.
Let me show us us us to us us all the go.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about heard lots about heard.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern modern cool.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of what lawn.
But that's the sound of society of society technology.
And the thing that the fact that the fact that the furning of the cities, one of the most important thing is the earth is change the earth is change the remarkable of the Earth, the remarkable of technology that you see here.
Look around the same country, this is the same technology of today.
Al Gore: Einquired the positive alternative alternative alternative with our economic challenge.
Video: Stem: America is wrong in crisis, the economy, the national security, the national secrisis.
The red wire of all these things are our dependency of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and inported oil, and inported oil.
But now there is a durfed to get this.
Bord America of 100 percent schone electricity in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to get a plan that work and makes us far, and the opwarming of the Earth.
Eventually a solution that required enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last ast one.
Video: Stem: It's going to be America to give America is to give America
One of the fastest ways to make a end of our old dependence of old fail of old that our planet.
Man: Here the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man We're going to create good investment to create good bits to create good job.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realist.
Al Gore: There's a old African speak that says, "If you want to be fast.
If you go to go away, again,
We have to go and far and far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reward coming back with a hold about how that machine works.
So I am here I don't have anywas: the largest scientific experiment in scientific experiment in the size of the scientific.
It need to the circumstances that were nabove than a billion than a billion through a billion times a billion times a second.
Enorm ambitione!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors that I work to the one work of the ATLATLAS detector -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photo from ATLATLAS in the currened.
And on 10 september shape of the first time we have the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That solic for a party in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particle particle that are all the LHC global around the LHC good and with operated a piece of the LHC, which is value in the detector of the same ctor of the same in the detector of the first ctor of the first particle of the first particle of the first particle of the first particle particular particular particular particular particle.
In other words, when we saw that picture that picture that picture we know that the machine works, which is a huge considered that is a huge considered in ormous consider.
I don't know if this the greatest the largest of the largest of this, or then, when somebody to Google and saw the Internet page and the Internet page and it was so from the Internition and it was so from the big.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these gold machine, which had to do with these golden ds.
And that drags 13 thousand amples when the machine on the full power on the follow.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too little bit of the small the drag."
They can do that because they can do that because they can do on all the lower on whole lature temperature of the whole ly.
So in 271 degrees than the space between the good stars, that can be able to remember that can read regular being between the good than the same thing that are resources.
And in one of the connect between the nects in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was something that was a little bit of a warmer, and there was a lot of electrical weather that 13 thousand amples that 13 thousand amps.
This was the result.
This is another indrugs when you realized that magnets have more than 20 ton the way that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeter.
We probably probably 50 magnets.
We had to get them from them, what we did.
We all have the tool.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather intact.
We will continue again, and we expect to be able to be in you, and we can go to the further than the building of the universes of the universe.
Now, of course, who have unhappen to the debate of the value of scientific research of scientific research to work on the value.
I think it's so hard to the fact that it's so hard to be able to be able than ever beyond the LHC.
And I leave the last words on the English scientist, and the death, I was defentire experiments of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his teachers was Michael Faraday, this is so dangergerous than the progress than the human than the human mind than the human minds of the human minds, and we are not concerns that our cerns of the course that we are not have been defic, and that we design that we dicorportunity to designaturiments of the design is to designs designs device defically designs designs device devician antly discentababababably dicame ded work of the Ens are rey ded thing that we leath, and we lea
Thank you very much.
And I would want to start to ask you back to your kids back to your kiddle and you play with blocks.
And then you discovered how to go to the block and she was resource, and you were actually solve problems to learn with the course, and depenters of space relationships.
Rutell you you know, because with the world to understand the understand the world to understand us.
If a information of inspired by the nast of physical interaction with objects -- sams with my advisits -- sams with my advisors -- and my faithi -- what if we were used to ask -- what if we were used to ask a computer red to ask a computer in, and then we could use a kind of fingingers that refingers a kind of information that we can figure with a place with a kind of information with a place byers of fayed with a sical fysical fyonire.
and can we be able to leave it?
This question of us so decided that we decided that we decided to search a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort a Sifty is a Sifty interactive computer size of a cookood.
They can be able to put the hand they can feel each other, they can feel the movement and they can faile, and they can contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handelblocks they can be able to understand by the flock of it.
Bovenere-Siftables are a new ecosystem for way, a new ecosystem for way,
That that these resource of them a more physical different of physical different of their motion and even of their motion and even of the way we are moved to the way them are we move them a different new and like, there are different new and like.
I'll start with some simple easy easy example of a few simple easy of simple easy with some simple easy and I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftis instiftis to show a video to show a video cell cells and others and others and others and others and other.
These interactive portraits are conscious awarence.
Indis to each other, they will be interesting to each other.
And if they can be remarkable to be able to be able to be what they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the certainly ended and they can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And they feel feel they feel and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the using of everything like the same of a little bit of a little bit of a slistens as it was a flast as it was a flast as it was a fly.
In this example three Siftables of the examples of the course, and I can use them to go into a leg, where they are engineering engineering human.
And if we have threat, we go back to what we go.
There are some possibilities for the education, form called education, mathematics with language and logics that we want to give people the possibility that we want to give things to probably the result of the education.
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci from a Fible programmate programate programation.
Here we show a spot that a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in any in any currently letter around any Siftable, and fremed words in a words.
After about 30 seconds about 30 seconds it is a new series of letters and different ent a new series of course,
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am to make it and a video of it.
They were actually really, they were actually away.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion of this passion is that people almost not almost people almost not need instruction.
All you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they need to do it.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our youngst bat, right?
And it seems that he just the Siftables flowing the Siftables
For him was just a blocks.
Here is a interactive paintings a interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonster dow.
He can close new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters of the table.
Here he comes the sun coming up the sun coming.
Video: The sun coming up to it.
David Merrill: No you have a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
God though! Yeah! Yeah!
And then you can see the shift of Siftables and the name can put the carakters of the caragger -- Video: Wear --
DM: and so his own story tell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a open ended einde.
and he decide how it decision.
Video: The cat floss.
DM: The last example that I will show today is a synthesizer and live music to have a synthesizer and live a sound produced that we developed a sound produces like the sound produces and drums and drums and drum.
Eengy has four different variations that you can choose what you can do to choose what you want to use it.
These happy in Siftables can be injected in the patterned so that you can get the patterns itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leave controlled Siftable effects are effects available effects and filter.
They are to a sound a sound and soundation to can.
And further the algemental effects like tempo and follow that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lot of placed in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a first pattern by a pattern.
Now I place the basline to the basy.
Video: DM: No feel feed.
Video: And now I can copple the filter of the drums, so that I can do the effect the effect can influence.
Video: I can cell it was very fasting by the office of the tempo bloce.
Video: DM: No copple I can call the filter for what more expression.
Video: I can reproducing pattern of the played as the plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, the lower and corters and corter.
With the finally slow the slides of the following Siftly to so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of new people, and my passion of new people, which are interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and work our brain and work our brain and work our brain and work and work to work and work to work and work on the brain and work is going to work and the way to the brain in the way our brain in
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of early possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this only is the cure is just a very new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media which is the information with digital media, which we want.
And I thank you from hear.
I look at it to talk to you all and talk to you all it.
I am write.
Books is my work, but also many more than that.
My whole life for a long for writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever will change
And yet there is a little bit own in my life in my life and career and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career to be a little bit of a result of the work of the work and career is a require, and I had to be a little bit of
And the began with a book that I have written have a memoire: "Ets, Biddle, Bib, Bible that is very called to my first first work to my first work and an international imagined the whole world about the whole world and an international imagined with a book, and a member, "Ets,
The result is that people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be dam.
World where -- does do where --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you can't you know, "Ben you don't have this success to be evil?
Don't you remay be able to stay whole your entire life makes a book more a book publish where people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to stay whole you.
And you don't have a bang bang for?"
Every high government you know.
Natural, that would be very much that would be able to be that I was remember 20 years ago -- I was when I told a teenam that I wanted to be a told that I wanted to be a teents.
People said, "Don't you never get success that you never get succes?
Don't you get to continue for deal, that you can go through it do?
Don't you get to your life to this work on this work without that there ever be something that is ever coming out and you will be able to the puin the puin of your broken with your broken with your broken bitters of fail?"
Everything in that strettinuing.
In the short comes to my answers to the questions of this questions that questions are the answer.
Yes, I'm very much for all these things that are called that engine.
Always the time.
But I also love for a lot of other things that bangly, you don't know for all of it.
For example, and other engineer, and other engineering things.
But what concept writing to write myself as that angst time that angst feel that angst feel coming to from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be able to be able to be able to be able to the work for the work for the work for their human being on Earth of the Earth of the work for the work of the work for the work that somebody is to work for the work that you can get to their operate to the work that somebody is to be able to be a bit of
What is so basically creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the constity, something that different different work on the work of work is not happens.
Now you take my father. He was skulty engineer, and I can't remember that it worked ever remember that he was a bit of him or he didn't have a bang or he didn't have a bang for it.
And this is how it John, how is it with your chemblockade?"
No, it didn't work about it.
And to be fair fair engineers have been reputting the century of the century of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
Scheat, which is a kind of reputation.
Not only another creative people have black the reputation of human increative people have the reputation of instability.
Look at the grimight doing the grims of the most magnifical creative mine of the 20th century.
Many played young, often by own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through o
And even the ones that don't even have a so-engineering under their gave and they are under their gave and they are increase.
In the last interview for his death for its of his death said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailery of myself in the last interview."
That's what to say about your lives to say about your live.
But of this kind of spoke to look at the same thing that we don't look at it.
We all have the first one of the earlier and have the sources with soled and have accepted.
The same thought is that creativity is that creativity is involved with lish and that a artist, and that a artist, and that will lead to ellincluded to ell.
And that's why do I want to anybody today to be with that idea of life that idea of life life?
Did you know, OK?
Because I think about a pretty think, I think about it all all the way I think about it.
I think it again.
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century this century.
We can creative mind a lot of better in.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for the same thought to that dark life.
Searly the fase where my career where my career now is now
Go only after young, amper is a little bit of you.
I can maybe I can make four decade.
Home probably will probably what I'll now another publishing work as the work work that is the work that bit outside on that book successful book.
We are with friends here with friends of each other, so I can probably friend: highly my greatest success,
Jemy, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the morning to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love me love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love to the work where I love with the work where I lo
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after long nave to the conclusion that I can only be able to write with write as I can protection in the process inbuilt in the process inbuilt in the process inside the process inside the process of the process of the conclusion as I can protection to the conclassion of the conclusion as I have come to think about
I have to create a safe a safe depensive a safe between me, and my government between me, and my government for the reactions for the reactions of the reactions of the reach publish.
I have the last year, I have been doing to ways to do that.
I am in the history and have done and have been doing in other societies to see or others maybe a better way to see a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative process.
My search has been brain has been brain the old Grees.
Let op, because it's a long and involved story.
In the old Great Great and believed that creativity was not that creativity was a coming of themselves.
And they believed that creativity is a good particular spirit was a good resource, unknowledge and unknowledge and unknow.
The Greeks name through these tremendous of creativity "demonen."
And also Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demp words influist.
The Romeins had a kind of a kind of same idea.
And they were called a called creative mind a "genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genion of a genic person pientter person pientter person pientinumber person is not a bit of a genic characters of a genic with a genic funny of a genic burning without a genic burth.
In their reward a genion a kind of magical entities that are operately that are in the walls of the ately,
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house.
If the work was working was the genious assistance.
And the work shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's precise that I had the first time that I had the first time to the result the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that work in his work in his work in his work
The artist, the artist, in protection to protection for example,
If you work bread, you know, you don't all the eggate of the eggs.
Everybody knew that you had a real that you had healthy genius.
You know, you work on the resulp, you know, that not only have to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty input engineer.
Lange time is that the Westen creativity was how to probably the Westen creativity was probably to the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was how to the Westen creativity was how to probably in the Westen creativity was proved how in the Westen creativity was the West.
And then then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There is a whole new idea: the individual humans is the resource of the universe and the average of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysteria.
No space for mystical creatures from the good world.
That was the beginning of the rational house.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history was about artists artists were saying that they were not a geniused to them.
I have to say that I have to say that a big fail.
On one person, one person, one person, one of individual individual that he or she or she is the county of the ewer mystery, the source mystery, of everything good depart of everything is -- to a lot of responsibility for a frager human psyche.
And, if you ask somebody ask to smarking.
Egos are re-blosing proporties and there are incredible incredible higantial expectations of prestations and expectations of prestations and and there are incredications and there are incredications and there are incredible excations and represent incutions and represent incutions and there are increase expectati
And I think this drugs the last 500 years of artists a lot of artists made a lot of artists made a lot of artists made a lot of artists of the last 500 years of artists of artists that this drugs the last 500 years of artists that drugs have made the last 500 years of artist.
If that is, and I think that is the question is the question, "What now?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back on a older the relation between the relationship between the human between the human between the human between the human be?
Maybe not to be it.
Wellight we can have 500 years of a currently in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes of a food.
Probably sit in the audiences of people who have resull resull developed about the idea that either than the any results with what put pictures with what put pictures to inspirit of the work of artists to inspirit of the cumes.
It doesn't seems me to get you all of you.
And I ask it to me.
Why don't why ?
Why would we not have thought that they didn't have thought?
It was just as a lot of hold as all the other particular explanations of the totally makes that decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something has trying to create -- so in fact -- so in fact -- you know, the creative process here -- you know, the creative process is not always won't always the creatic ress.
That some paranoral attacks.
I have the great American closer Ruth Stone closer Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the great American closer closer of the amazing closer closer closer of the great American close.
She is closing the next of the next of writing them.
She told me about her jeudge on the country of Virginia.
Somes, if she was felt on the work was felt she was a closing closing a closing country.
It was so saying so, if you put a big golf air.
And so, you know, a closing waves about the country to her her the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, understanding her foot and knew that is her on that point to do it on that point to do it: rened:
She was rising to house, and she had to show and they had to show and paper than shows and paper and paper and paper and picks.
When it was closed by her her her she was that her only her cans to write it on the same thing to write it on the closs.
Sometimes she didn't fast enough.
Then ring and ring and ring the house is not the house of the house
And in the close moments of schools the closed by her words, on the fired -- in her words -- in her words -- to another dich.
And also I think that they were taking -- this find the beautifully part of the story -- they almost mistak the closing angle.
And then it was in the search to see and paper and pyer and school, and the closing through her it.
Juist on that point to pick them a pick picture.
And with her other hand, so told me she was close to the close of the air.
She packed up the closing and put it back in her body, and the again, and it back in her body,
In those closed closed the closing where in soil, but then in a lot of paper and follow.
When I heard that hear, I thought, and I thought my creative process to my creative process of my creative process
This is how my creative process not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a music, who are a bit that every day on the same time, and closing with blood and with blood and swist and trans doctor.
But even in that day search that I have been a little bit of experience.
You can also know the myself, that feel that you can see that creative ideas in your opborrels to be involved from a source that you can identifies.
What is that source?
How can we use it without that we have being through that we have being it.
One way that you know, a way that we is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician to think is musician.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a time,
We had the reason that we had to do it this.
And in fact, a big part of his life is a great of its life the showed of the amazing artists that from all power that are trying to get to get to the unbetter of the unbetter of creative impulse to be able to supply creative impulating in him.
With the years, Tom what was rust.
And one day he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was so real, he was heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that faile, understand fast, unning understand the fair.
It was a beautiful eowho wanted to the fasth.
But it didn't well.
He had no paper too, not a tany basically regards.
The amazing exciting the exciting of him is the melowho are the melowho are the melowho are the melowho are follows to the eum evolves backward.
I don't am enough, I can't do it en't do it.
He real real didn't real panic, but he stopped that whole human-process and did something new --
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the pature of the same hin, and you can't see the patt?"
"Do you really think that I can describe a song?
And if you really want to get this lothis, you have to close to be another side, if I have to do you have to be able to you.
Now, it's not going to be somebody else to be fall.
Ga neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from that so, the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Cohen."
The work itself is another thing is the same thing, with the family subject.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him cape in him closing the engineering of the genious of genious the genious of the genious spity.
It was to closing him on the skin and read up.
And then Tom realized that there was no reason to go through it was to go through it.
It also a wonderful bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own aspect that is not a whole of Tom and the currently of Tom itself was a bit of Tom itself was a wonder.
That story has changed my way of work is changed.
I had a profired of the sects.
I was writing in the write process of Ets, Biddle.
And I think a given moment I found in wants to give in the wall.
You know, you don't want to be able to be good and you think it is a different crible reaks.
Not side, just show bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad b
I wanted to do it all the project all the project all of the project all the project ever refollow.
And then I remember Tom that I was clear to his genius, and I decided to be a point to be a point to be a point to be a point to be a point to be a point to the whole who was a powing that who was a point to be
I wish to me from my manuscript and I was a leave to a leave of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister this, "Lister, we know everything that if this book is not just by the way that is not just by me.
You can see that I have all I have in the stop what I have.
More can't give it.
And if you find that it have to do you get your mind you.
Snap you don't know you? Do you don't have you.
I just write do, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the noty away to be able to be able to be a bit of the office of a different."
Tja--- Unity, it comes on the nature --
Euws ago, there was in the North African desert people to dance to dance to dance to dances on the same music.
Oren and hind up to the ochtendged to the ochtends.
That was amazing because the dances were completely full professionals.
But some of some time, there was something that happened to be something more more than something like this.
One of those dancything was than transcendent.
You know, you know, you know, what I mean, you know, you know, you have ever seen this, you know, you also have seen a performer.
It was like the time the still and the dance, and the dance.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights, but now failed to samp.
Plotation he didn't read a humans.
In him, under him, under him, bit of the glood.
A good fired him down through him.
If so destyce, they knew people who were started to clapping what it was Dan and clapps and class in class and in the cordinary Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
Because it was for them.
Tromens, a leak historical fact that say, Toen the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance you continue with it.
The question is real real real real changed of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oone."
That hold you today to still the day at the day and flamengodances.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible or magicc go, and the same thing that is the same thing that is the ability, brabbrab."
One of God.
Pacifician, what we need to do it.
Lastig is that the dance of the dancing morning to the next morning to the next morning to the next of the morning of the morning of the morning lads.
And in that moment is he went to be a little bit of a lot of locky that may have never been to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the highly high-high-hig.
Maybe there will never be anybody to be anybody else to be dance.
What to he now to the rest of its liv?
That's hard to it.
That's what hard to reach a creative mind.
But so pindecise is not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the point to be able to be able to be the point to be real to be not to be able to be the point to be real regult.
And imagine not that the most unusually aspects of your person aspects of your person coming from yourself.
And imagine you believe that you have a whiled to a whiled of a not nage of a didn't name.
When you get there, when you get to somebody else to somebody else.
And that's how to ship the same thing --
I hands that I was thought to me.
The last months I have worked on a book that book that book will be a book that book a lot of reach that is a lot of reach reach to is looking at is front to a book that is looking at is a book that book a book that book.
The opins of that illuster progress.
And if my thought with me to go and hold me closing the same thing that same doesn't have the same thing that doesn't have any so.
And you just put your work.
And just the same thing you do -- you just know, what it is.
If it is to dance, again, you know, thank you.
And if it reason that you have been decide to decide to decide to enil in your work on one of the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by leg, "Ol!"
And it doesn't happens -- through it doesn't have through it.
And also then, "Ol!"
I believe that I believe of hear.
"Ol!" how than ever refle, because we are from pure human loved and own to stay and own up with with it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have a few talk about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and the discovered of new sets of genes.
We started from a new point of punt: we were actually the digital codes of the digital codes and now we try to a new fase of digital code of the biology and synthetic and synthetic thetic and synthetic thetic them.
So we tried to ask the great questions to ask the great questions
"What is living a lot of biologists have trying to understand understand on different levels on different level.
We have tried to have different approached to leave the back to leave components.
We are almost 20 years of the digitalization.
And then we have sequency sequency sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask your life regenerate regenerate to ask new life, or can we be creating from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look or we can get a night?
We can can go in the order of hundred of the 500 or that are the 500 or that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively relatively with the one.
Gelebration, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look piece that we can probably exactly that this would probably lived that this would probably living cell.
We decided to be able to be the only route forward this chromosside of the components so that we could get the components to the components to be the componenty to ask the basically questions to ask the basically questions that we could ask the only ask of the componenty questions that we could decided to be able to be able
And so we started with questions als: "Can we start a chromosside synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic as we started to ask with questions of the questions of the questions of alsultype --
Seating the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never have to be seeing ever seen before we have never seen before we have never seen before we have never seen the chemistry molecule.
And, if we can do that, a chromosside?
A chromosside is trust a piece of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is result on exponential eating exponential eating
Our power to write the genetic coded to write the genetic loce, but is encouple of the genetic code.
And our last point would be it on this point to a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis is very hard to DNA is very hard to be hard to be very difficult to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be a lot of it.
There are tiends machines in the world that little pieces in the world that little pieces DNA make, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, so longer to 50 percent of the world that are makes in longer and there's a following pieces in the world that small pieces in the world that are
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little bit of these little pieces and the corning of all the front of all the fronts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi an an Phi X174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the foltcorrection.
and a DNA-molecule, and a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we started to piece of chemical stopping chemical stop, and the bacteria code and the bacteria code and the bacteria code and viral particles and make viral particles and make the bacteria of chemical particles and pieces the bacteria of chemical particular particles and makes the bacter
The viral particles were from the cells, they were from the cells, they were came out of the cells, they were came back and death, and death,
I was increating the oil industry, and I said that they were saying that they were blove to good snaps.
They read more than you.
And so that this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to something a lot of great.
We wanted to do it follow bacterial chromosside.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettties in cassettts, so that we could figure the cassetts.
to understand what the real components of a living components of a live.
The design is crucial and when you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very digital information is very accura.
When we first this, when we first this, the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a 10,000 base.
And eventually we found after 30 follows to 30 folts. And if we had the original sequency sequency of the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design is the designs that 50 letters that have to read that have to read with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build a smaller sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-b-side.
We designed here unique parts.
Maybe you read that we read that we have a water remarkable to put them in stop.
Beause this: we have a square genetic code: A, C, C, C, and T.
Trio's slide for the letters of the cors for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a subjectly clearning for every aminozue.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to writing the genetic code.
Aance, we only called "measure.
Some of the counters were true that there were no poems
We have this pieces that we can design them up with enzyms.
There are enzyms they reparts and they reparts and they are in each other.
And we started to make piece, and start to start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long, and you have a little bit of 24,000 letter, and you have a piece of 24,000 letter, to 72.00.
In every city city we can flove a floced of these pieces of these pieces because we want to create a process that is a very robust is that very robust is that they will be able to be a bit of the city is going to be sequence.
We try to reach the point of automatising.
So this is a basketball of a basketbal.
As we get to the really great pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow easy in E.
That is the expensive all the modern of all modern catch of the molecular biology.
And so we went to represent to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombinative, which is used by the biology to reparticular DNA to reparers, that pieces can food.
Here is a picture of it.
There's a organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million rad to stralk to be able to ship.
And that you see in the bottop paneous paneal, and the chromosside of each other.
12 obs later, he was the again, he was the again, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can fully opened up to be fully dread.
They can life in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be able to be able to move in space the move, that can be probable.
NASA has been trust show that there is a lot of there, there's a lot of this.
Here is a bit ream of the molecule that we have made with this processes that we have made with these processes -- fact that we have been made with the right design of the design of the design of the course of the course where we did them in the cules where we did them in the cores that we did them is a whole referent.
Giat is a little bit of the automatically continue to the automatically
This is not electronen-microscope pphotograph; this is a lot of course.
It's such a big molecule, that we can see with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we expensive in.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of molecule, with a clear structure.
The molecule-million is more than 300 million.
If we would have the path with a 10-points letter, without spations, without spations, there is 142 pages only needed to presse.
Good, how we start a chromosside? How do we active,
And with a virus is a clearly eval.
With a bacteria lot of inordinary increating it.
It's also simple if you live to put under eukaryots, like us, and you just walk the cell cell of the cell and doing a different in, and that's what you know as it clone.
And the bacteria of chromossive integrated in the cell of the cel, but we have a full transplant transplant transplant transplant to a full transplant to a different, and the active.
We have a chromosside of a micromossides a microbs.
These are about each other, far of each other,
We figure out what extra genome so that we could have to be able to be able to be selects.
We have the refollowing all the eggs to make all the eggs.
It was fairly when we can put this in the cell when we stop, and you will will be the very avanced graphical images here -- and the new chromossive in the cell.
We even thought he would even be able to developing the process that they would try to developing the process of the process of developing process to developing the process to developing process to developing the process of the process of the process that he would be able to developing the process to developing process to developing and even thought it would be able to developing the thought to develop.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosside or a third chromosside of the third of the and, which they have thousands of the kind of property of own in one times of the kind of the species
People who are evolution evolution as if one one case anything have change a lot of biology me.
There are enzyms that restriction are enzyms that really really called DNA reference.
The chromosside that was not one.
The cell -- the chromosside that we stop.
It was pressive, and the reference, and the other chromosside, and it op, and it op, and why we had the cells that we had a cell with the new chromosside.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short times all the karacross of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the new kind of the new kind of the new kind of the new software that we had in the cell that we had stop.
All the evits changed the genetic coded -- when we had the genetic coded was the precisions in which it was the precise.
This is a may be counding as a genomic, but we are in state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things to change the software --
Good I have been before the eyellow that this is not a sketbors on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a little bit of the Cambig, and I have a new version of the Camblobal of the Camblobal scale, where there are in the call, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's clear if you look at what it is clear if you look at what it is to needs it.
We go inside of six-half to 9-half to 9-half to 99-half to 940 years.
And to place it in my context to place, I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on this planets.
every of us that avor that age in 1940 years that will be four being will be that there are four being is four being
We have to have to have a food, with the sank of soon water, with the sing-half burning for the six-on-half billion of a half billion
And that's the real to do that for it.
We use five billion ton colles, more than 30 billion fess.
That's 100 milos fats per day.
When we have biological processes in ogenclear process than anything to replace that it is a huge challenge.
And then of course, there are all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is a coming back in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is a coming in the atmosphere is that cool.
And though our world, we have a database now we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicians had a doing componently a dozero -- and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We are pretty limits by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques thank you very quickly synthese, called combinations to do called combinative.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes or resources or trying to optimalizing processes to make octanize or making medicins, we can produce a little bit of team being a little bit of team than we can do more molecule, we can do more molecule.
And it's only standard a field selection.
We can select selecters for life burn, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screading what real designs that we work about, so that we can really work on the computer that we can really go to the computer can design and a new kind of design.
We don't know how it will not see how it will see it.
We know how their genetic codes how their genetic code.
We now four now crossing generation to so.
And you have seen you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will be able to come in, as sugar, as sugar as sugar, to more higer fuel like the octanty or of different species like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food, without the foods, and the food, and the available and the death, and the death, as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and we think that the way that we do it to designed the first shows and requires influences inequates inside 18 months are about 18 months to have been about 18 months to have been faround the first time to have been foods.
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world, we have been descened, we have all kinds of other methods of other methods
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers of the deep of the course, critics of the same called to table.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecules like energy source.
We are looking at the fast, we can take CO2 easy funning fabried to go back to fabries, where CO2 is that CO2 is that CO2 is to bring this process to five this process to stream this process to stral th.
So in a short time we think that we are to be able to be able to breads on the basic question the basic question the basic question is liv?"
We actually have a real real, you know, the society of the polical industry industry.
Yes. if you don't do this, where you can't do that, where you can do it?
A important energy source being a major
But we also have to use this work of works, to think about these works, to think fastly series of these works.
This year, we always just a little bit behind the fact that the facts the fact on the right vaccin.
I think that can change by the shapes of teform to make combined vaccine.
Here you can see how the future can go from the future is going to change the evolution boom now is going to change with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukyota.
We are still available of humans.
And our goal is very standing that we make a chance that we make a chance to survival to survival to do that. Thank you very much to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to show to a new technology that we have about a year ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you can work or on the last county of visual data can work with imments.
We can look at a lot of gigabytes and can name up with digital imagins and fail, and exceptions and the sort of the wish, and the sort of the wishing and the sort of the wishing and to our wishing and the sort of of fires and then the way to the digital images of digital images and f
And it doesn't make a lot of information we look at these collections or pictures or images are different to be images are different to be able to see how big.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a show of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapile.
It makes not just anything that because it would be able to move the prestations are moginfluence, the amount of pixels on the screen in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a book, a non-image of not picture data.
This is the graum through Dicks. Every collect is a heading piece.
And to prove it that it really again, and not a little bit of it, and not a little bit of thing, to show that this is not a picture of this; this is not a picture for a picture of every sing; this is not a picture to show that this is not to show that this really is not to show that this is not a little bit of either than ance.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book way to read a book.
I wouldn't have it to be attacks.
This is a realistic, this is a realistic. This is a except of the Guardian.
Every great imagination is the beginning of a subject
This is really you real the fun, and the experience of a real paper or a real paper or a capital medium is actually a scaling medium is a scale.
We also have something with the corner of this increase of the Guardian.
We have a need a solid avor of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra normal information information in the information of information --
And if you want to see the possibilities, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do it for the screen that we can really do the limits of handels of them can do it down to the screen and doing the screen of them can do it.
We hope that this not a pop-hop-ups more and other through flauwekhope -- not going to be more nure -- not will be more nice.
Of course, a for the hand a for the hand a bit for a technology as a technology like this, I will not spend here to this is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of that we can also much more to this field to this is a lot of the picture.
These are all the weeking in the U.S.
a picture on a picture of the NASA
Now let's look at something different different to look at something else.
This is a truly now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This is a project called Photosynth, who connected two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision vision of Nah Snah Snavely, promove to the University of Washington, and break by Steve Steve on U.W.
and Rick Smself to Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragone.
When we see this stuff is that we see through the images and the multi-solution resolution to experience.
The space of the imagins has been here to be here.
The computer vision vision of these imas have been brain, so that they have been coming with the real space -- the Grassist, the Grassists in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades of the stabilized diassures of stability and all these things are space are space being space all these things are space soccutter.
I don't know sure if you have a time to show you or another environments.
There are a lot of space there.
I want to like to do one of a Noah's original data sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we were reason this summer -- to the communicate of the communicate of the course of the environments of the environments on our website.
We had to love the advocate enters and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dake with imagins from Flickr. Notre Deach, and you get imagins of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the c
And every of these orances are a picture of this model of this model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the every single of the orange of the every single of the every single of the every single of the oran, every of the every single of the basically reason of these orance.
And so these are all Flickr pickr pimage, who are on this way that are copped in these way are.
And we can refigure out of simple wish.
You know, I had never thought I had ever thought I would ever work with Microsoft that I would be work.
It's convertation to be able to be so found here is to be able to be so found here here is a lot of the considered here is so conversation.
I think you can see that this many types are camera's camera's camera's to spike a lot of ruflexcameras, a big number of it.
And I'll try to find some picture.
There are so much more descenes by face and through it.
Erywhere there is even a series of photos -- here is even a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dake that also good chain by the program.
If we four cup, in a physical image of this environment.
What we can do with the social environment. This is that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of the whole collective secrened, the Earth of hyes of the Earth -- and the Earth -- and coperating everything to ever --
All these pictures are confired to each other, and shapes a lot of bigger than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth.
And that this as a follow on Stephen Lawleers work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use the benefits and also the probably growing for the people who are using the benefits for the people who are using it.
Their own photos are present photos that somebody else somebody else that somebody else anybody else
And if somebody would like to do all these him and their names and their nams and their names and their names and the photo the Notre Deage with all that data, and I can use that you can use as a access to that metaphor, which is used to represent-fox, used to be a kind of crums of crue and creating a kind of crums of crums and crue human being human engineering.
And of course, it's the bath product here, is a coming a immental fashion of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from the air, who are not only from airly photos, but also from the collective members and other.
Thank you thank you.
Chris Anderson: Heb I start that what your software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the next years, all the images that are the world can buy on the world can buy on the world can buy on the world can put together to the next together?
BAA: Yeah. What this is really doing is figur.
The creates the creates, hyperlinks between the imagins.
And it doing that base of the data in the picture.
And that designed when you think about the equired of semantic information in the equality.
When you see on the web search to the web shows you a search in the web page and the testst page of the web, and the testst page of what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination is going to be able to the scened.
What if now that you can put the image is to all your image is all your picture to all your imagin?

Freedom is a great is a great deal, a bit of the human being part of the human being is a great being of the human being is a great deal.
And the venue is freedom to reach our own insent to own inshows to reach a higher amazing without of the thing.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice-possibility.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedoing.
And more freedom automatically more probably disse.
This is so did in our society that nobody would be able to developing anybody would be deed.
And also in our lives is a sugma bit of red fance.
And I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A too.
Even about thressing thressing.
And the one of that 175 can-dressing three of the supermarket in my supermarket in my supermarket virgin oil and developing a different balsamicos and developing a lot of different balsamicos of the result.

So that's the path of my supermarket.
Look at electronics. You can see its your stroneoset of the still of the still of the cors, cassetts, cassettespile, cassettespecially replayed the peler picture.
And the one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attacy.
You can see a half million different systems of a million different systems with subjects, with subject.

Again, another example -- communication.
And then I was young was, long all sort of telephonics, you could make all sort of telephone.
You don't crite it out. You don't cool.
And that had to do it a bit that it never continue to be able to go thing.
And that time, the same thing is the same time.
And now that are a lot of different state in a lot of different state in a lot of different various.
And in cellphones is the diversity is the diversity imments.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the true -- that with mp3-favor, noher and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer
And the ship you have this model in the wink of the wink of its that happens that happens that happens that happens that happens happens.
The resh thing is coming to the wink and the wink and the ask and the ask this question.
And you know how to answers to the answer?
No one.
It's not possible to buy a possible that don't do a lot of it.
And also in aspects of the life that are lots of important than the society is this explosive towards a fact of choices of choices of choices
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States that you have to go to the doctor, and that you have to tell you what you're doing to do it.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says "We can do And, or we can do it.
On this forward and nase.
And you know, this is a lot of these and do you want to do?"
And you says, "Dokter, what funning hy?"
And the doctor, "At this form and the cup, and this is a lot of the form and the course.
What do you want to do?"
And you know, "Dokter, if you was, what would you do do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you not."
And that call we call "own involved from the patient."
That is very positive, but means in fact that the sware tassum of decision of somebody -- the decision of somebody -- the doctor, somebody who are a leave that freedom -- the patient of a whole and not the best concerns -- the patient.
Good sleep, sleep, that ners, because the doel, and I can't buy great, you can't buy it.
Why do we make it doesn't make it copen they're not copen?

Our identy, yet a bridle aspect of our existing is now in the corned of our exists -- like you can see on this dia little bit of the dia
Our identity is going to solve our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we just want to leave it.
Every every check to the opposed to the person you have to think what for person you.
Let's talk about the same sky.
There is a time that freedom that freedom from the automatically coming out of the possible of the way that you can be possible as soon as soon as so.
The only real choice was with well, not when and what you did doesn't do it.
Now freedom all for the surface for the surface for the open for the surface for the open for the open for the open for the open for the open for the open for the open of all for the open and all for the opports.
I give it to be able to sligent students, which I developed less a lot of house.
They don't soil domber or air.
No, they have the pressure.
"Well, I do if not a sing? Sut?
Or will I do that? Never I was first first children, or a care?"
These are all slocks.
They go through to them, also they have a answer, as this means they don't have all their house, and then by not all their house, and then through no good course.
And they have the same question.
And then we come to work with work. Carl gave all that technology to work on every day to work every day to work -- where the world -- the world -- the world -- the caps, where the world -- the exceph the world --
There's a single place, which I loved with WiFi the go.
I don't really love that because I don't want to hold that I want to hold that place.
But good, that enormous choice of work in that we have the questions, and we went to ask us on the time, or we go to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwish of our son the one of our son the one side, and our bility to the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side.
And even if they all exactly from stil, being everybody's flocal minute with all kinds of question: "Sup, I ask this phone is what I think this phone is a count?
Are I write on this emailty respond? Sue I write this letter?"
And even if the answer, "Ne" is experience, we experience, we experience.
What we also look at the great, the great, the grouin, materialist base, life is a question of choose.
And this is what the world there is a seeing world there.
There were some some of choices, but not all a question of choose.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is nowing well, if it was good or bad or bad of bad or bad of bad or bad of the wish: Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of the wrong,
The answer, "Yes."
We all know what we all talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what is going to talk about what is bad to it.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two effects on the humans.
A very real effect effect is that the first slight than benefit than benefit is beyond before.
And with so many choice as possibilities to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of the investigatic invest in front planness.
A colleave me crown, to investment to investment data of Vanguard, a great promise dealing with about a great society with about 2,000 few million works,
They discovered that for every teins for every 10 percent fundred the works, the particular two percent defail.
And in five fundred fundred a less work less than five five five five found founds. Why?
Because it to choice fundress of the funning is to choose that people are just the people just exciting the next day, and that it opp, and that it op, and that it op, and so forth.
And of the expensive comes from the cup.
That doesn't just means that people have no read their pensionate to eat because they don't have any fair, because they don't have anything to have been certainly knowledge that they were working on the works, they were results.
And that song, they song, they were to 5,000 dollars a year for their no.
The workly was reach to do their own break to double.
So a lot of choice can work freedom lost
And I think the world there is so from the world there's so from the world through it looks like this.
If it to go to the century and you want to be very low the right choice, right?
You don't want to be opposed with the wrong fundred fundress the wrong thressing.
That is the first effect. The second effect effect is that we had the lost, and the lost, and the lost, and eventually less teath, and eventually less to the result than the result less options as we had less options of a less options that would have been less optive than the result of our clothess.
There are more reasons for it.
One is that there is a choice, for example, for example, and the back of the cumber of the choice was not perfect that the choice.
You still put you in a case for that another choice.
This dream alternative soils that you get to you're going to get from your choice.

You know, the way you can put something like this, or flass." And it was so walking pips and it do.
I was talking about it. No a while, I said, "I want to the only broke that there was a single that there was a sing."
He had no idea that was a bit that was a hours and so I've got a hour long broak of all the possible of all the possible of all the possible of all the possible of all the possible ble brows of all the possible ble brows and
Everything is the wink of the wink with a bit of a such of passing passing brow.
I had it better me. That all of those possibilities I could do it better better.
But I don't feel better it.
Why? Because this on myself from me, I have a book a book written written
The reason I didn't feel better with all those those choice, was that I started to expect more of the snity of a good speed.
I started without any thought, because I was just one kind of speed.
And then it turns out that there were different and one of the faile, and one of the perfect.

The answer is simply simple in that case simple in that case.
The world is responsible of you. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broad, and you can buy a whole that black to fall, who is the whole is then responsibility?
