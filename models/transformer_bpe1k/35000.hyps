Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, which is the past three million years about the size of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this underestimate actually the worst of this particular problem because it doesn't show the ice.
The ice capital in the North Pole is in a way, the climate heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and critical critical in summer.
The next slide I show is a speed version of what happens in the last 25 years of the last 25 years of happened in 25 years of happened in the last 25 years was happening in the last 25 years of the last slide of what happened is the next slide.
The permanentire ice is dived in red.
As you see, it looks at the dark blue;
That's the yearal ice ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The called ice, five years or five years or older is almost like blood is almost like blood is almost like the body here.
In 25 years is the from this to this in 25 years is this in 25 years.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Iceless warms and there is a very big amount of the big amount of carbon is frozen carbon meth.
Compassion to the total high-amount reins atmosphere, that could double the amount of the atmosphere, if we can describe if we were the crite of the course,

Whoo! What she's OK. The question is that we will be able to be that are going to be able to be that are going to be
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt aterriver --
The water volume is bigger than ever before ever bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuagest Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea level because it is the landics are game because it is the place where it comes in the sea.
These are taking closs.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Poll, on the biggest ice on Earth.
Last month, is reported scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole very quickly quickly quickly ever ears in the melt eating eds.
The whole continent is six meters for six meters are sea legisling as Greenland.

In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, disappears disappears in the drinking water.

Four more in the last 30 years then in the past 30 years then in the front of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unrelated.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 hours --
Twoton every day in our oceans, why in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, and on every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastical drifical dress in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, is designed to design the earth, which is burns for 20 percent monities of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and step is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extension of the size of China.
And there was a proposal to build much more stem of coal.
But we see a currently.
These are the stepping carbon the building was the building was annuled in the last year years and where green alternatives were proposed in the last carbon the years,
There is a political battle on the country.
The stee carbon and oil industire gave industire 250 million dollars to promote carbon dollars to promote carbon courage.
And that image me to think about something like this.
And the around of the Christs was in Tennessee, about four billion galler cool moddernavor of believed modlected in the home of four billion galler.
You probably have seen the news in the news.
This is the one after a largest direct in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

He is considered to be in America, and he's working in America, and he's working for our economy grows in America,
Frosty the coalman is being the day of the day.
He is paid and cutting and craflove and craflove and crabits their job."
And here's a big part of the urban carbon in West Virginia from the breaks.

That's why the reason why the most important purpose is to give a major required to advertising the light and the truth of the truth of truth and the truth of truth and the truth of truth of the truth of truth and is the truth of the truth is to give us to
Fit is, steps is not smart.
We find that clean is -- and it is still clean.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me just that but to us all over us.
Video: Acurrentor: Sue carbon about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermit in this hypermodern cool cup.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit more laws.
But that's the sound of clean urban carbon technology.
And despite the fact that burn burn is one of the most important causes of the Earth, changes of the Earth, changes the remarkable cits of the Earth, changes that you see all here.
Look around the clean urning carbon today.
Al Gore: Eincluding the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that at the area of national security.
Video: America is wrong crisis, the economy is the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red rod wire in all of these things is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pollue colls and inported oil.
But now there is a durfe, new solution to get this.
Fore America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to the work again, a plan that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth is the contected to the earth catch.
And eventually an solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the lat.
Video: Stem: It's about America.
One of the fastest ways to make an end.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good pay jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking that says, "If you want to be quickly.
If you want to go away together."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that machine.
So I am it. For those who were not one: the LHC is the most of scientific experiment ever experiment ever subjects, 27 miles in the course,
It must the circumstances that were requires that were less than a billion in a billion times a second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors and this is what I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS, in agriculture so you can see the scale.
And at 10 September last year we first put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party corner in the controlled room.
It's a picture of the first particle tary that all the way around the LHC went around the LHC went around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we had this picture that picture 10 Sept-Septber we knew that the machine worked,
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of this, or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these gold with these golden carries.
And those behaviors are 13 thousand amper that the machine on full power on full power in full power in full power in full power in full curious ago.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too little carrie."
They can do that because they can do superty superty are all low temperaturs.
So on mulin 271 degrees than the space between the stars, that can drags that can draw the stread.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was something that was happening to be warmer, and there was an electric resistance against 13 thousand ample together.
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realizing that the magnets are magnets more than 20 tons of away and they were about 30 centimeters to move inches were moved to move inches were moving to move inches that may take away that are about 30 centimeters were going to take about 30 centimeters to take about 30 centimeters to be more than 20 centimeters were going to be increasing about 30 centimeters were going to be moved more than 20 centimeters of the magnets were moving.
We designed about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them all repair.
Now they are back to way.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We'll be able to put it again, and we expect measure in June or June that we can go to figure out what the building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have happy that unhappy in the debate of the value of scientific research.
And I think the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go further than ever the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, during the device of his learning experiments of his learning was definiting was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous than to the progress of human spirit of the human beings of the human beings of science that are not going to be in the world and completely in the physical world and that are not completely being completely new world that there are no complearning our being in the work,
Thank you!
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your childhood time, when you played with blocks to play with block.
When you discovered how you had to go to understand how to figure out and consciously problems to learn by the country with the depenter relationships.
Rum insight is a strong because with the world to understand the world around us.
If an information -- I started to ask by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advises with my advisithi -- I started to ask Jee Kalanthi -- I started to ask -- what if we were using a computer to use that one mouse as a digital fingeral fingeral fingeral finger's went to a plate with a plate that information to a plate with both flat, which is the information we could fast,
and orders can we want to be able to orders and can we like?
This question is so decided that we decided that we decided to search by the building of Siftables.
Corns together is a Sift interactive computer in size of a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can move each other, they can feel their movement and they can take a screen and they can contact a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trades can be moved by understanding to it.
And then Siftable, Siftable, an example of ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And before these aid are a more physical different various different movement and even of each other, and even of the way we movement and even of the way we move, are different new new new and fun and fun and fun interactions and fun and fun interactions of them and fun and fun and fun and fun of interactions of them are movement of the movevement of interactation, and even of interactation, and even of interactions of interactation, and even of interactation, and even of the way we are movements, and even th, and even of interact to discovering they're movice we movice we movically diculpulps are movite of inter, and even fical condite we movities have a more internity,
I'm going to start with some simple examples of the simple examples of simple examples of simple simple examples of simple examples of some simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of the simple examples of simple easy.
This Sift is in the Sift to take a video that played to play played and others and others and others played for the requires of the reason is playing to do a video is played for a video is playing to play a video is playing to place a video is playing to play a video is play
These interactive portraits are consciousness.
And then they will interest each other to each other, they will interest in each other.
If they are real, they also do it and they can also fix it and can be some of the single of them being able to be what they can be suppose to be what they can be surrounded to be what they can be real.
And she feel movement and helling.
We realized algave that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting all of the interaction, as a bars -- as except of the interesting of a color as it was a liquid as a liquid as a liquid as a liquid --
In this picture Siftables are remarkable to use them to take color in a reading color in a reading color in a reading color in a reading picture.
If we have to save what we did sagree back.
There are some cappe possibilities for education, mathematics and logics and logics and logics where people want to spend things to try to try to try to try to try to try to see things quickly.
And here's the development -- this is the development of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic programatic programatic programmatic programmatic programmmatic programmatic shows --
And here we show you a game between a game between Scrable and Boggle.
The principe is that you get in every raround a randomness, every Siftable, and send vormed words are controlled in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary dicated in a dictionary dicated in every Siftable, and the principle of the boot boot of the
And after about 30 seconds is the very rescued is to rescued and several letters with breakthy-condition possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in to make it out to make it out to make it out to make a video of making and make a video of making and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need almost no instructions nearly nearly nearly instructions.
Everything you have to say, "Make word."
Here's some other people to test.
That's our young basically true typical tributty under.
And it seems that he just seems to the Siftable.
For him was just a blocks.
Here's an interactive paintings show.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the scene with that caractly the Sift of the table.
Here's slides the sun coming up the sun coming up the sun of here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene course.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done done ! Yeah!
And by the shaves of Siftables and the next to each other, he can reach other caracts with each other -- Video: OK!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open open on an open end.
and he decides how it divides it dists.
Video: The cat fly:
DM: The last example that I will show today is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed recent to produced every Siftables a sound produces and drum.
One has been four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use
And these sounds can be injected in Siftable, so you can determine you can detern ite the pattern itself.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the attern by the atterns of a leg Siftable effects are live controlled effects as reverb and filter.
They are to a sound of sound and addition to cancering and adapted by cancering
And so much as tempo and the entire effects like tempo and volume that are pattern of the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern by an extra lead.
Now I'm going to place the basically.
Video: Now I feel add a little bit slagwork.
Video: And now I pull the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can affect live influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate it by the obo block on the obo block.
Video: Now I buy the filter to the filter on the basas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rewritical rewing while it plays.
I don't need to planning everything to plann, but I can improvising it all longer and shorter as I want.
And at the end, at the dims of the end, by the volume solid Sift to left left to the left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new human computer interfaces that are interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brains and work our brains and work our brains and works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area design with some possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the touch to a very new generation to interact with digital media, which is the information to interact with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you all and talk to you.
I'm writing away.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm going to change all of writing and I don't think that ever will change in the entire life.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career in my life, and career and career to my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my life and career in my life and career, and care
And it started with a book that I wrote understand a memoire, "Eten, Biddle, Biddle, which is a very until my first work the whole world and a international experienced the whole world and an international existed the whole world and a international experience.
The result is that people all over the whole all over the whole I have to do anywhere I go.
Work what -- does!
People come to me and ask to me and ask concerned to me, "Don't you never afraid you can never ever be equate?
Don't you afraid you will stay your entire life writing but never describe to publish where people will be walk for hearm to be able to be heard for hearm to be heatt?
Don't you afraid that?"
Ery touchedge, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I was right that I was right that I was right at 20 years ago -- I was write at the time.
People said, "You don't you get to be success you're never going to get success of success is never going to get success of people who never get success of success you?
Don't you afraid for reference to suppose that you will go on through it.
Don't you afraid you live to this work without that it will be able to false to the public and that you will deade on the public of broken drown dreams of biter bittered your bitters?"
As in that strets.
In the short comes to the questions of that questions are doing this, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that are called
Always like that.
But I'm also for a lot of other things that all of other things that all of things all of things.
For sea leg, for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time that comes from, where that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically be able to be able to be afraid for the work for work for the work for work for the work for the work for the work of the Earth
What is so particularly so particularly what we worry to make us to make the effects of mind the effects of mindness is something about the work of work at all.
Take my father. He was a father. He was a disside, and I can't remember that there was a took at 40 years that he has asked to him in the 40 years afraid to him there afraid to was.
And how it said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry block block block of chemistry block?"
No, so it didn't work about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have to be able to be the centuries, not the reputation of the equal piece of manical depressive alcoholists.
And writers well, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have happened to be reputation human beings are instability to be instable.
Look at the grid death the most magnificant death the most magnificant creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by self by own own own own again.
And even those those who are not suicide myself, seem under their gaves under their gaves are own.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of extension we don't look at any more.
We all heard it before and have it all before all the accepted funded out of a bit before.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity to suffers are connected to sufferin suffering that an artists will lead to call lead to call lead to calready lead to call lead to call of the artists and that is going to be able connected to sufferin suffering suffering is that creativity to such a connected to mission
So what do I want to ask everybody tom today, can you ask with that idea life?
Did you get that?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think it doesn't do it all the way at the time.
I find it refright?
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see this century that this century is going to be so going to be like to see this century as well.
We can creative minds much better accors to live business.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to that dark to that dark thought of the same thought that was thought to that dark in the minute.
And seen the pase where my career now in my career now is now finds now.
You're going to be again, amper safty a doutside years.
I can may be four decade work.
And also highed everything will be seen to the outside world as the extractly as the world as the world as the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're friends under each other, so I can fail you set up in the way I can do my biggest success for me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you go think, you're going to be thinking about nine next hours to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love with the work that I love with the work where I love to love in the work where I love to love with the work where I love to love with the work where I love to love with the work that I love to love with the work where I love to love with the work where I love of the work where I love from the work of the work where I love to love to love with
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think the conclusion that I can just go by write with write if I protection in the process inbuilding in the process inside the process inside of the process inside the process of inside the process of inside the process of inside as I can do a psychological protection in the process of conclusion as
I have to do it a safe distance a safe distance between myself and my overwhile is very understand my overrate for the response to my future publishing to my future publications.
I did it for ways last year to ways to do that.
I have in the history of the history and have depends in other societies to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help creative process.
My quarea showing me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let up because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Roman and Roman people didn't believed that creativity was not a solid of themselves.
And people believed that creativity was a good spirit was a good spirit was a diviece, unknowledge and unknowledges to the human unknowles.
The Greeks called these basically called these spirit of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that was wise words influenced.
The Roman had a similar idea.
And if you were heard to them a called a geniused to a genius.
The funny is that the Roman is not a particularly person clearner person clearner person clearner person clearner person clearner person clearning is that the Roman is that the Roman is not a particularly person clearning with a genius to clip in a genius clear.
In their political entity was a genius, a geniused to be able entities that are ophiped in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artist was working was the genius was the genius was assistance.
And he shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier talking about the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work was going to be in his work.
The artist was in protection to the against for example, much narcism.
If you was brilliant to brilliant there.
Everybody knew that was an unvisible, you know,
Well, you know, you get a work on you, it's not just about you.
Everybody knew you had a rather unique inhanging genius.
Long time was that we have been considered to the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual human is the individual humans is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacks from the godnored world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity came from the individual came out of individual protection.
And for the first time in history was about artists artists were saying that they were a genius and not that they had a genius a genius.
I have to say that I find that a big wrong wrong.
To one person, one person, one is to take a single individual is the essentially the essenti, the source of the century of everything -- of all of the century mystery of everything is to be a lot of responsibility for a good human psyche.
As if you ask somebody asks you swalks in a click.
Egos are blowing up to giant proportions and there are unimagine proportions and there are unimagine to prestations of prestations to experience.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years many artists has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists in the last 500 years of artists are depended years of artists has made a lot of artists of artists has made a lot of artists that pressure has made the last 500 years of artists has made a lot
If that is, and I think, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back to an older understanding the older of relationship between the human being?
Maybe not maybe
And as we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes.
Probably there are probably people who have reading reading the idea that equal scientifics have the idea that elpass of the feed-like the work of artists to inspiring artists to inspiring artists to inspirate hights to inspirate high-like high-like high-like inspiring high-like inspire policy of the
It doesn't seem to be able to get you all get in that.
And I ask it away.
Why not?
Why would we do that thought wouldn't we need to next?
And it certainly as much as all other explanations of the totally calculatability that decided that decided to the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know that the creative process is not always ration.
That it sometimes almost paranormal.
I have recently directly the amazing American Ruth Stone meet meet meet Ruth Stone meet meet meet meet of the American meet meet meet of the amazing American dian means of the amazing American Ruth Stone meet meet meet Ruth Stone meet meet meet of the American Ruth Stone
She is in the next. Her whole lives all of life write poems them.
She told me about her right on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field was working on the felt of the country.
And it was, as if there was a big wave wave air, as if there was a big wave came air.
And it is poem golf than the country to her the country to her.
She felt that the ground under her feet her feel started to shake her to do and knew that moment but one thing to do is to do for her life.
She had to go home, back home, and she had to see so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible as quickly as quickly as quickly as quic
When the poem through her her came was that her ones her one was that her one.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then run, but run, it's not house it's the house --
And in fact, the moments her her homents close of of her search -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another directly.
And I think there were a several -- I find the beautiful part of the story -- that she almost have to almost of the story -- that she almost mistic.
And then she was in house looking for home and paper and poem poem through her it.
And Juist at that moment she had a pencility.
And she told me she told me she plucked the poem out of the air.
She picked up with his tail, and pulled it back in her body, as she wrote the way she wrote the way it writing.
In those cases came the poem wheel, but then in a very poper pieced in the case of paper --
When I heard that I thought, I thought -- what happens to do is my creative process of creative process of the creative process of the too.
That's my creative process is what my creative process is how to do that! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, which every day on the same time, and sweating the same time, sweating and trans with blood, sweating and trans it down.
But even in that day swer day I had such an experience.
You can also know it also to know that there are creative ideas in your borrels that there are creative ideas in your broiders that you can can can identify as well.
What is that for brone?
How can we use the without without we are going to be using the way to be using it.
At a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician example Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way to do it this.
And so Tom is actually a big part of his life had been showed to the same thing of the amazing artists that looks out of all power to the unition that tries out in the unition increative impulse that in him.
And the years, with the years, and the years was a little bit of smooth.
And one day he reflected in Los Angeles about the speaway, and changed it changed the process of radical.
While he got to said, he was so heard a fragmental of a melodia.
The decided to him, like inspiration that is doing does understand it.
It was a beautiful nice and he wanted to the hold hold and he wanted to be the vasthrough and he wanted to be the vasth.
But that wouldn't do that.
He had no paper, no paper -- no paper to them.
The well-famous exciting exciting exciting the melody to be the melody and then it stays me either equality of the familiar backys' equives of the familiar back to the melody remains of him
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't reflect in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the later on the catt?"
"Do you really think I can do a song on now is that I can do a song of song?
If you really want to get that this song is to be another one of you have to have another one for you.
Now, you can't go to anybody else did somebody else did
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohenence, the moment walked very different.
The work itself is the same thing with the familiar underto.
But the heavy exciting that the creative process in him when he distances the engineering of genius.
The genius sat him on the skin and liverted it and liver set up to the skin and living on the skin and living on the skin and liverted it on the skin and liverted it to the skin and living to close the skin and lived it on the s
Tom realized that there was no reason to go on it.
It could also be a wonderful bizarre sading, bizarre sading, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner that was not all the way from Tome to Tome himself.
That story has changed my way of working changed.
I had already ever had been in the way of second.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biddles.
At a corporating moment I am in spair.
You know that well, you want to work is not good to be a horrible disast. The bad book is a horrible book at it.
Not just just a low-bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad of bad of bad here.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project.
And then I remembered Tom that are wishing the end, and I decided to way.
I went from my manuscript and I did me to a crime, and I didn't have a reading of the room.
And I said, "Listen this, "Listen we know all this, we know all of this book is not just coming through myself is not only by me.
You can see that I have all in the way I have in the stated.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it have to do better you, you've got to do you.
Did you don't know that? Do you don't know that, understanding right.
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular is going to be disasaid that you are a differentype of office are differents."
Tja--- United it comes up here,
Euth ago came ago in the North African desert people together to make a monitors to make to move to move in sacres of music.
And hours and hours and hours to the morning gloors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes very single happened to be something like something like to be something like to be particular to be something like to happened.
One of those dancers was then transcendent.
You know what I mean with that, you know, what I mean ever mean, you also have seen something like a performer.
It was like the time silended and the dance of the time, and the dance of the patter.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights for everything.
And suddenly he looked like a longer only a human being.
In him, under him, under him is going to be field.
A fired fires through fired him.
If you happened to do something like this, they were people to clap and she started clapping and in cost called "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God God, God, God
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historically fact the Moren South South Spanis the Moren Spanish Spanis response to it.
The equivalent is being the centuries changed by the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other."
That you heard today in the died, and flamengodances and flamengodances.
If an artists in Spanist something that is possible does -- "Allah, other, other, well, broad."
Anyway, souldn't see a glimpse of God.
Precipies what we need to need.
Last, is that the dance of the next morning to the morning to the day at the day at the times at the morning in the morning is not good didn't have a good charged lam more lam didn't have a good charge more laad dive.
At that moment he is going to be a little bit ags in the way that may never before that may never will be more like this.
Maybe never going to be anyone God will never be anyone dances in the dance.
What should he now with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to squarter for a creative spirit for a creative spirit of a spirit of mind.
But so painful need to be it doesn't be it.
Imagine not that you have already aspects of your person common capture.
Imagine you believe that you believe them a while in a which,
When you get to ready with someone else, they are going to be able to somebody else.
That's what it considered is all that.
I high inside that thought.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside shortly will be appeared to be looking at a long time to be looking at a book that many came to be looking at a book that is to take a book that many came to be able to be able to be able to see.
The upon that illustrating progress progress progress progress
If my thought to the hold me to the same thing that I would like to do the same thing -- not afraise and.
Look, just your work.
Don't do this, whatever it is.
If you task you to dance your task is to say thane.
If the good genius that you is to decided to decide in your work at any time, in your work at any thing of the amazing sources by to leave through the wonderful source, "Ol!"
That's happening not, dance then, but thank you do.
And also than: "Ol!
I believe that hearts.
"Ol! OK, anyway, because we pure from pure human love and wisdom by stay by stay by staying plutters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had a couple of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean to mean and what that can mean to sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new points, we were the biology at digitizing biology to digital code to a new phase of digital code to a new phase in biology in the biology in the biology of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to do something that I think many biologists trying to understand on different level to different level in different level of level
We tried to reach different approaches to minimum components.
We're now it almost 20 years on the digitizing too.
When we have sequenced, the way it was from the analog world of the analog world of the biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now do we try to ask regenerate regenerate to create new life of life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a laboratory to a laboratory laboratory in a laboratory --
And we tried to look at a non-smaller genome can come to a non-smaller genome.
We can see in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or soon, which are there are 500 or soon,
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simply simply with the one.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all the genes we can look at the genes of a life is unlikely that this would be a life cell cell that this would be a life cell cell cell that this would be a life cell capture.
We decided that the only route prevalue to synthetic this chromosome of the components to synthetist as we could make the components to ask the components to ask the questions.
And so we started with questions as well, as we started to ask a chromosome synthet?"
And the chemistry the chemistry is the very big molecules that we never see before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome ""Se?
A chromosome of the way is marry a piece of chemical inercise.
So, our temmpo of the digition of digitizing life is acce:
Our power to write the genetic code lose of slow lose -- but is generating to be able to decline.
And our last point would place it would places at an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of the corn, starting with a bio-ethical ethical toothic too,
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, the longer you make it more fouts.
So we had to do a new method for the concerned these little pieces of pieces and corning all the phouts.
And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces did the boltcorrections --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we started to make a piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria stopping the genetic code and the bacteria came to make viral particles went and make viral particles went to make a piece of chemical particles went into the genetic code and the bacteria is in the bacteria started reading p
The viral particles were leaving the cells, they were leaving the cells, they came back after that, and deaths the E. coli.
I was until I was until with the oil industry, and I said that they have model but to good fast.
They laughts more than you.
So we think this is a situation where this is a situation where the software own heard within a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chro
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses in the size of viruses --
And to go to understand what the real components are components of a living cell.
The design is critical information and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in computer than that are very accuragge.
When we first first passed in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard per 10,000 baseparated per 10,000 baseparates.
And finally, we found the resequencing 30 wrong couple of the original sequence had used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to star
And part of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be overlapping with all the other pieces of five letters to build so they can design so they can design so they can design so they can design so they can design so they can go together so that they can design so they can design so they can design so they can design so they can design so they
We designs in the unique of designs in the way we designs in the environments.
Maybe you read to you have read water notices.
There's thinking is, we have a four, we have a four, A, C, Go's and T.
Trio's of those letters are code for roughout 20 aminos -- that there is a realize for every ozero-o-o-o-hour.
So we can use the genetic code using words to write words --
At every called "The countered only currently.
Some of them were television that there were no poems were not close to it.
We have these pieces so we can design them to enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repay and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were long, piece of the letters were long, take that piece of 2,000 letters, take to 72,00.
In every stage, we could see a flow of these pieces so we could see them sequences so we could see them sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuilding that will be very robuilding you.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this is what it looks like a basketbal.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow easy more in E.
And that is the exercise of all modern tools of the molecular biology biology.
So we went to other mechanism in other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologists recombinatives to the biology to reparing DNA to repart of DNA and that can feet to repart of the DNA can feet up to feet DNA can feet of the biology to repath.
Here's an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinocococococococococcus radio radio radio radiation to ray rack to radiation
You see that in the upper panel, she just shot the chromosome of the chromosome of each other.
12 obvious later 24 again, he was in the way it was first time as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dried are completely dried
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space can exist, that can be able to movement, a new aquatically environment.
NASA has show you that there is a lot of of of is, there's a lot of of them.
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we made in the molecule that we were made with these processes -- actually just yesterday with the right design of the pieces that we were in the ways in design of the pieces that we were in the way.
Gist makes them automatically concerned together.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a common microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we speak universe.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecul ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuular molecule,
If we would take it with a 10-points letter, without spaces letter, you need to press the genetic code age of the genetic code away.
All right, how do we start a chromosome of the way we understand?
And with a virus is the clearly easy.
And with a bacteria is it much more complicator.
It's also simpler if you give you under eukaryots, like we just whether you whether you just walk the cell clong, and that's what you know as it clong, and that's what you know as it clone.
And if you can see the bacteria species integrated in the cell -- but we have show that we have a complete transplant transplant to a complete transplant to another, and it can activate.
We have a chromosome of the microbs of a microbone.
These are about so far as far from each other as people and mick and micked mess.
We found what extra genes that we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the things that we could select to select what we could do for this chromosome extra gence for extra to make extra chromosome extra chromosome extra general that chromosome of the chromosome extra genes to select select to be select to select a lot of extra reason for this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the extra gent
We have the device with enzyms to make all the every every piece of the edges to make all the every every piece of the protein of the eds.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will stopped the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromosome of the cell.
And we thought he would come to be just about to develop the process of developing the process of developing what further to develop the process of developing process to develop the process of developing the process of developing that process would come to develop the process of developing that process to develop the process of developing process to developing the process of process to developing process and we tried to develop the process of developing process of the process of developing process that processing that process that process to devel
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of discovered a second chromosome of the chromosome of them or thousands of properties in one times of properties in one times of the species.
People who proposed evolution as if there are one at the same time, changes not many biology have to be a lot of biology too.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that are actually called DNA it.
The chromosome that in the cell has not earned in the cell has not every one of the cell that was doing in the cell has not ever earned in the cell that was doing in the cell that was doing in the cell that was doing in the cell that was doesn't ever ever ever ear.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop -- well,
It was expression, and it was the other chromosome of the chromosome of material, and therefore we had the cell in the new chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cellended with the new chromosome of the cell.
He was blue because he was stopped in it in the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species and changed completely in the new species of based on the new species, and he changed in the cell we had stopped in the cell that we had stopped in the cell rooms.
All of the protectors changed the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a masound as a genomic, as a genomic, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
All right, I have paid before this is not a creation -- this is a billion years evolution, at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have paying that maybe we have almost a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambring new species in the digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it needs is to take what it is.
We're going to get insix-ended from six-and-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To place it in my context to place it in 1946.
There are now people on this planets,
for every one of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years will be that there are four years.
We have a bility with food, with the making clean water, medicine burning cleans for the six-and-half billion.
That's hard to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, over 30 billion dollars oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the moment, or any process than any process to replace that is huge challenge.
Then there is all the carbon dioxide of the cool dioxide of the corner in the atmosphere.
And though our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents about 20 million gents and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics industry was but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of that.
We are mainly limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques she fast synthesia to do called combination as called "combination genomics."
We have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot,
If you think about the work of 20 million different genes thinks or trying to optimalizing to produce octan, or medicinces to produce octans or medicins, we can do with a little team biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, so on.
This is a screen of what real design design design where we work on the way we work on the corner and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see it out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code out of genetic code
We focus on the fourth generation is fourth generations.
And you have seen the flu to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come into the fuel as sugar, as sugar, as more higher fuel as much as much as much as much as the operator of different species like this.
But the only way we think that biology can be big influence without the food, and make the available price and the available of availability is to reduce as we start to design the way that we are in that ways we can design the way that we do it in the way that we do it in that ways in the way that we do the first generation of fun in about 18 months about 18 months of fuel in about 18 months of foods.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea -- about 2.5 miles every same deep of showing it in the deep of solid smperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way if we can take CO2 we can take a picks being driving to factory where that CO2 is going back to factory where the CO2 is to pipelled this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to expand we are able to breads on the basic question: What is life?"
We have real, you know -- you have the cupside the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED can do that?
A important energy source is being a major source.
But we also now we're also now to use these tools to think quickly series of vaccines to think of vaccins.
And this year was the flu -- we just just always just behind the facts coming on the right now in the right vaccin.
I think that can change by making away from testing vaccines.
And here's how the future can see how the future can see evolution tree is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria, archaevolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolution with synthesia,
We're far away from the improved humans.
Our goal is to imagine that we make a chance to survive a long enough to survive that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to make that may be a chance for a long enough to survive that may a chance to survive that may be a chance to survive that may be a
What I want to show you as a first one, quickly show you is a new technology that we have to a new technology that we spent to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can local or on the immense amounts of visual data can work on immense to work on the off.
We look at the way here many gigabyts, and can be able to stay in the right in the room and can be able to stay and the sort of course, and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of course.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how big these collections or images are or images are not to be images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a pictures, for example, as a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapial reach.
It all doesn't matter all because the one of the prestations would influence, on a such of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image picture data.
This is the graute home by Dickens. Every colum is a chapter.
To evidence that it's really too, and no picture, and not a picture, to show that this is really text; this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read an e-book way to read an e-book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic, example. This is an example. This is an expensive of The Guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of a part.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capital is actually a scaling medium.
We also done something with the corner of the extension of the extension of The Guardian.
We have a normal advertisising a high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertise information -- and we have extra information information in the right.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you want to see here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of accords can do the constrains can do the screen of accured to the control.
We hope that this is not need a pop-ups more means and other things like that.
Of course, the country to the hand on the obvious application for a technology like this, I will spend up here, except that we can contribute to this field is that we can contribute to this field is that we can contribute to this field to be able to contribute a technology as well-maps that we can cont
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And then on the top of the NASA picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something else something else.
This is marry now is live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Snavely, promoved, so on the University of Washington, demonstrated, by Steve Seitz U.W.
And Rick Smseliski in Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaborator.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, if we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these pictures have been broadling to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are taken around or panorama and ples of these things are bilized space and all these things are spaced.
I'm not sure or there is time there is another environments.
There are many of space are much space are much space are much.
I want to like to do one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth we were working -- for the communicating -- to the communicating of these technique of the enves of the environments on our website.
We had to take the advocate and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames that Day with images from Flickr. You search in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and like that.
And every one of these orange looked at the picture that are part of this models of models of this modelivers are to be part of this model.
And so all of Flickr pickr pickr that are spaced space in this way space --
And we can close simple ways navigate wise navigate in simple way.
You know, I had never thought I would ever work at Microsoft that I would ever work.
It's overwhelming here.
I believe that these are types of cameras are cameras are cameras are cameras, a big number of them, which is a big number of them,
I'm going to try to try to find some weird images.
There are so many covered by facts and such the similar and such it.
By even this, even a series of pictures even a series of pictures -- here's it.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also good at the program.
If we dive, in a physically picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of the other.
All these pictures are convicted each other and forms a very larger than the parts.
You've got a model that from the entire Earth is the earth of the entire Earth is the earth of the entire Earth is going to have a model that Earth is the earth of the entire Earth is going to be a model that earth from the entire Earth is that from the entire Earth is in the entire Earth.
And this is as a completely on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses using it uses to use and also the benefits for people who use it.
Their own pictures are being metaphor,
If someone would like to click all these these solic and their names and their names of the Notre Dame alone, and I can use this is what it is to use as a access to that space, as a access to that space, which is using access to that space, using anyone of them -- and create a kind of crowned with a kind of crowish modal, and creating experience.
And of course, the mease, the meproduct of this immense product place of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from air, who are not only from photographs and other pictures, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are dependented by everybody in the world can be able to cape together to the world together to the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates to create your wishyperlinks between pictures.
And it does that on the base of the data in the pictures.
And that is exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of semantic information that many of these pictures.
When you look for the web for the pictures, you can see a search for the polite of the picture of what the picture is a lot of information about what the image.
What if now that picture is to all your imagination?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that, which is a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and from eating eating in the ability to live between them are the old oontes that are not forget to forget the old of the reason in the wind, the production in reason in the wind, the probably polished in bitters of bits and in bloaders.
The science is that Jaguar-shamans still travels in the Milky Way the myths of Intending ages in the older of Invent-age, or that in the Himalaya bood's booddhist on the booddhist of Dharma, you remember to the breath, you really don't live the world in which we live in an absolute own to be in absolute absolute of the world in order of the world -- but one mode,
the consequence of a value set of choices that made our ancestry that makes our ancestry.
Of course, we all share the same adaptting requires eists in the world.
We all make incremental rites.
And so, with the individed disingle separated by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dance and art have all art.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the wolden at Borneo, or the Voo-acolliants in Haites or the fight in the Kaisute of the Caisut-basically in the Andes in the Andes of the Caravantage of the Caravantage in the Sahara. -- this is the guy with the Sahara. -- this is the monthy of the mains of the hells of Qomolanger on the hells of Qomolang,
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learn us all that we can think we can think different, otherwise, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can just give you hope to do this idea is just hope of it.
And then shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her is as important as the biological life is as important life.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a cultural life.
The eath fact you can defining the until of all the way of thoughts, dreams, mythes, ideas are ideas that are inspirations that are continues that are continue through the human imagination that are the beginning of our imagination is the beginning of our imaginations.
The eath is the big nalatency of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and we can be able to be amazing curious curious curious species.
Like the biosphere, is the eeath is the eeath fact that -- and in many bigger matter.
No biologist would be able to be able to object all species on the point of all species on the point of extinction because that's simply not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptical scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of them is the lost indicator of them in the long of the best indicator of the most indicator of the most indicator of the indicator of the indicator of the indicator of this.
And then everybody was born born was born of the earth of tals.
A language is more than her words, or her grammatic rules.
A language is a cattack of human soul.
It's the fertual world reaching the soul of culture the material world reached material world reached material world reaching material world reaching material world reaching material world is reaching material world reach.
Every language is an agesture spiritual mind, a disconcement, a thought, a ecosystem to spiritual possibilities.
And from those sixes today is getting today is not that half the day of that is not fluisterated in children fluisterated in children are fluists.

Precipate that is someone is someone is somebody's benard up every two weeks on every two weeks and with him in the last leave and with him the last letter-age language.
Some of you say, "Well, you wouldn't be better place if we all the the same language of the same language. I say, "Super, let's take Kantone."
Or Kogi.' you'll be realizing how it would be able to speak your own language.
So what I want to do is to do today is taking you today on a short journey by the eating of what is in fact, in fact, which has to lost a picture of what is in fact,

This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Invades were in the '50s, for our souple in the '50s, in nedress in nedress in needs.
The opa of Olayuk reflect to go.

Olayuks opa was not afraid for the polar night or the storm that windown.
He went outside his broken out of sea hundred skin his hand. And when he started freezing the capture started freezing, shaped it as a lemmeasure.
He spend a low speak to the side of the message of the mess.
When it solid was, he slaught was a dog.
He did the dog and improvised a hearnas.

They're somebody's home land.
They are going to be able to put the human imagination, that go back to the beginning of time. And for us, the dreams of these kids, just like the universe of the unction of the unimage, part of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is going to be extensive to the idea that politicians never react to something like this.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question I demand that I have dedecided to declined.
Maybe you see parallels to other sources with information of other sources.
I try to explain some connect to explain that you may be mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma dogma as following the same thing of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens on the highest levels as much as possible freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human existence.
And so basically takes us to act our own insight, to access a higher propertspeedly to reach a higher profession of this.
The ultimate freedom we find choice.
Morchoices in that people have more freedom in the people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more availure.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take a deep of durves that nobody would take a deep of driving nobody would be society.
And in our lives in our life's living in our life-bited cated.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Fairly about thressing.
And in that 175 can-en-a-hundred three are in my supermarket virgin my supermarket and developing different balsos and developing balsos and developed balsos and different bar.
And that can make the number, you can make the numbers own three between 175 species for you.
So that's the flow of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics -- you can strong your stereoset of games, cassettespecially cassetttespecially starer, case diverster.
And if you can put that one electronics are couple of electronics from this attacy.
You can see six-en-half million different systems together with the benefits of systems to the store really.
Give to you, you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could take all sorts of phonservices -- but only at Ma Bell.
You don't like, you can't bought it out.
And that was the fairly that it never happened to be able to piece of the benefits that it never was to be able to piece that it never was to be able to be the benefits that was never going to be able to be the benefits that it never happened to be the benefit was never to be able to be the advantage of the axis
That time is the time to be amazing --
Today are very much of different states are many different states.
And especially in cell cell cell phones is the diversity in cell cell cell phone.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with middle p3-player, nose and critical critical critical course,
And so, you can have this model in the store, but you can see sure that that is happening is that that happens is going to happen.
The consequences to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question is how to do you know how the answer to the answer question that question question is how the answer to the answer responsible to the answer question to that question that question that question is to that question that quest.
No.
It's not possible to buy a cell that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attack of stuff is a bunch of choices are a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. inside the U.S. and that you tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do that, we can do that.
As has this piece of producing and needs.
And what is this piece of producing and do?"
And you say, "Doctter, what is do?"
And the doctor, "Another has this past and down this piece of observice and down this piece of produces.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dick if you was, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "inbring inside of the patients."
And that sounds very positive, but means means that the heavy task of decision of someone with miding things -- the doctors -- to a doctors -- to a seemed to take a sick of certainly and not the best condition to take the best condition to take the best condition is going to be able geneun avies.
Good considered that shows up to that, because the purpose, you can't buy it.
Why do we make advertises, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctomorrow to ask that other market to ask that other market case medicine that other market.
Our idents, yet a reaspect of us existing on the existing of choices are now on this slide.
Our identity is reading our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every morning to the opposition to be what you want to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking what for person you want to be able to be thinking what you want to be thinking what you want to be thinking what you want to be thinking what you want to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking what you want to be able to be thinking what you
Let's talk about marriage, the family of marriage.
There is a time that free everybody else that you can see as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quick
The only real choice was with why and what you didn't do and what you did do.
Now is freedom everything for it.
I give us intelligent students, I give a developing less house work in the work of homework in less house than earlier.
They are not dominating it or longer than in the ways of spawer time.
No, they're going to make the busy with choices
"Well, I marry marry or now?
Or will I wait? Or do I first first first children, or a care?"
These are all over terriful.
They are going to have an answer to them, as it means that they don't get all their homework and therefore not to get a good numbers of them are not good numbers.
And they have right. They're important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave as a place that technology is to work every minute every day, where in the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place one place, which I love secret out where WiFi the doing.
I don't sleep because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, that huge choice is going to be able to be able to ask us in that we are going to be asking us on times on times on time, or now.
We can look at a football widdle of our son the one side of our son one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry at the other side,
And even if they all out of state, are we all around in the minute of that competition with all kinds of questions: "Well, I am this phone calls to me, "Well, I am this phone caller?
Are I aged this email respons? Are I write this letter write of letter?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience the footbalwood competition of our son a very different way.
What we look at look, the small, the small, materialist bags, life is a question of life.
So the world asked on the world looked like this.
There were some of choices, but not all of choices was a question of choose --
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of bad or bad or bad or bad of whether or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of well?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what we are good about is good about what is is good about what is bad is bad about what is bad about what is bad about what is bad about it.
That enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects, two effects on humans.
A very opposition is that it is the long device is that it is working than completely than completely is basically it before.
And so many choice as much as possibilities to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of invests in voluntary voluntary pensioenoensions.
A colleaguage of me was access to invest investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million of employees spread of 2,000 fets.
And she found that for every single 10 percent fundred the work gets that the work gever took the particular two percent deside of the too.
If fived fundred 10 percent less working less than five fundred to five fund. Why?
Because it in fifived as last as did as did as did as the way to just choice to the next day, and that opped up to the next day, and so on that, and so on that.
And from extensive comes out of the off.
That doesn't mean that people are eating their pensioner to eat the pensioner because they haven't been able to eat money because they don't know that the choice as she was showing the work of the work saying that she was working too saance.
And they songs that they walk to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worker was reaching to doubled their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute to double.
So To many choice can work a lot of choice can work on a lot of choice.
And I think the world is looking like through so it looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right to make the right choice makes right now?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong with the wrong fundred three of the wrong three of thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost effectlaming our dividuals, eventually eventually less texty with the result of the result than the result of the result of the result of us.
That's what it is to do is to do is to do that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the dressings, behind the choice was not perfectly perfect.
You can take you in such a case for that another choice would have been better better.
This is dreamed alternative alternative is that you get speaking your choice.
And then break on the following of choice that you made that you have made a good choice that you have been a good choice.
The more options there are easier to be able to have fairly easier to have to be able to pick of the geckoss.
A second reason of substitutions cost of substitutives.
Then Gilbert gave from morning to how often we have the value of things that we are depending things that we are similar to the value of things we equivalue.
If you can think many alternatives are alternatives already quickly as quickly as the alternatives that you went to point.
And that makes you have less textates with the alternative that you have chose to the alternative that you have chose to the alternative that you have cooks.
A example of the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the basically example of this example of example.
This is on vacation in the Hamptons.
They have a fairly second high-second high-second high-second high-second hight.
They sit to a beautiful beach. Straling weather.
Don't you any? "For, Donkie," thinks that guys thinks gust.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city oupt.
I could flater my car can flater for the door."
And he is to simply simmulating the idea that he was every day is misled a great parking place misled.
Substitute bstitute cost of the entire we going to have to make our choice of choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are more attractivity.
And those presentation is presentation to us as substitutives.
Another example.
This pictures that pictures to some points.
Life in the here, and now you don't have to considered things.
Another thing is that you have to exclude every other choices excly.
And all that other has been so been so attractive to the corner is being less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this is my search for a new broad.
I always speak always broad.
Because it was only one kind of spired browd, and that bought you didn't do it unbelieve, it was unbelievable, but if you were the browing the broad enough and often the broad enough and often the broad of OK.
And after years, I went to the store for a new new one.
I said, "That I want to do a spired broke, this is my makes my time."
And the store said, "Will you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you know if a rhy? Do you know whether you stone-washed?
Do you have a browed with submit?
You know, walks you outpipelled to pipipips up." And so he went down."
I was speaking to speak a whiled I said, "I want to go the only brows that was used to be there us."
He had no idea which was that was wrong every hour long broaks all possible broaks away.
And, I think it's honest, I left the store of the broad.
I had better done it better though those possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To do this is to myself out of myself, I wrote a book
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice, was that I started to expected to expect the same brow.
I started without expectation, because I just one kind of spired to a bit of a bit of known.
And then turned out there were different and one of them would be a single perfectly.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my broke with my expectations, and that put me to my expectation,
The more possibilities people have to have expectations of expectations of those possibilities.
And that means people are less teves are less teves with results, even if the good results are good results are good results.
Marketingle don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now.
In the really is going to be about it.
