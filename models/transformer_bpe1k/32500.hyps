And showed this two showing these two slide of the polar cape cap, which is the last three million years that was about the size of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent currents.
But this distributes the worst of this specific problem because it shows not the disection of the ice.
The ice capacity is on the North Pole, in a way, heart of our global heart system.
It put out in the winter and crack in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what the last 25 years old.
The permanency is dived in pretty in red.
As you can see it from the dark bluew.
That's the yearal side ice ice ice ice ice ice in the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years or older or older is almost like blood, that is almost like blood, that is almost like this.
In 25 years of this is going to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen around the Northern Iceless warms and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon frozen carbon is frozen carbon microbes in methane.
And so, compared with the total amount of universe in the atmosphere, would double that amount of the countains if we write the count of the course point of the course of the course of atmosphere.
In some understanding in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey winter Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another understand more.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be that they will be able to be
An saving a reason for that, this is that this huge "warmtesources from the north.
This is a smelling aterriver.
The water volume is bigger, the water than ever ever bigger.
This is the Kangergerly, river, river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because it is the land mely is the place where it comes in the sea.
These streams are taking flights.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the Earth.
And last months scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance balance balance balance balance balance balance balance balance that all continent now is a negative ice balance balance balance that the whole continent continent now that the whole continent continent now of
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, is a very quickly on the fast, with some subjects.
The whole continent is for six meters of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the ones two after greatest ice masses are now new now that were new now that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is going to get half of the drinkwater of that melits age of that smelt age of the global population is going to get half of the global population of the world's dpopulation of the global population is going to half the world's population of the global population is going to get half the global population of the world's population.
In the Andes, this gler the source of drinking water for this city.
There's more streams.
But when they disappeared, disappears it also drinking water.
In California reduction of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read them, the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dreams of the dramatic stye of forest fires of forest fires.
And the number of nature, of course, all the world is supply and never seeing one speeds.
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intention.
If you look at the atches of a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 24 hours of CO2 hours.
25 miles every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, from America, and the Indian subcontinent, there's a dragh of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big causes of the warming of the Earth, which is burned to 20 percent believes of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and voice is the most most of the problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extension of the two largest stoters, with China.
And there was a lot of more urban stretty building more urble cuttes.
But we see a currence.
These are the voice carbon that the building was the building was in the last years, and where green alternatives were presentations.
There's a political battle on the country.
The cool carbon and oil industire gave 250 million dollars to promotile clean cumber carbon of clean.
And that image me to think about something like that.
And Rond the current was at home in Tennessee, four billion literal cool moded galler model.
You probably have seen the news are probably in the news.
This is the ones of one after the largest directly in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the urban lindue around the Kerstrive was done thing.
Video: "Frosty the voice carbon the stice, smally, smally, set up guy --
He's a fairly consider here in America, and he he's going to be able to growing our economy.
Frosty the voice chose man becomes with the day.
He's paying and cutble and circulated, and circulate."
And here's a big part of the voice in West Virginia from the room of West Virginia from the day.
The biggest mine per of the land is the big bage of Massey Coal.
Video: Thon Blankk: "Let me be clearly Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reme, Harry Reme, they don't know what they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of them.
Fideo COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatence for our things.
That's why the reason why the most important goal is to give a giant goal is to give a giant to the light and the realizes of the light and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of truth.
Fit is not a bit is not smary.
We think it's clean clean clean, and it smells another lead.
So, you don't make sure about climate change.
Let that only us about it.
Video: Acure cur: Schone carbon a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cities.
Fantastic! The machines making machines what lawy.
But that's the sound of sound of clean urban clean technology.
Actually, the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact of the most important causes of the Earth, is changing the Earth, changes the remarkable clean art clean area of the Earth,
Look at around this is the clean urrently clean area day.
Al Gore: Al Gore: Plesive alternative alternative alternative with the challenges and that at the area of national security of national security.
Video: America wrong crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security crisis.
The red wire is the wire of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pole colls, like polating oil.
But now there is a durfelt of solution to get this.
And the 100 percent clean electricity, within 100 percent clean electricity, within 100 percent clean electricity, within 100 percent clean electricity, within 100 percent clean electricity, within 100 percent clean electricity, within 100 percent clean
A plan to get America to get America plan that is a plan that safer makes us and warming the opposition of the Earth's Earth's heat.
Eventually, a solution that enough to solve our problems on our problems.
Repower America. Otclear closed.
Al Gore: And the latter.
Video: It's going to be America. It's going to give America.
One of the fastest ways of making an endary of old view of old view of the old of old fuels that our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help seed.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then 22: New investments to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic to be realist.
Al Gore: There's an old African ancient talks to say, "If you want to be a fast.
If you want to go far far, you know, a bit of that,
We have to go far far and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduced over the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here's the ones that I ever had anything that there were not the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever suppossible in the course,
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion a billion second of a billion times a billion times a billion times a second million times a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times
Enorm ambitious ambit!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter 22 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in a considered so you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That made that careful for a party chair.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all the way around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC with a piece of the LHC C, and pieces in the detector of the LHC in detector of the LHC in the detector of the LHC and with a piece of the first particle that is photograph of the first particle that are in the LHC HC HC and with the piece of the HCCC. Car, and photograph circle that are in the LHCHC to the detectter, and with a ph of the HCCCCCCoin, and I was going on, and was going to be fies, and sace CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCar, and was th, and ctor, and
In other words, when we had this photograph 10 September we knew that the machine worked, which is a huge works, which is a huge worked.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest or this, or then, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden writics.
And those behaviors 13 thousand ample of ample when the machine on full power to the power.
The engineers are going to say, "Not where: "Not where. It's too small carrie."
They can do that because they are superceive on all temperature of temperaturs.
So at the mix of 271 degrees, colder than the stars, that can dragged between the stars, that can drager down.
In one of the connection between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was the wire of that warmer, and there was something that was there were electrical resistance against that 13 thousand ample of ample that is a thousand ample of electrical resistance that was something that was done of the wirelectrical restance that was a thousand against electrical restance that was there were a three of electrical restance that was there were a thousand electrical result of electric restric restric retric retric reagainst of electrical resource of the puly re, and age of electrical resourcult of electrical reampietric resource was something that was something to age of electrical reampies.
This was the results.
This is still inpressure, if you realize that magnets magnets more than 20 tons of the ton and they were moved about 30 centimeters.
We have a sature about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of them, what we did do.
We all have them to have them all repaird.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We will be able to put it again, and we expect measurements in Juni, so that we can go further with the except of the universe of the universe
Now, of course, of course, that have the debate of the value of science the value. It's easy research. It's easy to research the value.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to go further, the value of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I suspect the value of the value experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is the last last of human spirit of the human spirit of the human mind of human mind of the human mind of the human mind that we are in the completely that our experiments are completely world that we are completely defenough the world that designing the designing the design
Thank you.
I would like to start with you to ask to the questions to your childhood and when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to go to ground, and they were picked up and conscious problems of the problems of learn with the and deal with the side of space relationships.
Rumultiply insight, because with the understand with the world to understand us.
If an information information of information with the nurture of physical interaction with objects -- with my advisure Pattion and my mediculture, Jeee Pattion and my computer Jeee Kalanithi -- what if we would use a computer of that engave engave engage of that one mouse of digital fingerating a plature that information that information moves would information with a plature finger five finger fish of information that we could figursue figurpostive to the information that information that information that information that information that information that movital intervitation that information of fulation that information fulation fected information that information of figursus would be able to figurpos
and can and orders as we want?
This question that question that we decided to look at a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort collapse is a Sift-grandanding computer size computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be moving with the hand they can be moved to make them movement and their movement and they detect a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade, as blocks, they can be moved by understand through it through it.
And burthy Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulating digital information.
By the way these tools have a more physical different of their movement and even have been movement of their movement and even of the way we have a movement and even of the way we moved them, there are different new and fun interactions of the way we like.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is in the Sift is to show a video celebrating a video county and othersice played and others played played --
These interactive portraits are of awareness.
Indiensive next to each other, they will be interesting.
And if they are surrounded it and they can do this and can be able to do some sense.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interaction, as it was a color, as it was a color as it was a color was a color was a color, as it was a color of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction, which was a sources of the interaction, the using of the interaction, the using of the interaction, which was a col
In this example three Siftables airs for a long and I can use them to go color in a leg in a purpose, where they are getting myself.
And if we have threw today, we go back what we go back and go back.
There's some clear clear to the education, mainly games with languages with language, mathematics and logics where people want to give things fast, and the outcome to be infected to be infected to be instance.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a simple programmative.
And here we show you a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every single letter to get every Siftable, and shaped the words are controlled in a dictionary book.
And after about 30 second it is reshaped to be rebreak a new series of series of letters with incredible possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some of children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I low them to try them to make it it out to make it out of it.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost no instructions that people nearly nearly needs.
Everything you have to say "Make word" and they know exactly what they have to do.
Here are some other people on the test of them.
That's our young business testing, right-typical trip.
And it seems that he says the Siftables wish to stack it.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting painting shown here.
We wanted to learn a platform for learn to learn of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift with that characters characters of the table.
Here he shows the sun comes up here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of David Merrill: No much brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done dan! Yeah! Yeah!
By in the shape of Siftables and the next to place the characters of the characters -- Video: Wal!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end,
and he decided how it walks and he decides.
Video: The cat flying aircle to fly
DM: the last example that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have evolved recent that we developed recent that we developed records like the lead, bass and pressing pressons and pressed the pressure and pressure
One has any four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are impacted so that you can determine the pattern itself.
You place a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leg Sift of a light of live controlabable, and filter.
They're advanced to a sound and advanced by cance.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: ThM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern of a pattern by an extra lead.
Now I place the basline.
Video: ThM: Now I feed a little bit slagwork.
Video: And I courage the filter on the drums, so that I can infect live the effect live on the effect live in the effect live in the effect live on the effect of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: ThM: I can accelerate the office of the ob.
Video: That's what I couple the filter on the basaxis for what more expression.
Video: There I can recognize the pattern here.
And so I don't have to planned everything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And finally the dims of the dims of the volume Sift to the volume Sift to the left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion from making new people-computer interfaces that are straight now that are still interfaces that our brains are still and works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of design area of opportunities that we develop the developing of the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the aid to a whole new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
Thank you from heart.
I look at it to you all with you and talk to you all with you.
I'm writing.
Books writing write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long for for a long time, and I don't think that that will change it.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, and career, which I think my relationship my work with my work on with my work on my work on with my work on and career.
And it started with a book that I wrote understanding of a memoire: "Ets, Biddy, Biddy, Biddy, that very opposed to my earlier work the world and a international existence the whole world and an international populational exist.
The consequences that people are now and always at all the time, as if I put down all the time.
OK, what -- you know, doom!
People come to me and ask me and ask sure you to be able to concerned this success is never full to be evalues?
You don't like you to stay your whole your whole life will keep your whole life will be published to be what people will be able to go to the warm of warm that people will be walk to hear heat?
You don't you afraid there?"
And you know, reason the top, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be a teengineering 20 years ago -- I was when I was a tener -- if I told that I wanted to be write.
People said, "When don't you afraid you will never get success you're going to get success of you?
Don't you afraid for deal, that you will go on through it down?
And you don't afraid that your life on this work without of this work without that there is something from coming out of your broken drown dreams of your broken dreams of broken broken with your bitters of bitter?
And once in that stretting.
In the shortly comes my answers on that questions questions on this questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called the things that are called
Always of the ways of it.
But I'm also many other things that you don't want to know that all of the things that all of it.
For seedly individual things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that that fear from, where that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically that somebody is too afraid to the work that somebody they put to their opinion on Earth?
What's so particularly so except that we make sure that we make sure that we make sure the effects of it on the minmind of the mindness, something that is not happened in the other species.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he has been asked in the 40 years that he has been in the four.
And so he said, "You're the chemistry blockade?"
No, it didn't be talked about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been through the centuries, also they didn't have the reputation of manicians for manicians to be manicians to be fair fair fair of manic.
And that close that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputting mental human beings are instability.
Look at the grim of the grim of the most magnificent creative spire of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by their own to do this.
And even those those those who are no suicide murdering under their gave in.
In the last interview for his death, Norman Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty what to say about your life work.
But of these kinds of question we don't look at anymore.
We've all heard it all earlier, and have it all hold with a home accepted all hold it all hone.
The heard thought is that creativity that creativity is that creativity is going to lead with suffering that an artist, and that a artist, will lead to the equivalent standard of the same experience of the subject.
And so I want to do everybody here today, anybody to be with that idea can you with that idea of like,
You have you found that OK?
Because I think about it now I think about it now I think about it doesn't all the way the way the way I think of it.
I think of representation.
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see this century that this century is that this century.
We can creative spire a lot of better to live better.
I know sure that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous life.
Make the fase where my career now in my career now is now in.
Go only after: I'm young, amper a fixed year.
I can may be a four decades.
And home probably will be what I'll now have seen now is going to be seen as the world as the world that extraordinary successful.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can foccurred out there, probably my biggest success all behind me.
Jemice, what a idea!
If you are so thinking about that, you're going to be nine to the nein the morning to the board right hours to the box.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me a lot of the work that I love with the work I love.
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I have come to conclusion that I can only go to write if I build a psychological protection in the process.
I have to create a safe distance safe distance between me, and my overwhole of my conceptions on my future for the reactions on my future publications.
I have been looking at ways of doing the last year, to ways to ways that thing.
I have been down in the history and have floved me in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative percent of the creative percent of creative percent of creative percent of the creations of creative percent of the creations of the
My quartery has been bread with me with the old Greeks and Romein.
Let because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romein's time of the old Gree's believably people did that creativity was from themselves.
Men believe that creativity was a gone was a gone of the mind of a practice place to the human being to humans to humans and unknoble read.
The Greeks call these are these tremendous mind these creativity, "demonen."
OK, Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that he had a discontinue.
The Romeines had a kind of a species.
And in them him was a called a geniused to creative spirit was a genius.
The funny is that Romeines with a genius,
In their policy was a geniused to be a kind of magical entities that are operated in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the household.
And if the artist of the artist was the genius.
And in the work of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first earlier, the psychological protection to the outcome of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work on his work.
The artist was in protection to protection to the against for example.
If you brilliant brilliant there.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible genius,
Well, you know, you get out of the work of you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inhands.
Long time is that the Westn creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed everything.
There's a whole new idea: the individual human is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attended from the godden world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity, that creativity was completely from the individual.
And for the first time in history was the first time in history of artists were not that they had a geniused and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big wrong.
And to one person, one person, one person, one individual individual that he or she's fating the course of the century of the century of the century of the century, of everything that good is good to be a lot of responsibility for a fragility for a good thing to a frager fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks somebody asking.
Egos are blows to huge proportions and there are incredible expectly incredible high expectations and expresent to the purpossible of prestations and put until of the same of the area of expectations and there are universe to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high-expect proporti
And I think this pressure the last 500 years many artists has made a lot of artist state.
And if that's so what that, and I think, and I think, "What what now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back the older of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
And I think about 500 years rational humanism didn't make it understanding in a 18 minutes,
Probably there are in the audience people who have reversary scientific double about the idea that elimfully creatures with what feeding plower the work of artist of artists to inspiring artists of artists
It doesn't seem to get me to get you all get to get you all together.
I wonder it wonder the wonder.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought would we need that thought tot?
And it would be so much as much as much as all other explanations of the totally crazy understandinguishment that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit has a little bit of creates -- so in fact -- so in fact that the creative process here -- you know, that the creative process is not always rational process is always that the creative period.
That sometimes almost paranoral attacks.
I have a recently understand the great American Ruth Stone meet meet meet
She's going to be in the next. Her whole life all life they have closed.
She told me about her jeuice on the platounand of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field of work on the country.
It was, so said that they were so saying a big wave air came air came to be air and lack up with it.
There was a poem wave than the land to her the country to her.
And she felt that the ground, and she felt that the shake was just to do that point that time at that point to the time that is only one thing to state her life.
And she wireless home, backyped by the poem and she had to see a lot of paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper showing the piece.
When the poem when the poem was that her only came to write it was that her only her ones to write it.
Sometimes she was not fast.
Then running and running them, but the course, it doesn't
And in the moments of the poem close by her it, looking for fields, looking for a fields, looking for a different direction.
And also there were one to be -- this is the most most most of the story of the story -- that they have the poem of the poem -- that they have the poem almost mist.
And then she was in looking at home and paper and paper it poem though.
Juist that point that moment she had a pencil of pence.
And with her other hand, so told me she poetry, she poem from the air.
And she picked up the poem at the tail, and put it back in her body, as she wrote the back written down.
In those cases the poem came up in that cases around the paper -- but then we follow in the follow.
When I heard that, I thought -- what happens to be able to do it my creative percent of creative process of the creative percent of the creative process.
This is my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a micyself, which every day on the same time, and standing with blood, sweating with blood, sweating and trans it through gates and trans.
But even in that daily heard that daily I've had one of experience that experience.
You will also know the itself, that feeling that feeling that feeling that creative ideas in your broiders from a source that you can identificate.
What is that then that four?
How can we use the without without that we are down?
On a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I have a musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the this.
And in fact, a big part of his life have been part of his life was showing of the amazing artists that tried to get all the power of all power to the unition the unition of the unition that indivaable creative in.
With the years was Tom a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the years was a little bit of the years was a little bit of the years was a little bit of the years was a little bit of the years was Tom was the years of the years.
On a day he was in Los Angeles on the fast, and changed it changed it radical.
While he was there, he heard a fragmental of a meloddy.
The decided him, like inspiration that is does inspiration that is incredible --
It was a nice nice and he wanted to be the showing hold.
But it didn't be the one.
He had no paper too, no taper-tany paper at its way.
The great exciting exciting excited to be again, "I wind the melody and then it stays me it wrong.
I'm not good enough me, I can't do it."
He did not real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry heard you can't see that I behind the home?"
"Do you really want to write a song of the song of the song?
If you really want to get this song is that song of the song as I have time for you.
That's not, somebody else did somebody else difficult --
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohent." And from that point of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the same unkill undertoon.
But the heavy of the engy of the creative percent of him purpose to the create of the genius.
The genion was close to the skin and like, and like, but only only only only close to the skin and like.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizard collaboration between a kind of conversation between Tom and the ower that was not really fully from Tom was that not all the way from Tom was a wonderful.
That story has changed my way of works.
I've been having a lot of agree.
I was middle in the writing of Eten, Biddle in the middle of Eten, Biddy.
On a given point of moment I have in despair.

Euws ago to the North African desert people to get together to dance with months to move with Molid music.
One and hours and hours and hours to the morning comes around and hours.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very smally, very single thing happened.
One of those dancers were transcendent.
You know what I mean what I mean with that, you know, you have ever seen that you have seen a performer.
It was like the time still and the dance of the time and the dance of the path stack of a patsist.

June Cohen: Ole Ole Ol.
You know, I have a few of these projects, and what it can do about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what it can mean, and the discoveries of new sets of genes.
We actually start from a new point, we were actually going to be the digitalize biology on the digitalize of the digital code to a new fase in biology to a new fase in biology designs and synthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's lik?" And what is something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand on different levels of the different level.
We tried different approaches of the approach, the back to minimum components.
We're almost 20 years of the digitalize of digitions.
When we sequence, when we sequenced, it went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask the question: can we live to create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome of a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory --
And we tried to look at if we can get a smaller genome to be able to be able to come in.
We can go into the order of hundred generate generate from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simple to the onze.
May ever me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the very unlikely that this would be a likely that this would be a likely cell likelid.
We decided that the only prevalue prevalue to synthetic so that we could have this chromosome of the components so that we could dedicate the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions also, "Can we have a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic als?"
Now, the chemistry that this very large molecules that we never seed?
And, if we start that, can be a chromosoom """""
A chromosome of chromosome of chemical inercise is that a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of the digitalize of life is accelerating on exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code of writing out of the genetic code.
And our last point would be at this point would place at an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago, we started with this thing.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ts' ethical astonish of the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard to be hard to be hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be hard to be a very hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to the synthesis very hard to be very hard to be a very hard synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the syn
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that small pieces DNA letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, the more you can make more mistake, the more of them are there.
So we had to do a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and the corning of all pieces and the corner of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt of the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, did the wrong correctorrectorrectorrectorrecting.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting particles in the bacteria piece of chemical stopping the genetic code and reading vironments and make viral particles -- and make viral particles
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they were cells, they were doing after that, after that, after that, and death the E. coli.
I was a long with the oil industry with the oil industrial industrial and that they were all too good sness.
They laughing more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software own hardware own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes, so that we could viruses the cassetts, so that we could varies.
to go to understand what the deal components of a living cell cell of a living.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer that has to be very digital information in the computer that has to be very accurate.
When we first put this genome together this genome was the standard of the standard of 10,000 baseparal per 10,000 basepars.
And eventually, we found after resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had used the original sequence was used to start on the state was not to start on the state of the business.
And part of the design is the design is the design of pieces that have to defence 50 letters that have to deal with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build designs that we have to design so that they can go so that they can be designs together so that they can go so be able to design so that they can go together so they can go to design so that they can be able to de
We designs in the unique parts of them.
Maybe you have read to stop water notices that we put water in stop.
There's a four-letter genetic code: A, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trio's of those letters of code for back 20 aminos-clears -- that there is a only lettery clear.
So we can use the genetic code to write words on the words, sense of thoughts.
And in the cure of signs we only have a moment.
Some of those were countriesed that there were no poets were not poems.
We have designed these pieces of the pieces of the enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long, and you have piece of 24,000 letters and you've got 24,000 letter, take to 72,000 letters, to 72,000.
In every stage, we have a continue of these pieces so that we could sequences of sequences because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will straky be very robust -- that will strake.
We try to reach the point of automatization --
So this looks like a basketbal.
Once we come up to the really large pieces -- more than 1000,000 bases -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
That is the experience of all modern tools of modern modern of the molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We had a mechanism that "homologism that "homology to repath, that is used by the biology to repaDNA to repairs together a bit can feed a piece.
Here is one example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococococococococococococococcus that three million rad radiods.
And that sees you see in the top panel, she was just clearly clear.
12 later, he put it back on the again, he was the again, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that around thousands of organisms that around thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that around thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely operated being completely dried
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can find moved in space, that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has shows shows that there's a lot of it, there's a lot of them.
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually used with these processes -- actually only yesterday mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did them.
Great is that they automatically collect together.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we transformed only to the purpose.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would have the printing with a 10-points letter, without spations, there's 142 pages only to pressures the genetic code of the genetic code equival.
Good, how do we start a chromosphere? How do we activated it?
With a virus is clearly easily.
With a bacteria is much complicated.
It's also simpleer if you put under the cell of the cell aryots, like we just whether you just whether you have the cell cell and that's what you know if it's all you know.
And in the bacteria species of the chromosphere, but we have showed that we have a full transplong that we have a full transplantation of a chromosome of a cell transplant to a different, and activate.
We have a chromosome of the chromosphere.
These are about so far of each other as people and mouse as people and mousand mouss.
We add some extra little bit of the such that we could have this chromosome.
We have the reflect with enzymes to make all the protein all of the protect of the protein of the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very avanced graphical images here, went to value -- the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought that he would come to be only to develop the process what furthers further.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of them or a third somewhere they three of thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who have propossible as if there are one of the same thing that changes have done a lot of biology comes to a lot of biology.
There are enzyms who are restriction enzymes that actually DNA real restriction of DNA
The chromosome that in the cell that was not early there.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop -- well, well, well,
It was expressed, and it recognized the other chromosome of chromosome of material, and therefore it only the cell of the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop them.
And in a very short time disappeared, and changed all the characteristics of one species, and changed the new species, and software that we had stop in the cell of the new software that we had stopped in the cell of the new software of the new software.
All the path of changed changed the genetic code -- when we read the genetic codepensive was the precise of the change.
This may sound as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental --
All I have been paying earlier before this is not a creation -- this is probaborn on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camble explosion of the Camble explosion of design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it looks at what it is.
We're going to be able to go from six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To place it in my context to put it in 1946.
There's three people on this planets.
for each of us that in 1946; within 40 years that will be four years that there are four years.
We have a little bit of food, with the clean water, medicine, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel, and a half billion.
That's a difficult to do that for nine nine in.
We use five billion colle, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we take biological processes in the momence or which is to replace that we have a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And though all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronence of the electronship.
We have mainly reconstrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques faster faster synthesize synthesize that called "combination genomics."
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put 20 million different genes of genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octan, or drugs to produce octan, we can produce with a small team biology than we can do with a small molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select for life vatability, chemical or fuel, chemical production, vaccine, vaccine, and so on.
This is a dismafication of what real design software where we work on the computer that we can go to the geget, and a new kind of the way that can design a new kind of design on the computer.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We focus on fourth generation now fourth generation of fuels.
One of you have seen the ground of the ethanol of the bad of experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come inside of the fuels that will come in, as sugar, to more higher fuels like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food price without the food price is higher and the availability is to reduce with CO2 as we are food supply with CO2 as his food supply design that we can design the first fourth generation of fuel of fuel of fun in.
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described described in 1996.
It lives in the deepth, about 2.5 miles of miles floor, shot temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to factories, where that CO2 is becoming back to fuel this process.
So in a brief of time we think we think we are in a brief of the breads on the basic question, "What's lik?"
We have actually been actually replace -- have the crossed to replace the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where?
A important energy source become a major
But we also are also using these tools to use these tools to think faster vaccines of these tools.
This year was the flu was the flu was always just something behind the facts of the real.
I think that can change that change from the combined vaccines of the vaccine.
And here you see how the future can see how the future can see the future of evolution tree now is going to change with synthetic bacteria, archaea, archaea, archaech and eventually ployota.
We're still removed from the improvement.
Our goal is to supposed that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that may be able to do that may be a long enough to do that.
What I want to show you a first showing a new technology that we have to show you a new technology that we have to a consider to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedar. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment that you can put local up with immense amounts of visual data can work data can work data.
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can be able to stay in the way, and example, and example, and example, and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and transformed to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at these collections or images are images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixle completely completely reach.
It doesn't all of the things that it would be influence, in a little bit of the pixels on a system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graum of Dickens. Every colum is a head-piece.
To prove that it's actually drawing that it's actually drawing; and not imagine, we can do something like this is really a picture.
Maybe this is a little book a little book.
I wouldn't recomment.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a subject of the underpath of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine or a newspaper, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertised from high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra information information information information information information of the path resolutely information -- much higher than a normal advertisist of advertising a nep.
If you want to see the possibilities, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas that can really make sure that we can do the limitations of across the screen through the screen.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more means and other flaure.
Of course, the country to put a hand map on a technology like this, I won't contribute here, except that we can contribute this field that we can contributed this field of a technology as well.
These are all the weaks in the U.S.
And on the top, on the picture,
Let's look at something different.
This is marries now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision of the University of Washington the University of Washington University of Washington, defined by Steve Seitz on U.Washington U.Washington, and the other is a very beautiful piece of them from the University of Washington and other is a very nick of it of Washington the University of Washington on the other is a little bit of
and Rick Smyseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made the impossible made by Seadragon.
When we do this, if we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer-vision algorithms have these images together to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashws or panorama and panorama and panorama and all these things are space are spaces.
I don't know sure or there's time there, other curvatements.
There are more of space there are more of space.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a question of Photosynth, and this is a question of Photosynththat we are working -- to the communicating of these techniques are what I have in my head of the environments on our website.
We had to hold with the advoces and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dage with imagins from Flickr. You can just just just this Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and so on.
And each of these orange chain the pictures give you a part of this model of the purpose of this model of the ear.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are passociated in this way space that are space in this way of course.
And we can be on simple on simple wise navigerate.
I had never thought I had thought I would ever work with Microsoft would work on Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is so designed to be so much to be so much to be so capitary here.
I believe you can see that these many typick: everything from good to mirror mirror to mirror mirror of mirror in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much more discovered by factions and so so much like that.
There's a series of pictures are even a series of photos -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also goodged by the program.
If we dive through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the whole of the other, the Earth of it looks at each other.
All these pictures are resisted with each other, and shapes a very bigger than the single of the parts.
You've got a model that from the whole Earth.
And so, this as a completely on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when it uses are also growing the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being a bit of meta-data that somebody else somebody else or ferts.
When somebody would like anybody anybody and their names and their names and their names and their names, my photograph of the Notre Dame up with all those data, and I can use as a access to that metaph, using using the metaph, which metaph, using of everybody else, and creating some kind of crumultiplace of these kinds of social experience.
And of course, the axy product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from air photographs, satellites and other applications is directly, but also from the collective and other approacts.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all images that are part by everybody on the world can be particularly buying everybody on the world can be able to copp?
BA: Yeah. What this is really does discovered.
The creates to your wish wish between images between images.
And the data basis of the data in the image.
And that is designing when you think about the riches of semantic information that is semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you go to the web looks for the web and you figure a quarter, and the text on the webpage of the purpose of what the image of the image of what the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image, you figure the piece of the images, you figure out the pictures, and the text of the purpose of the pursue of the picture, and the text of the webpage of the ina lot of information about what the picture.
What if you put that image of your image is on all your imagination?
Then the number of the understanding semantic connects and the amount of wealth that comes from the amount of wealthy that comes from the classical networkfect.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure and nographic research is the possibility to live between they're not forgetting the old communities that are not feel early feel in the wind, the reason in regard polished in blow.
The science that Jaguar-shamans are still pretty galaxy galaxies, or that the myths of Instead, or that the myths of Instead, or that in the Himalaya boodhist on the boodhood of Dharma, remember you really live in the world of Dharma, you remember, the world in which we live in a absolute of the world is not a bsolute of the world is not a model of the world of the world of working of the world of the world of the ready of the way of the world --
And the consequences of a set of set choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all sharing the same adaptable: Worn born born of children in the world.
We all make increasingly introduce rhything.
Ome with the individed of the death,
So it can't be surprise that we all have sings, dance and art them.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that is about the Penan in the walk of Borneo, or the Voo-Di, or the Voo-bators in the Kaisut-batching in the Kaisut-bary batching in the Andes-burgan Andes-burn in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- whether with the wells of the well-month, a month, or now month, or now a month,
Everest, the Godin-mother mother of the world.
They are all of us to learn us all different, otherwise can think of us, otherwise can be able to orient orience.
If you think about it, this idea can only give this idea only hope.
And together the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the planet and for her biosphere.
This cultural lifesweb you can imagine as a eeating front of eating this.
The eetrun you can defines the defines of all the minutes of all the thought of all the minds, mythes, mythes, inspirations and intuitions that are basically intuitions that are the beginning of our conscious imagination of our conscious
The eetnosphere is the big nalatenship of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all that we can be able and already that we can be amazing news amazing directly species.
Not like the biosphere is the eating fact is the eath fact that is -- and still in much bigger mate.
No biologist would be a biologist that minist at least half of all species on the point of extinction is not true.
And right, the most apocalyptic scenario comes doesn't even come in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss.
And then everybody here was born born born on Earth's sousand languages.
A language is more than her words, or her grammmatic rules.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the buried of the sicl of every unique culture the material world is reaching the material world
Every language is an an old mind mind a separation, a separation, a thought, a minute spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand language today is that half of the day of children fluist.
They're not going to be babied babied of babied babies.
Effective means that unless they're a change of change, that they were dead.
Is there something that is a little bit of the aid of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, and the last ast your language of the ancestors of the children or the rewards?
And Presisted that is somebody's legacy state every two weeks of the earth, because every two weeks die.
Some of you say, "Well, the world are not a better place if we all would be the same language would be speak?" I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba of the same language.
Or Kogi." you're realize how to be able to talk about how it would not be your own language.
So what I want to do is take you today is taking on a short journey by the eath noshowing that has to be lost of what is lost of what is lost in fact,
Many of us forgetting that when I talk about "another way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being a different way of being us,

One of the fascinating tribes that I have left the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a remain 1958 performance contact was contact of the fascine.
In 1957, five missionarians contact failing missionary failing missionary.
And the sky they pictures of themselves from themselves with our idea's idea's friendly butttings that this volution has never seen a second dimensional image of themselves.
They were trying to find the photographs and tried to find the face behind the face behind the face behind the face.
When they found nothing they found concluded that the divel of them are ried with this, after the missionaries, and after the missionaries.
But the Waorani continue doesn't only extension of the other.
Fiftile percent of their mortality came from their mortalities.

One continent is always to be religion to leave that Africa are bending on the Sahara did no religious believe. Of course they had this well.
Foodoo is simply the destillased of this device of religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora at diaspora at the tragic diaspora at the slavery.
And what is the foodoo interesting is the living and the living and the death.
The living bars barred the minds.
The minds can be touches of the Great Water, answers to the dance of the dance of the dance of the living time, so that during the soul of the living time, so that during one that one is the follow of the follow of of the follow.
That's why you say foodominating this, "You are going to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God," and because you're so purposes of the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a blurrent showing showing the pace that purpossible glowing collapses are basically glowing colors.
This is a true demonstrates the ability of the mind to influence the mind to influence when this is this is in extreme extreme is what this is in extreme is that is extreme is that what is is in extreme is the possibility of the mind to be the body is extreme to influence the body of the mind to the body, of the mind to influence the body,
And from all the volves that I have left with the Kogi, are the Kogi, the Kogi, a pull from the north of Colombia.

"See? It's like I said you've got to say you.
That's how beautiful is to protect this is to protect myself the older brothers.
And I think of them are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And in this point is the intuition is the intuition is very important.
And if we think of indiculations and landscape, we lovate to Rousu seau and the old fability of the epartical wanted to be a idea that racistic in his simplicits of the edge.
Or we get them and say that these closer close to the Earth,
Indicurse people's nor of sentimental ingular.
For both is very little space in the malaria moerass of the Asmat or in the icses of the Asmat or in the icsey winds of Tibet. Desalenineering a traditional mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical myself is based on the idea of subtleft that the Earth, because the idea is conscious of the surface can be existencird on the idea lot of the Earth, because of the conscious subtant.
What does that mean? It means a small child from the Andes, which is grown with the belief that the mountain Apu-minished that is going to lead and a different relationship will be a fundamental other person will be different and a difference that will have a small child from Montana, the idea that the mountain that the mountain of the idea that the mountain of the idea pile that will be a little child of the countage of the way that will be a little child of child of child of chargest of child of choice that place that place that place of the way that place of the ches will be a chargestape of the place of the place of the place of the course of the crain.
Or it the lives of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
And interesting is the metaphor that the individual defines the individual and natural of natural world.
I grew up in the forest of British Columbia with the idea that these forest forest these forests were going to be able to be able to become a caps.
And that made me another people's friends of the Kwagulth, who believe that those forest forest that those forest forest the lives of the Hemel Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromm Snavel of the Hemel and the Kord's office and the Kroms of the world are around of the world of the world are of the well.
These mind are important at their Hamatsaineer Hamatsained.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can be able to get the idea that these cultures start to get a number of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant.
It's a picture I justice. in the North Amazon nam.
This is aya-huasca, the most powerful psychoactive active company of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaxhuascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of it, but how it is built it is. It's built from two sources.
Enervous one does like, a lot of that better carboline, harmaline and harmaline in the area and hallucinating works.
If you only take the plant of it seems that a blue walm by your awareness.
The plant is mixed with blower from a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of psychotric fridis.
The plant tryptass powerful tryptamines, which is brain dimethyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine.
Do you ever see the Yanomami as they seen that snuful, which substance of different species that are also several species that are also fat?
That is a nose to be a break of a being shot of a being shot with barokages to country to country to country to a sea of electricity. This is not distribution of the reality.
I tried to my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince a man who discovered the psychedelic age of the psychard in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify the hallucinated as hallucinated because when it is the effect intreated is increasing the hallucination. Tryptamines are not oral oral in the human darks, because they are not oral org, because they are designed by a human dark in the human darmouth of the human darmer oxida.
They can only be oral oral to be ingenomists with something that the monoamine of the samine of the samine,
The fascinating is that the basic carbolines in the lide monoffed monoamine-suppressers to activate the tryptamine, the tryptamine, you can follow this question of 80,000 plants, which are fological disinated species are two morfological varies, which is a biochemical varied of the bigger is that the part bigner than the parts of the sharing of the parts of the parts of the sharing of the benefort of the trypiefine is of the trance of the trybody of the bends of the benoke of the bolchars of the benoice of the trypiefron
We say eupistic "trial and there's a trial and that is being designs are being desigsker.
The Indians say: "The plants talk to us," "The plants that means data Deayahuman variants of ayahuman varians of ayahuge distance of ayahuge distance of ayage distance that would be in our eyes would be a species.
If you bring their taxonomy in map their taxonomy in card say, "I thought you knew something of plants were going to knew something of plants were whatever it was plants to knew something of plants that knew something of plants were going to knew something of plants say, "I thought to be able to knew something of plants are saying, "Well, "I thought their taxonomy of plants that they were able to knew what they knew to kill, say, "Well, ""Well, I through plants you knew something of plants you knew something of plants of plants you kobtools ket their take their taxonomy kes kes kes ks.
You know who's all legs?" I said "no."
And it turns out you can see all the 17 species in a full moon in a full moon in different totally in different totally singles.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of boot boot than meels countors.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is even under us that sympathy at the sympathy of indicately and color, they're seeing color, but tool, reduced to a foot-needle in the history as the real world, increase the real world, means that are the real world.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years to be not remembered to be war or his war or technological innovations, but earlier as the age of the age of the age of biological and active of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always part of a dance with new life of life as possibilities.
Technology on its is also the problem.
The Sious indians are not Sious to be Sious, when they gave their pile, when they pick their pile, as well, as well-Americans are stopped Americans and ways their horse and ways way.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eater threat. It's powere.
The crowd face of the government of the government.
Where you look at the world are also notice that it's not going to notice that it is not the locks.
These are dynamic living people, whose existence is being dynamed by identifieable forces that are forces that are forces that are forward their adaptable.
Or this is going to be the enormous designs in the Penan, a nomadic South Asian east, which is a nomast-generation that is living and now reality and now reduced with the distbarnment and now prostitution and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see the rivers of Borneo South Asian South Asian Zearea South of Borneo Chinese Zuid-fular South where Japproach,
to fill their creates from the board stams of the forest bits of the forest bream of the forest bombs of their ships.
In the Yanomami are the disease of the Yanomami are done as a result of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of the gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetter mountain, where I do a lot of research of political government that is the wread of political government.
Genocide, the physical exception of a volt universal real, but each notion of the destruction of life is not only not just convalence, but it's not just in a lot of areas part of a development, but is in many areas part of an development.
The pain of Tibet is not to contained the basic level level, until you get on the basic level level.
I agree with a young colleague about 9,000 miles about country of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa was in Lhasa came back in Lhasa where you heard about the statistics that you heard about it.
6,000 Hold monuments destroy monuments in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis that he was done was the Chinese was started the Chinese was started the Chinese invasy start.
His unclean flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which people to in Nepal broads.
His mother mother was prison because she was rich rich --
He was the prisoner's basically smoky when he was two -- he was breakthrough her rock.
The sister that was so frigured in a foodingsmoky camp stopped in a foot camp.
On a day per unfortune on a poorband of Mao. For this poorband of them seven years of desperated for seven years ago.
The pain of Tibet can be undred increase the free of the people's fresh of the volvessels of the people.
And finally it comes up to a choice.
Do we have a groundness of once or want to live a color?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she was standing that we direction that we direction that we have a general means moved that we have a general means moved --
We would not only the human imagination are limited to a smal, model, model, but we would have to wake and forgetting it and forgets that there are other options of existence.
We can feel our nederstand the idea that our species are about [150,0000] years on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our land that we gave our far, when we gave on the cults of the seed, when the poetry was replace of the prieiests and a shot of the priests of the priest of the prieiest of the priew of the priests of the piece of 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history doesn't give me the idea that we have all the answers of all the answers of all the answers that will come the next millennia on our path.
And if the intelable cultures of the world to be humans are asked to humans are being humans are being with 10,000 different vots.
And it's in that song that we will figure the possibility to be discovering what we are, a folbeing a full species, which is a full species and all the gardens of the gardens. There are great. There's great moments of optimism.
This photograph I have on the northern of Baffin Island genomen, when I went with Instead, when I went with Instead.
This man, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inter. In the 1950s, they were in the 1950s, they were going to be place.
The opera of Olayuk refle.
The family of peace for his life and untools him already was already tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inside not bang for the color; they made it use.
The glist ice ick icrows were taking fish from fish in charibooks.
Olayuke was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that wireless window.
He went out his break of sea small of sea small of skin his hands. And then he was freezing the poon started freezing, shaped it as a limme.
He brought a lot of speak on the side of the side of the message of the message.
And when it solid was, he slaught a dog.
He did dishe's dog, and improvised a harnas.
And from the ribbenkast he made a bast.
He was looking at a dog, and disappeared about the ice flate, including pools.
Over with nothing about nothing comes around with nothing that is in many up, symbol for the weather state of the In's and all the indicates of the Inst, and all the indicatelebrates in the world.
In the april 1999, the Canadian government government the Infrom a full bigger than California and Texas a bigger than California and Texas the new this. It's new through Nunavut.
It's independent area. They are area. They are all the groundstoff.
It's a completely example of how a national example of how a national enough to be able to off.
And finally, I think it's clearly the clearly at least for who to these upset of the world is tool, that they actually didn't really far away from the world is not far away to be far away to be far away to the world
They're somebody's home country.
They're going to be the beginning of human imagination, which is going back to the begin of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, just as that part of the unse, part of a bit of hope.
And what we do in the end of the idea that polic, is extended to the idea that politicians never reached it.
We think that passociated -- we think that a polet of purpose -- but we believe that stories are the world that can change the world that is probably the world, we probably the world's best of the world, we are in 156 countries a month, we are in 156 countries on TV and in 156 countries on public,
We make a lot of travice to the eath noshift with our public cultural places, where the researal cultural places, where the ways the way that he is so interested by what he looks ks so hopefully the most important opening of the anthropology will go into the world that this world the reart of the way to live in a multiplure and in a multiplure of life and plure plure and in a multiplure plure of the way to like, and plure plure and in a way to live plure of life and plure and to livicitiefront of life of life and in a way to live plain a way to livalistt of life plorigure
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom can contributtribute us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some of the questions that I have a book,
Maybe you can see parallels with information from other sources.
I have a little bit of the amazing that you may be commistent.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Wester's industrialized society.
And that official dogma light of the same speaks, for the profession of our citizens on the highest level, we have to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good cleans a great part of the human existence.
And basically freedom is able to act our own insight, to act a higher wonderful sight, to reach a higher profits without inment.
The ultimate freedom freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more profound.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take a society would take a bit of this.
And in our life is this dogma bit of breakdogma bit of breaks.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about thressings.
And in that 175 can-five can-tools are in my supermarket and different market virgin my supermarket and developing different balsamicoil and different balsamicol and development.
And that you can do that the number of the case own dressings own drive, between that are nothing to do with the 175 species of you nothing about it.
So that's the purpose of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can see your stereoset of stroneoset of the stroneoset cors, cassetttespecier, cassetttespecially diverster.
And that one electronics one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can see six-and-half million different systems with subjects of the store of that story.
Give to -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could call the kinds of phonservices services are all of the phonservices of the policy of the Bell.
You don't hours it still state. You don't bought it.
That was the fairly that it had never been to be able to piece of it.
That time.
Today there are a lot of different states.
And the cell phones is the diversity is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mes-player, nose crer and crer and crer crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer cruser and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer cr
And I mean, you have a model in the store of the store that is that you can make sure that that that happens is going to happen.
The consequences people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer on that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do it.
And also in aspects of life that are more important than the point of stuff that are more important than the choices of choices are a fact.
Gealth health care -- it's in the U.S. is in the U.S. is not so that you go to the doctor, and that you tells you what you need to do.
No, you're going to the doctor, and it says, "We can do A can do whether we can do that.
A has this forma, and deals.
And what do you do?"
And you says, "Doctter, what finds you?"
And the doctor, "Am has this piece of these piece, and then Tots, and detths.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Docter, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And that is what we call the own incredible of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means a bit of decision that the heavy of decision of somebody with business -- the doctor, somebody who has a view of certainly and it's not the best condition has been sure to get decisions -- the patient. For recept of recepts.
Good scared that ners, that ners, because the purpossible group, you can't buy them.
Why do they make advertises, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to call our doctorrow our doctorrow to ask that other brand medicine.
Our identity, yet showing us existency of our existence, is now consider the choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is going to be able to get our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it.
Every morning at the morning you have to think what for person you want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that that you have been a while automatically from that you would have so fast as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as
The only real choice was with whether and what you follow doesn't do when and what you did do.
Now a free of all for the open for the open.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I developing less homework less house work less househomework on the same homework on the homework of intelligent students, I would have developed 20,
They are not domicide or lout, in the ways of the time.
No, they have pressure with choices makes a lot of choices.
"Well, I say married or now?
Or I'll go to wait? Or I first children, or a career or a career or a career rese?"
These are all the way terms of these are all set of the questions.
They are going to answer, if this means have been an answered that they don't get all their homework on and therefore no good circle of the corrects.
And they have equipment. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just that technology is to work. Carl us, every minute of every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except of every day.
There's a marrow place, which I think WiFi it does.
I don't mean because I want to stop that because I want to keep the place for me.
But any good choice of work key choice in that we wonder to work on the time we wonder whether we're going to work on or now.
We can look at a footbalwidely look at the one side of our son the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the other side, and maybe our laptop of the objectbalwood on
And even if they all get out of standing every minute of that competition of the competition with all kinds of question?
With-mailt responds? Well, I write this letter?"
And even if the answer, "Ne" is, we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
Where we look at that, the small, the smally, the small, lifestyle: lifestyle: lifestyle: lifestyle.
And so the world was asked the world looked like this.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of choice.
And so the world looks now looks like.
The question is now. Is this good or bad or bad or bad of whether this well?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what's good about what's good on it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on human beings.
A very opposition effect is that the earlier is lower than basically basically basically than a bit of before.
And with so much choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigatic example of investigations in free plans.
A colleaguard of me to invest access to invest data of of of Vanguard, a big polish society with about 2,000 feet of a million work-basically spread 2,000 statements.
And she found that for every desire of the policy fundred the work-several two percent of the particular two percent of the tributes two percent of the purpose.
In fifth fifth of five percent less percent less than funds. Why?
Because it with fified is so difficult to choose that people are just extend to the next day, and that people are still up, and that opened that, and so on.
And from the objectory comes from the objects.
That doesn't mean that those people after their pensioner pensioner dream because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money knowledge that the choice of knowledge that they were working on the work-too.
And that they walked up to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose for the nose of their nose
The workage was a named to contribute their own contribute their own contribute.
So a lot of choice can worse lots of choice can work on the freedom of choice can worse a lot of choice can worse too much choice can worse a lot of choice can worse a lot of choice that can worse a lot of choice can worse a lot of choice freedom in frone.
And I think the world that the world is so looking like this.
If it goes to be the century to make the right choice makes the right choice, right?
You don't want to be separated with the wrong funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the paralyzing, if we were lose and choose less tevel less tevel less text with the resulates of the resulates would be if we had less options as we had before.
There's any more reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, for example, back that the choice can't be perfectly perfects.
You assume in this case that would have been better.
This was dreamed alternative alternative to get the spired of your choice.
And speak on the fold of the choice of the choice that you made made that you have made a good choice.
The more options there are more options of easier to have the couple of the piece of the piese.
A second reason of the substitution.
Then Gilbert from morning to mormorch of the value of things that we have depended of the things that we can figure them.
If you can imagine many alternatives you can already already the attractives of all alternatives that you wise.
That makes you have less tevile with the alternative that you have crossed it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you're excuses.
This is a little bit of the strettiny of this example.
This is a pick on vachance in the Hamptons.
They have a well. They have a wound.
They are straight-beautiful strand. No human beautiful.
And in the way? "Fardikie," thinks that man, "It's augggan.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city.
I would have my car, my carton for the door."
And he is to simmulated two weeks, with the idea that he would every day again, a great parking space of fail.
Substitutives are going to be at the full that we have from our choice of the choice that we have a great choice.
The more possibilities, the more attractives of the alternatives are there.
And those presents, that presents us as a substitution.
Another example.
This picture, this pictures a number of points.
Life in the here, and now that you can't take things to them.
And one point is that you have a point of choices of the choices of choices is that you exclude.
And all of that other has been so much of the objects, which is less attractives less attractive.
And third is there the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this quartery was my question for a new brow.
I always wire always spired to the row.
And they used to be only one species of the speed broek, and that bought your thane. The pagest totally unbelievable, it was incredibly ununcomfortable, but if you were the break of the course of the room OKK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "There's a glet-broek, this is my make. This is my make.
And the store said, "Wilt you fit fit is fit or relaxed to be relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to be smart fit --
Do you know whether a rhyth? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a break with squee?
Wilt you have a little bit expended or flink out." And so he went down." And so he went to through it.
I was talking about it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to the only brow that was going to be the only one of the only thing that was there used to way."
He had no idea that was not a idea that was and so I've been a long all the possible broken all of the possible brows.
And I think of all, I left the store end, I let the wink with an increasing broke.
I had a better this. I had all those of those capabilities.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To do this on me, I wrote this book.
The reason I felt that I felt with all those choice, was that I started to expect more of the faster break of the fast.
I started without any expection, because I was just one species of known.
And then it turns out there were different and one of that would be a different of that would be perfectly perfectly there.
And what I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I compared my break with my break with my expectations, and that stated me me that passociated with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break exctions, and that picture.
The more opportunities people have to have more than we expect to expectations of those who are coming about the services of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevile with results, even if it's good results.
Marketingle people don't know this thing.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really about it is about it.
All of the thing was better was better of all better.
Because when everything was bad of surprising people have pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society of society of citizens have perfection perfection of the best thing we can achieve it is something so good as we had to do it.
Never before we are surprised to be surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torent.
The secret of happiness -- here's all of this -- the secret of happiness, the secret of happiness.
I want to imagine -- I want to be a carry elemental elemental -- that I am with a woman that really fantastic fantastic elebrate with a woman that really fantastic elemental elemental elemental elemental elemental element
I didn't have me with her texts.
But with less enough less enough his good cans.
And finally, why you can get a bad bad of sit bad bad cooks, if there is one kind of a private of previous bad you wonder why you're unteving.
The answer is that case, simple.
The world is responsible -- you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, and you buy buy to fall the time, and you buy that it turns out to fall the time?
The answer is just so simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break to fail.
So if people decision of those decisions of those decisions of those decisions of decision of their choice.
And they take themselves quality.
In the Western society society of the younger generations are higher generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the Western ssion under the younger generations of the Western society society squares higher the young generati
A factor -- not the only one, but a significant factor at this explosion of depression and suicide of depression and suicide is that people have so often television of their high experiences of their high experiences.
And if they try to explain that count of themselves themselves themselves the decision.
So the netoresulate is that we feel objective on presented on presentation, but our bad of this.
And for a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for everybody to be considered to be touch.
But that's not.
It doesn't a subject that can choose chose better than can't choose automatically that choice is better choice that is better.
There's a magical foundary possibilities. I don't know that.
But I know that we have been pretty for the point that choice are well-well-well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost of a principle -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best
