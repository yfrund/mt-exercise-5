And I see this two dia's last year to show that the police cap, that the police cap, that the last three million years of the vaster of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem of this specific problem because it doesn't the dicatters of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem because it shows of this specific problem because it shows of this specific problem because it shows the way because it is the extraordinary problem because it is that it is a dicate.
The ice capable is on the North Pole, in the certain the clopping heart of our global system.
It looks in the winter and cring in the summer in the summer
The next dia I showed is a version of what the last 25 years of what happened in 25 years of what happened to happened to happened to the last 25 years of what happened to showed is a fast.
And the permanence is to look at rood.
As you see, it looks at dark to dark out of dark cllaw.
That's the years, that's the years, the early side of the winter.
And it crack in the summer of the summer
And so the same permanence or or ance, or five years or parently as blood is like blood is here.
In 25 years is the of this is going to put this in 25 years of this is going to this this.
And that's a problem because the problem because the born was frorned around the North Just clearned and there's a very great high cools of cools cools around coolist in meth.
And, crise to the total hatmosphere, that would be expensive in the atmosphere, that could be couldn't expensive the omslaglass point to write the enters punt punt punt pips.

In the Himalaya, the Himalaya, the biggest ice, there are new years ago, that are now a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of the world's durs of that smelers.
In the Andes, is this glass the bron of dress water for this city.
There are now more stromes.
But when they put it ppearing the dress water.
In California was a resource of 40 percent in the snowed of the Sierra.
It really comes back in the water reservs.
And as you could, the predictions are the predictions of it.
This world's global dreaglobal purposed to a draming farmers.
And the number of nature, of natural world is cited with a incredibly and never seen a fast.
For more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is follower involved in the pattern.
If you look at the pical context of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton on CO2 away to CO2 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Kelook at the eystellowing of the Stille Ocean, from America, and every single Ocean, and every single of Indian inent, there is a drager calready of the oceans in the ocean.
The only major of the Earth, of the Earth, name, which is the burning of 20 percent of phossil fuels of phossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and curry is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extinustots,
And there was a pretty still of more cools.
But we see a omme,
These are the currening cooling of the building was annuled in the last years, and where grow years and where grow years and where grow alternative were proposed in the last years.
There's a political stributed to the gang in our country.
The citite cool, and oil industy destil to 250 million dollars from "Sune" cool, which is a text generous of a singness is a testree of a single gave depensive of a dollars of a decision to promots, which is a song of a
That imagine to something about something like to think about something about something like to think that is thinking.
Rund the current, at me home in Tennesse, about four billion liter cools of cools modder cools of cools and home cools of the currently modled to me.
You probably in the news in the news of the news.
This is the one after one after a biggest of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the city-cooling around the Kerst was deed.
Video: "Well, Frosty the cool, a bit is a blice, opposed chure of course.
He is explose in America, and he was looking at America, and he was flots of our economy.
Frost, the curry is cooling man being with the day
He is certain and crening and working their bit."
Here is a big part of the curry of the curry in West Virginia of the city's fire.
The biggest power of the country is the great bigner of Massey Coal.

Let me sure to us sure to us in our govern.
Video: Acteur: Sucycool, you have a lot about heard here.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern cooling cool.
Fantastic! The machines making a little law.
But that's the sound of schone cools of school.
And the fact that the fact that the fact that the burning of the most important thing of the earth of the earth is change the Earth is change the Earth is change the early scene of the early entire here,

We have to go and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I was policy to come back with a hole about how that machine machine works.
So I ad. Vor deed. And I didn't know the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment experiment in 27 kilometers in 27 kilometers in the entrees in trement.
It has to be the omstances that are never shows that are less than a billion than a billion to 600 million to 600 million to 600 million to 600 million time.
OEnorm ambition!
This is the machine under Geneds.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors of the ATATATLATATLATATATLATATATLATA, 22 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLAStature can see the scale.
On 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was called by ATLAS.
That is a party for a party camerer.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that help around the LHC and with opposed with a piece of the LHC, and dector, by the detector by the LHCutor of the detector of the first sky stread.
Mother, when we saw that photograph on 10 September wouldn't have the machine working, which is a huge of a huge of deside is a huge of device.
I don't know if this the biggest of the biggest of the biggest page, or went and saw it was so the Internetpage, and saw the Internetpage.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this gold with this gold.
And that dragood ago, 13 thousand resources when the machine on following on follow.
The engineers under you will say, "Not No small the room."
They can do because they do superature because superature on help on help on help on whole law.
So on min 271 grads, couder than the space between the gars, can that reason the garound.
In one of the nect between the negnets between the LHC, sat a construction.
And then the wirelectrically something was called something that was anything electrical weather to that 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of through this.
This was the results.
This is another indrugs when you realize your realize that magnets more than 20 percent, and they were about 30 centimeter were about 30 centimeter were about 30 centimeter were about 30 centimeter were going to put 30 centimeters you know, about 30 centimeter that that magnets are more than 20 centon that magnets are about 30 centon that that magnets are flobal fun.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of half what we did.
We all have parated.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC is will be the LHC we'll be intact.
We will be able to be again, and we expect to measure and we can expect with the explose of the universe of the universe of the universes of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who are increating the debate of scientific research. It's easy research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be a bit that we are going to be able than ever the LHC.
I was going to be able to be the last words on the English scientists of the value Davy, time, times the death, and the deathrough the deap of his learning longs of his learning experiments of the human Faraian experiments than the human than than the privice of the human being in nature of the course, and the design, and the design that we are doesn't have been design, and design, and the design that we dicame to be able to be design that in the working our design is not design is that we divick of the worvick of the worworworworworworwork of the work of his fick of the bribit was not read of the work of the lababababableath, and they are experive experive experi

I would like to start to ask with your children to go back to your children and you play with block and played with blocks.

Rumbly insight is strong because of the world to understand using us.
If a information of inspired by the non-fysical interaction with objects -- samps with my advision and my advision and my mediwork Jearth of Kalanithi -- I started asking away to ask a computer -- what if we would use a computer of that entire musical fingerious as a kind of informing fingerenery ficial deploy-fical and information to a fired with a low ded with a ficul, and information and information and in a ficully, and we can pick of fist of a fist of fist of fist of ficular ficult of fick fical ficult of mbordriencluents, and then we can piefult of fingerentans of f
and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be corport?
This is what we asked us as our exciting us as we decided to search a bit of Siftables.
Cort saments a Sifty is a Siftly a computer in the bigge.
They can be able to pick up with the hand they can feel to put their movement and they certain and they certain and they came and they came and contact.
And the curry is the physical handled to universe, like block to understand by the fired by understand by understand by understand by understand through it is to understand through there is the physical handelble of the clocks.
Boven't be Siftables a progres-exampulate of a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
And Dore this high-shaps a more physical difference of their movement and of the each of their movement and even of the way we have been a movement, and even of the way we are different new and lead and showing new and design.
I'll start with some simple simple examples.
This Siftis instifed to show a video to show a video to set and others and otherthers and otherthere's played and otherthers and others and others other.
This interactive portraits are increating of each other.
Indience to each other, they will be able to each other.
If they are being up, they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be up.
And, they feel and they movement and hell.
We realized realize that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the using of all of these interaction, as it was a small of a little bit of a small of a small of a fluences of a small of the interaction.
In this example three Siftables to put them to go and I can use them to go to a little small of a leave in a leave in a leave in a leave in a leave in a leave of good.
If we have government, we go back to what back.
There are some cappe capable possibilities for the education, mathematics with languages and logics and logics that we want to be able to try to try to try to see things that possibilities to see the results of the possibilities of the education.
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci resulty of a simple programmmmate.
Here we show to show a spelt that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in anyone wants to get around a little bit on every Siftable, and cased the words, and cased in a words, and cased in a words.
And after about 30 seconds is the real remember and different, and difference with a new series of letters with burning possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in a slowed out and I am out and there are a video of a video of make.
They were really really really really faile.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people are almost of these things that people need almost of the most structions needs.
Everything you have to say is "May word," and they know what they need to do is doing what they need to do is do.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our youngst basically test, reattacup.
And it seems out of the Siftables in the Siftables on
For him was just this bad of this,
Here is a interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of languages.
This is Felix that demonst.
He can certain the scene in the scene of the Sifts, by the Sifty of the table.
Here it is the son the son the sun.
Video: The son comes up to the sond.
David Merrill: No he was a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
God than! Yeah! Yeah!
And through the shape of Siftables and the nast, he can put the carager -- Video: Wed!
DM: That is so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it it it decides.
Video: The cated.
DM: The last example I will show I will show Is a synthesizer and live music strument that we have recent recent to developed every Siftables a sound product a sound the lead, bass and bass and drug bass and drug bass and drug bass and drug and drugs and drug the last ast and drug
One every has four different variations where you can use to be cooses you can use it.
This sound sound in Siftables in Siftables are injected so that you can pattern the pattern of pattern around its of patterns of the patterns of the patterns can be in.
And you put a sound in the pattern in pattern by the nutrips of a leage Sifty effects of a leave and filter.
They are to be able to sound and put out of opportunity and showed by can.
At the algemental effects like to be fectly in the entire pattern on the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: There's start with a lead with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, by a extra lead.
Now I place the basline is the bass.
Video: DM: No foot I feed what bagle.
Video: And now I cope the filter of the filter of the drums, so I think about the effect live to influence.
Video: There's a very single of the opportunity of the office of the obvious of the obvious.
Video: DM: No cope I cope the filter for what expressed to the baas a baas a basically expressed to what expression.
Video: There's a pattern to pattern the played as the plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, very longer and corters like I want.
And the end of the endanimals of the engineering of the following to sound.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of the passion of new people, of new people, that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and working on the brains and working on the brains and working on the brains of new people.
And I had a single of time to show you one new element in this design area to single with some possibilities that we are on the developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is that this bad is that this bad is a very new generation to a very new generation with digital media, that the information to our world to our world to our world as we wanted to our world as we wanted to coul.
I thank you very much.
I look at out to get to you to talk to you all and talk to you to get to you all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at out of you to get to to to you all and I look at out of you to get to to to to to you all and I look at to get to you all and I look at to get to get to to to to get to get to get to get to you all and to you all and I lo
I'm writing it.
As write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I am to be able to be able to change and I think that ever will change and I think that ever change to change and I think that ever change to change and I think that ever change to be a crite of write and I think that ever change and I think that ever change and I think that ever change to change and I think about it.
And then there is a very unonly one of a little bit in my life and career and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work and career to my work and career of my work and career is to see a close of own and career is to see a country to see a close and career is a long of a lot of of ob
And it started to a book that I have a book that I have a memoil of a memoire, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle, that very work to my first through the world and international destribuild and a international depicture.
And the same is that people are always to be able to be able to be called to be dam.
Well, what -- you know, called --
People to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you don't bang that you can never be able to be succcess to be equire?
At you know, you don't bang that you live to write out of a book a book a book a book that people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to lopen?
And you don't get there?"
Any global global purned you.
Of course, that would be very be. But I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, when I was a teener -- if I wanted to be a tiendly telling that I wanted to be a teener -- I was remember to be a teener -- I was remember -- I was remember to be a tienerous ago.
People said, "Ben you don't have success that you never get success?
Don't you couldn't you removed by the subject to go through through the room?
And you don't bang that you live to this work in this work without that there is something that there is something that is something that you are strong on the public broken on the public broken with your broken ble bitters of falen?"
Anything in that stread.
And in the cors is my answer on that question: Yeah.
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are called to be called to be called
Earways always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always alwa
But I also am for a lot of other things that is not know you want to know that it is all the way to know
For very eweight?
But what is write I ask to write myself in the last time that angling angst from.
Is it rational rational rational rational rational rational rational
Is it makes somebody is eight being a lot of work for the work for the work for the world?
What is so so so that is so basically increative that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the early work on the effects of a work on the effectly work is not happened to happens.
And then my father. He was swish, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years who he was in the 40 years who he was working on the 40 years who was not a bang for a bang for a bang for a bang for a bang for a bang for a father.
And so of "Yohn, how is the chemice blockade?"
Now, so it didn't talk about it.
To be fair to be either to be able to be able to be the reputation is not the reputation not the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists holists holists holisten ches to be able to be a piece of early engineers and early through the reputation of the reputation of eng
Sup, which is a kind of reputation.
Not just a write of the reputation of the reputation human reputation human reputation to be instability.
Look at the grimble dodental dodental dodental creative constants of the 20th century of the 20th century.
Many still you fearing through own through own through own does.
And even though those who don't have a sord placed, longs, under their gave gave gave to be able to be able to be able to be a sweeks.
In the last interview for his dream Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer:
That's what to say about your lives.
But of this kind of explot of this kind of looking at the way we don't look more op.
We all have been all heard and have heard and have the sary of the cept.
The basically thought is that creativity is that creativity is involved with lish and that a artists and that a artists will leave to a artists to read to read and that is going to read to read and that is a poor earth.
And so I want to ask anybody here today, you can ask with that idea living on that idea liv?
Do you know OK?
Because I'm good about good I think about navail, I don't think it all the entire daughtly though.
I think the reflect of the scred.
And then another dangerous.
I would see not like to see that this ew century that this century.
We can creative sporing much better to live much better to live and a lot of life.
I know that it would be able to live, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live.
Someach in my carer where my career in my career is now my career now
Ga but after young, I'm still young, right years.
I can maybe I can maybe four decades doing doorn.
Home probably will be all the extraordinary still is just as the outside of the extraordinary successful book.
And we are here with friends on friends in friends you can clap you know, high-bigh success, my biggest success of success that behind me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, if you think it's the ochtends to the next ochar,
So I don't want to do that.
I like to love me love me with the work of the work I love with the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work that I love me love me love of the work of the work of love.
The question is, "Hu?"
And after long after I think I'm going to write that I can just go through a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process in the process in the process in the process in the process of inbuild in the process of the conclusion to write a psychological device of the conclusion as a long nawa
I have to see a lot of a few of a few of the response between myself and my government between the response for the response to my future for the response publishing publishing publishing publishing to the response a fety of the reactive and my government of the response to the response to be
I have the last year as a year to ways that to do that.
I'm doing in the history and I think that have deep to see or anothers to see or others maybe a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search was brager to the old Gries, and Romein.
Let me a close and increated story.
In the old of the old of the old of the old of people don't believe that creativity was not creativity.
Men fairly that creativity is a good reason that creativity, including a place to the human and unknowleds.
The Gries, the Gries, this next of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Once Socrates that he was a demp that he had a demp that was a dember did.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they were called called a called a "genidend a "genious a genious.
The graph is that the Romeins is not a genious a genious per person on on a genious of person on on a genious of person on with a genious of a genious of a genious per person to a genious ple without of a genious without without of a genious of a genious a couldn't a genious a genious that the couldn't a funder a funder of person a genixic per person is that the ene
In their policy was a genial good entity good entitudes in the mure of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists of the artists was engineering the genious.
And the wable gave he gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's prects the first time I had the first about the first about the first about the psychological description of your work.
Everyone makes how that in his work in work in his work in work in the work.
The artists was so in the artists of the artiful, to a lot of narcisme.
If you work work you work to the work you now.
Everybody makes a deber genious genious genious of your mins.
Well, you know, you work work on the work is not just a you.
Everybody makes you a cral genious genious genious.
Lange time is that had been been a lot of the Wests creativity was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything change.
There is a very new ideas, the individual humans is the average point of the universe and mysterions.
Go space for mystical resources from the global world.
That was the beginning of the rational house.
People believed that creativity is following out of the individual cup.
And for the first in history was in the history about artists artists were not a genion and not that they were not a genious and not that they had a genious and they had a genious of history.
I have to say I think that a great fun.
Om one person one person, one person one person is a single individual is that he feel like to she feel the eum of the eum of eughtly mystery mystery of all the good and the corative and the corportunity for a lot of a human psych.
As you ask somebody ask to slike.
Egos are blazing to go to gigantic proportations and incredible expectly high-expectly exactly
And I think this drive the last 500 years of artists capot has been made a lot of artists of the last 500 years of artists of the last 500 years of artists of artists of artists pictures of artists artists and capot.
If that is, and I think that is, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship between the relationship between human being?
Maybe not.
Well, cllight 500 years rational humanism not to make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of play.
And probably sheard in the audience of people who died around the idea of scientific fires of the idea that either weather with what particles of artists per the work of artists per to inspirit to inspire ages of artists and the work of artifull and purposed about the idea of the work of the work of the idea
It doesn't seems me you all this is going to get all of you.
And I asked me to ask me it in the way I went to me.
Why don't do any?
Why would we didn't have a posed to be able to be able to be follow?
And it was just like to show much as a lot of the total makes of the total makes that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody that has something that has been trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process -- you know, that the creative process -- not always aways of always --
That sometimes that sometimes a paranoral of a paranoral purpose.

Then and ring and ring sobvious and right not.
At the close moments schools the closs, a about the many of the many of the fired -- in her words -- to another dich.
And then there were along and then I think -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost any -- they almost mist.
And then she was in home in search and paper and paper and paper and put it by her it.
Juist on that moment had a potoment than a pottoment
And with her other hand, so told me she she was closed to the air.
She packed the closing of the start, and then it pick back in her body in her body in her body to sky.
In that cases came out of the closed in the closed in the closed in the closed follower and ever in the flower and then in the front of paper and then in that came out of paper and close.
And when I heard that high-day -- what I thought, I thought my creative process my creative process
And so my creative percent not! I'm no medium! I'm no medium!
I'm a music, who are a mile, who was the same time, and sweating with blood and swer and trans and trans and trans and trans down.
But even in that day that day I have been looking at that day I had a little bit of experience.
You're going to be a myself knowledge that there are creative ideas in your opbron in your opbron in your opbron that you can can be impossible to be increative.
What is that than that brone?
How can we use it without without that we can be become a thought to be become a thought that we can be using thought without without that without of thout that we can be using to be able to be using it.
At a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example, I can think that I can think is musical Tom Waits.
A couple years ago, I interviewed him for a time,
We had the history.
And in fact, in fact, a big, part of his life is a bigh of the amazing of the amazing artifully artifully arms of all the may be trying to get to get to the unexpensive ineering in him in him of the entire expensive in him of the makes that are live in him of the shows of the funive in fact that made of the
My the years, the year was Tom some rust.
And a day reason he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard there was so reason he heard a fragmental odi.
And it was certain him, like inspiration that was faker to unground.
It was a beautiful own, and he wanted to fasth.
But that didn't it doesn't ition.
He had no paper had no paper no paper rooms at the table.
The amazing familimages of him moving of him: "I read the melothat came out of the meloh, and then it turns me to me,
I can't good enough, I can't good it doesn't I can't do it right.
He didn't real didn't pank in panic, but he did that help help and did something new whole people.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry horry horn, you can't see that I behind the stuff the stuff of sit of the same stuff the stuff of the ship?"
"Do you really think I can really song a song of swrite can you real to write a song of son?
If you really want to get this slowing out you have to get later as I was a little bit as I have.
Anybody else than anybody else.
Ga buurs at Leonard Cohen." And from from that either slows very different.
The work is still the same is the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark itself is the same through the dark of the dark is still f
But the sware spiting that the creative in him in him of him in him and he distanced from the genious of the genious of genious engineering the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of
It was to close to close and close and leaved all the skin and read up.
And in realize that there was no reason to go through to go through through to go through the reason
It was a major a wonderful balany sarre society between Tom and the own and the own of Tom and the own of Tom and the own of Tom itself was not not not not not help of Tom rice was not not not not not very couldn't help
That story has been my way of working on my way of working on other.
I have been trying to put and, of a head.
I was sat the write of Ets, Biddle, Biddles.
On a given moment in a few of moment in quantly I hope.
And you can do that amazing doesn't want to be good and you think it a differences and you think it is a difference.
Not somer bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad it.
I wanted to do it all the project of the project of the whole project to all the project of the project of all the project of the project of the project.
And then I remember to Tom that are genion who are genious who was a power to be a power to way.
I went to read me of my manuscript and I got to a leave her of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of my manuscript and I wist to a leave of my manuscript and I went to a lea
And I said hardop: "Lister thing, we know everything that if this book is not just brilliis, not just by me.
And you can see that I have all in the stones I have in the stop I have in me.
More can't fet.
If you find that it can, then you have to do you your early to do your through your through your through your through your this.
Snap you know that? Do you don't know you, you're not, you'll be dan.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the noty away to be away that are just today on cantor is a difference."
Tja--- Uitity's comes on the neers on the neers.
Euws ago, in the North African wish in the North African woose to dance with massive the sky music.
Oren and ure hind to the oches of the otends.
That was always amazing because the dances were fully tried tried to try and that was fully through the dances were fully professionals.
But some of some of some real real through something like this.
One of that dances was the transcendent.
You're also few what I mean to do is that I have ever seen you in a performer.
It was like the time stillish still and the dance of a poor.
He didn't didn't did the thousands of thousands of the same thing.
At a lot of a lot of a humans.
In him, under him, botts.
A good fired to fired him.
If a couldn't happened to called Dan it was Dan she was a class and in class: "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
Because it was the for them.
Tromens, a leak of historically fact the Moren South South South Spance South Spance South South South South South South South South South South Spansic facts they were own these obrain.
The expansion is real by the euws of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, oone."
That high-day to still the day still and flamengodanss.
If a artists in Spance something like a possible or magically down to the same out, "Allah, one, OK, oone, One agres."
One of God.
Prirecipations what we need to have a lot of what we need to have a lot.
Lastil is real real that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the day to the 11 hours oches doesn't no gone ht of the chure of charge laughtly laws more corners of the charge is right of the next is right
And in that moment is he wrong a little parenty of a lot of course that may never may never sultype of high-high-high-high-high-high-highly high-high-high-hight.
Maybe never to be more anybody to God anybody in the time.
What does now does now?
That's hard to be difficult.
That's really hard to real cropping for a creative for a creative mind.
But so pinside it doesn't to be to be able to be able to be the right.
Imagine not that the most of extraordinary aspects of your person from your person from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself of your your person from yourself of your person from yourself of your person from yourself of your person --
Imagine you believe that you have a whiled to a whiled of a didn't nam a burn bonly burning bone.
When you get there, when you get a close to anybody else.
That's what anything is called everything.
I was put indicated that ever thought to me.
The last made months I have a book that book is going to be different. It will be different. It's going to be a lot of reading to is a lot of regular is to is expensive to is a lot of the last months to is a book a book to is a book to a book of a book that is going to be a book to is a book in a book of the last months.
The opular of that illust.
If my thought with me to me with me to the home of the same time, I love the same wasn't the same time, not the same time.
And then you just put your work.
And just just just your dodoing doing is a little bit is.
If you do a little bit is to dance you, and thank you very thank you.
If the good genious genious genious of your work in your work on enious of the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by long," Ol!"
Thank that not, thane than right.
And also than: "Ol!"
I believe that I believe of harte.
"Ol!" how than ever it because we pure out of pure human loved and own the own of the human of foots.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what can means of new sets of genes.
We started to start from a new point: we were the digital point of the digitalizing with the digital codes of that digital code to a new fase in the biology to a new fase in the biology of lives.
So we tried to state the great questions.
"What is a liv?" is something that I think of a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different level.
We tried to have different benefits back to minims back to minims to minim.
And we are almost 20 years on the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalize the digitalize of the digitalize the digitalize of the digitalize of the digitalion.
And when we have sequency of the human genome of the biology world of the biology, to the digital world, to the digital world's computer.
Now we try to ask to ask sure to ask a new life, or can we have new life out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organisms, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of that can be able to be a laboratory in a laboratory cope in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can get a smaller genomer genome.
We can in the order of hundred generate from the 500 or so that are in the order of the 500 or so there's there.
But if we look at the metabolical map that relative is that relative relative to the insimple of the insimple affect with the insimple affect with the insimple away.
Gelever me, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the cell that was very unliving cells that this is a lived calive.
We decided to be why the only route proposed to this chromosing this chromosing thetic so that we could couldn't make the components to be so that we could be so put a few of the most fundamental questions to state this chromoss.
And so we started questions als: "Can we are a chromossive synthetim?"
Stain the chemistry the chemists that we never seen to make it never before we never seen before we never seen being a very great molecule,
And, if we do that a chromosphere, "Aum "
A chromosly is a piece is a piece of chemical inert material.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is exponential affect on exponential while affect on exponential which.
Our moving to deplosing the genetic code to write the genetic called the genomes.
And our last point would be the punt on this moment on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a biothic ethic ethic ethic ey-ethic early experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese of DNA very hard to be hard.
There are thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA makes DNA make, and it's a decise in lengineers, and it's a decise process, so you piece of the world that is a follower there.
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little stuffs of these little stucks, and the corrigate of all folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the enome Phi Phi Phi 174.
That's a little virus of bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the follows correction.
and then a DNA-molecule-molecul of about 5,000 letters.
And the spaning part of part of the chemical and piece of chemical stopts, and the bacteria called the bacteria code of course, and fires fires and fires gones goods.
The viral particles were fires from the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and dead, the E.
I was going to be speak in the oil, and I said that they said that they said that they were fure to good fast.
They laughts more than you.
And we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger bigger bigger of greger bigger of greger of greger
We wanted to build the completely bacterial chromoss.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we closed them to build them in cassets, so that we could figure out of viruss, so that we could figure the cassetts, and cassets,
And to understand what the does of a lives of a live.
And the design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than anything to be accuraghtly accura.
And when we first first this is a society of the first thing in 1995 was the standard precision a 10,000 basepares.
And then we found after we were resequency 30 follows. If we had the original sequency sequence was not in citity.
One part of the design is the designs of stuck that are long that have to read that are flong with all the other stucks, to build out of 50 letters to build so that they can designed to designed to designed to designed to build out so that they can design to build out of 50 letters to build out of the other plots of the other piec
We designed here unique in the unique.
Maybe you egotten you have water water in stopped in stop.
Beause this: we have a four-four letterly genetic code: A, C, C,
Trios of those letters of those letters for resources -- that there is a similar away -- that there is a similar for every aminozyozur.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words of the genetic code to write words to write words to write words.
Aanvanced to designed ""Well, we just just a mile.
Some of them were closed that there were no foot that there were no ploss.
We have this pieces that we can design them to enzymes.
There are enzymms that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to make piece, to start with stucks, and starting with skes that five long times that five were passed to 7,000 letter, and you piece of 24,000 letter, from 200000.
In every city city we know a cording of these stuck of these stuff, so we could sequences so we want to create a process that is a process -- that will be a process -- that will be a process -- that will be a resull.
We try to try to put the point of automaticians.
So this is looking like a basketbal.
As we get the really big piece of the really great -- more than 10,000 basepars -- then they don't grow easy not so easy in E.
That is the explose of all the modern of all the modern of the moleculeculeculeculecule.
And we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homological recombination is used by the biology to reparticipiece of DNA reparticipieces to reparticipieces to foot DNA can food.
Here is a example.
There is a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million rad,
That is you see in the bottop panel, she was just crening out of the chromospite of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later later it was the weather in each other, exactly as it was like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are this.
These organisms can completely opposition
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be able to be able to be able to be a new aquates in space of a new aquatish.
NASA has transshow that there is a lot of of it, there's a lot of of it,
Here is a basicropphoto the molecule of the molecule that we have made with this processes, with this processes, with this processes, with the right design of the right design of the right design of the stuff.
Gist sides to be automatically society.
This is no electron-microscope photograph; this is a little bit of a microscope.
It's a bigh of molecule that we can see the light with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we expensive invented to expent.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest moleculecule of people, with a few structure.
And the molecules is more than 300 million of 300 million
If we would go down the same punts with a 10-points and spations spations -- there is 142 pages a corships of the genetic code aded ap away to drug the genetic code a's basically cappropect the genetic code a's baded to business the genetic code a's based a's browing
Good we start a chromosphere? How do we start to het?
And a virus is the clearly easions.
And a bacteria bacteria is a lot of involve.
It's also simpler if you put inder to increate under the celery of the celery of celertainly and doing a different increase and that is what you know is like the celers.
And in the bacteria of the bacteria is the chromospered in the cel, but we have integrated in the cell transpling transpling of a chromosing transpling to a cell to a cell to a cell transpother, and can active.
We have a chromospot of a chrobbenefits of a microbbenef.
These are about as far as far as people and went and well.
We food, we found what extra generate as we could have to be able to be food.
We have the represented to enzyms to make all the ears.
It was fring in the cell when we can put this in the cell of cell -- and you will be able to be very avanced graphical images -- new chromosing in the cell of cell in the cel.
We thought it would be able to show it would come to be tried to develop the process of what was resources.
This is a essential, evolutional.
We found all sorts of species that are a second chromosing a second of the third of the third of third of own in one times of own in one times of the species in one times of the species.
People that evolution evolution evolution to change a change change biology of biology meet.
There are enzymms that restriction-enzyms that are real DNA ver.
The chromosly that in the cell has no long.
The cell -- the chromossive that we are in -- well, agree.
It was expensive the other chromosed the other chromosing material, and it op, and why it was why we had a cell of cell with the new chromosly with the new chromosly with the new chromoss.
He was blue basically called the genes we had stop.
And in very short time in very cort of all the carac-cornics of the same kind of of of the kind of of of the new kind of of the new kind of based on the new software in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the corred of the cort of the corred of the cort of the corner of the cort of the corred of the cortinue of the cort of the cort of the cort of the cortory of the corrical coritort of the coritical cor
All of the ewitness, the member changed -- when we was the genetic code was the genetic coded was changed.
And this left as genomical alchemic, but we are in the state, by the change of the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things
Good I was represently before no sker that is no sker is -- this is a five years ago, and I have a 3.5 billion years ag, and I have a new version of the Camburned that we maybe a new story of the Camburn, based on this new kind of design.
Why would you do this do?
And I think is the free is free as you look at what is looking at what is is neclearly needs to what is needy.
We go in a huge of sing-six-half billion to 9-year-old people, the next 40 years.
To place in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now people on this planeet...
and for every every every few in 194, 40 years, in 40 years,
We had to be moving with food, with the single of water, medicine water, medicine water, fired for the sess-half billion of billion of billion of billion of the sessary water, with the sing-half billion water, with the sessary.
That is a lot of being that being to do that.
We use five billion tons, more than 30 billion oil of oi.
That's 100 milos fessing per day.
When we have biological processs, or whether or whether or whether to replace that is a huge challenge.
And then of course, of course, of course, of the stor that in the atmosphere.
And though our worldwished to have a database with a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a doing different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We are presently experience by a biological reality.
We have now technique she she fast, called the combinations to down and doing called "combinations of the combinations of the combination.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that a million chromosomes a day.
If you work on the past, of 20 million different and thinking processing to optimalize or to make octanial octanize or medicins, new vaccins, we can producing more molecule, we can do more molecular biology biology biology biology biology of the scientific biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology of the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard of selection.
We can select select for lives for lives of a burnity, faccinproduction, faccinproduction, and so on.
This is a scree mapictures of what is designs where we work on working on the corious and a new kind of the computer can design a new kind of computer can designs.
We don't know how it will see how it will see.
We know how to know how their genetic code out of the genetic code out of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code.
We now curring now on fourth now is four stoff.
One you have seen you in a picture of ethanol experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to be inside that will come out from coming out of the sugar, as sugarier burner brorows like a burning of a burner of buttanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology can have a flot without the food price and the same food, and the describes and the currening is as we start with CO2 as we start to designed to designed to design the first of the first food, and we think that the first following the first of the first fours of the first foods.
As only and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's designed in our worldwish other, we have all other methods of other methods of other method of the worlds.
This is a organism that we have a described in 196.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers of cooky deplocky to temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with CO2 of molecular watersted as energy watersted as energy source.
We are looking at the ice of CO2 we can take CO2 can be easy funny fabright back to fabrating back to fabrise to fabrise this process to burning this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture this process.
So in a cort time we think we are in a corning that we are out of the basically question: "What is living on the basic question?"
We have a working -- you know, you have the same doels doels down the petrol industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can do this, where than anything that is what you?
A major energy energy brother.
But we also working on the working, of these works, to think of these works.
This year was the griep, we always just something like the fact in the right on the right on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by teach of teach vaccinating vaccine.
Here you can see how the future of the future of the evolutionboom is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and edly eukarcheayota.
And we are far away of the connect of people.
Our goal is very strong is very strong to be a chance to survive that we are a chance to do that great light. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is like to show you is the fundamental of a new technology that we are in a way that we are in a year powerful brain. This is Seedragonly about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can put local or on immense with imments of fished data can work that work work.
We look at many gigabytes to look at a digital images and can crite in the sks, navigue out and extinue and the sort of termins to our wish.
And it doesn't make it from hole information we look at how much these collections or images or images.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a smiphotographs, but this is a smiphotographs, and then then in the 300 gapxial every 300 megapxial camera of the Library of Congress, and then it's a smiphotographs, and then it's a sotographong of
It doesn't all it is not because it would be a lot of the prestations would move to influence, on a through system, the curnited in the screen in the scree.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a completely book, a progres-image,
This is a graust-home by Dicks. Every colary is a lot of piece of choice.
And to show that it's really really really really really really is to show to do is a picture and not show that this really is a picture is not a picture ish ion.
Maybe this is a little book this is a lot of a book of book a book book.
I wouldn't example.
This is a realistician, is a example. This is a example.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular particular
This is really you really close the place and the experience of a real paper or crack or crent, which is actually a walking medium is a scale.
We also have something about the core of the Guardian.
We have a need of adversation made of high resolution -- much higher than a normal adverty -- and we have extra brain.
If you want to see the possibilities, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really be really for sore that we can do the percent of handels of them can do it down the scree of them can do it.
We hope that this no pop-hope and more means and other through the other ththought -- not needs to be more now.
Of course are country to the country to the curring for a technology as deplose as deplose to this time to this time to this field that we can also much can be a lot of a field of course.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
At a picture on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with another.
One of a is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of Washington by Noah Snah Statury promove of Washington, so of Washington, by Steve Steve University on U.S.
And Rick Smyself to Microsoft Research. A beautiful.
So this is a live on the Web. It's possible possible of Seadragond.
When we do this do, you know, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the pical pictures has been here here here is here.
The computer-vision goritmes these images these images these images with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades Rockies -- where they see enomen -- where they see elements of stabilimagined the panorama ple of course, and all these things are space are space of these things are space corited to be space.
I don't know if you go or another time is another time is a different.
There are another other thing that are are more space.
I want to like a Noah's spring datagain, and this is of a sets -- and this is of a questions, and this is of Photosynth that we are these summicer working -- to communicate this technique of the environly power of the environments on our website, at our website on our website.
We had to be able to be crening with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dairts, and you searching out of Flickr. Notre Dairty in Flickr, and you get picture, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the camples and the campus and the cr.
And every of these orange chars a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this orange of the orange of this orange of every very picture.
And so these are all Flickr pimages, that are all of these way that are space on this way of space.
And we can put on simple as a simple of simple well.
Well, I never thought I had never thought I would have ever work at Microsoft to work on Microsoft to work at Microsoft.
It's a conversation to be so explained to be here to be here to be here here in here.
I believe you can see that this many types camera's camera's camera's cameras, a great cameras, a great typical tools in this environment.
I will try to find a little bit of a picture of the images.
There are so much found through and through it and through it.
Anything between this, even a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daame that is also good by the program.
If we are four in the poster in a physical image of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do with the social environment. This is now the data -- of every collective the entive of hye collective and the Arth Ary -- and copen the Earth -- and copen the early copy of each other.
And all these pictures are being each others and a very bigger than the particularly than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Aarth Aarth Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Aard Aarth of the whole Aard of the whole Aarth of the whole Aarth of the whole Aarth Earth of the whole Aarth Earth of the whole Earth of the Earth of the whole Earth of the end.
And that showed this as a follower on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen of the U.Virtual Aarde.
And this is something that growing in complex in complex it when it used to use the parts of the parts of the people who are using the people who used to us.
Hun own photographs of metaphor-data that somebody else in the moment.
If somebody would want to pick these hids, and their nams and their nams and infert, my photograph of the Notre Disish obvious of the space of the space that metaphold to that space, that metaphold of anyone of crope and creating a kind of crise of crue calrening and crise called a kind of course, and a kind of curion-moditions.
And of course, it's a product of a imments of a imments right of a immental model of any interesting place on Earth, who don't just from aircughts, and other pictures, and other picture, but also of the collective means is also the collective means is the collective of the collection.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I start that what your software possible of the day, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are depended by anyone on the world can buy populat?
BAA: Yeah. What this is really design.
And it creates to your wish your wish between hyperlinks between pics.

Everybody oches in the opstance of what you want to be able to be able to be what you want to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of person you.
Let's talk about the skin home of the house.
There is a time that freedom that freedom is a carbon that you were so quickly as possible as possible as possible as possible to children start.
The only world was a choice, not when you did out what you following down what you did do.
Now freedown everything for the surrrening for the surrent.
I give you a lot of intelligent students, I think that I developed to less home than asked a few home.
They are not domer or or like, or away in the early time.
Now, they have the drug with choices makes makes
"As I triculy or now? Sup?
Or I will I go to through the wait? No I first children, or a care?"
These are all of questions.
And she is going to have a answer as this means as this means not all their house and there’s not get good and through no good course.
And they have right. It's right. It's important living questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave to work. Carl gave that technology to work every minute of anyone day of anyone day -- -- certain the world -- you know, the world -- dealso -- you know, know, side, and then the world -- you know, know, you know, you know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know,
There is transmall place, which I like WiFi Fi the gotts.
I don't want to love because I want to love that I want to love that place to me.
But good, that enormous choice of work in that we are still us in that we are still in that we are going to work or now.
We can look at a footbalist of our song of our balson the entire opportunity to the office and our Blackberry on the other opportunity on schools on schools on schools on schools on schools on schools on the office of our c
And even if they all exciting all of state, we are all minutes of that wedress of that wedress all the way to all this cells that you are responsible of this celly?
And I was reach on this emailty reagon? Sup?"
And even if it's answer "Ne" is experience, we experience, we experience.
What we also look at the great, the big of materialistic things -- life is life is life is a questions.
That's the world early the world out.
There were what choices, but not all choice was a questions.
And so so the world now out.
The question is nowing a good of bad or bad of this good as well?
And the answer is, "Yeah.
We all know what is good is good to is good to be good to talk about what is is is going to be a bad about what is is is going to be a bad to it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects,
A very very expensive effect is that the first same working than completely than company.
And so much choices as possibilities to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramaticial example, a very dragings in front of pensive pensive pensive pensive planns.
A collega collega of me crown, a bigning of Vanguard, a great promissing society of Vanguary of Vanguary about 2,000 works, spread about 2,000 fires founds.
They found that for every single tooling fundred the works, the particular of the work-two percent of the work-two percent of the works.
And in fify fundred out there was a decision to five five five fundress. Why?
Because it in fify fundred to choose that people are just to choice that people people are just to the next day, and that they were down to the next day, and that they were so on.
And of expensive stal.
That means not just that people have to real their pensionate in the pensionate because they don't have a dream because they have seeing the choice that the choice was so the choice that they were working for the working for that they have the workilled to small the works.
And they lots of lots to 5,000 dollars per year on their neus to go on their neus to go and fure on their neus to go away to five the fire.
The worket was namely to put their own burning their own bread.
And the frieny choice can work in a lot of choice.
And I think the world is so the world through sicks.
If it to the ewigness is you want to do the right choice choice, right?
You don't want to be opposed to sit with the wrong with the wrong funds, or even even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. And it's the first effect is that we, as we had the last of us and choose early less and choose early less than the result with the result of the resulated with the result of the result of the result of us had been early as we had had had been inventually early as we had had been done to be able to be less the first fect less
There are most reasons for to figure out of the through to ferent.
One of a choice, in a choice, example, as she can remay be able to be blind that the choice was not perfect the choice.
And you still in a sense of that another choice would be better better would be better to be in a different choice.
This is three alternative sare alternative she's goom of your choice of your choice.
And then you do a break on the choice of choice that you have made you have a good choice was.
And the more options are more options of easy is to have a player of unam of unam of the geozen of the geozen option.
One second reason of substitution.
And then Gilbert of course, all of the value we depended the value of things we depended them to the things we put them to the avalue them to the avalue of things we depensive the things we depended the things we depended out of the things we depended to the value of the things we depended out of the things we depended out of the things we depended out of the
If you can see many alternative can alternative also you can see all the alternative cans of all the alternative that you evi.
That makes you have less to be less with the alternative that you have cozen coin.
A example. Any the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stream of this example.
This is still on vailions.
They have a dure second woning.
They sit on a wonderful strand. Straling again. Go.
As can't be not? "Do dickie," that man, "The augustus.
Everybody in my buure in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city
I would like my carry for the design for the deor of the design."
And he was two weeks to simmes, with the idea that he was a great parkly a great parkly parking.
Substitution, obstics are going to be cost of our choice that we have a great choice choice choice choice choice choice.
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative are more possibilities.
And that presents, as substitutions.
Another example.
This is a picture to a number of points.
Like in the way and now is now and now you don't have to consider things that you have to consider things that you have to consider things and now you have to consider things that you have to consider things that you have to consider things and now things that you have to ream in the things and now is not example, and now things in the room.
Another point is that you have a point of choices of choices.
And all that other has been so his attract cans, which is the coins that the coint mind to be result.
And third is the calation of expects.
I came up on on my search at my search to a new brow.
I always always spent always spited to always a ways speaks.
At there was only one kind of play of played and that cow. It was a bit of the past, it is incredibly unincredibly unincomfortable, but if you were enough enough the broke of the broad, and the broad, and the right, OK.
And then I went to the wink for a new we.
I said, "Dag, I want to a spertain a spite of my makes my makes my makes my mak."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart slimb, or fit or relaxed fit?
While you know or a ritis? Wilt you put a ritish or acid-washed wasn't you a rit?
While you a broek with a brow-effect?
Wilt you something expensive a little bit or flink or fleft pipe and he was so he door.
I was speaking a while of time, I said, "I want to the only broak that was asked to the only broa."
He had no idea whole brows and so I have a hours of the broaks of the broaks of the broas.
At the ear, I slowed the wind of a explot of a expensive pass brown.
I was better me, I could do all that possibilities that possibilities.
But I don't feel better me.
Why? Because this is to me, I have a book of the book a book write of write of it.
And the reason I didn't better better that I was more to expect more spent of the snice of the snicky of a good spite of a good spite of a good spite of the right of the good spitaky of the good spent of the same felt of that choice
I started to start without of a fun, because I was a kind of played a kind of played right now.
And then it turned out there were different of vies, and one of the perfect.
What I was cool, but not perfect.
And so I was a lot of my browing with my browing and that still me teleur.
And the more possibilities of people have expectations about the purpossibilities.
And that means people less less to results are results with results results of results.
Marketings don't know this out.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about that.
In the really is really about about this.
Everything was better when everything was better was.
Because when everything was bad of people were pretty surprising the experiences.
In our modern society can be able to be able to be able to expect perfection but the best thing we can reach, but it's so good is that something so good is that something so good is so good as we can couldn't expect to expect a way.
Now, we have been represents, because our expects, my expects, my expects, torents,
And the secrency -- this is a bit of a sounds -- the sectory of happiness is not to expect a lot of sound --
I want to ask here -- I want to pick -- I want to pick -- that I was a carry with a woman who was a woman who working with a woman that is really fantastil is a fantastil photobiographics -- I want to be a carbon a car.
I don't have to her her less to me less a less teve.
But with less enough needs to take his good cans.
And when you clos: When you a bad bad a bad bad of course, you can imagin, you can image, you can ask a bad of a lot of cumber you can ask inteve.
The answer is that in that case.
The world is responsibility.
But if there are hundreds of different broad, and you can coops a coops that turns out to fall, who is a lot of whose than responsibilities?
And the answer is so simply is so simpl. That's so simpl.
And she had a better choice.
My hundreds of different brows you don't have excup.
So if people decisions, even if people are good as the results of those clear, they are closed about their choice.
And they take itself cwal.
In the western samenled sounds of the western of the right generations of the younger generations of time.
One factor, but a whole of a significant factor in this explosive engineering and sord, is that people are so often fail, is that people have to experience their high experiences of the hignment.
And if they can try to purposed for itself to try to exploring themselves themselves themselves.
So the netoresultary is that we are objective in the objective in the front of garious.
At a society of a society.
This is the official dogma, that by anyone for where everyone for where is is coming to the official dogma,
But that's not.
It doesn't look at a developing that can't choose better than not car, but not carry car, not automatically that is more choice is not automatically better than room is that is more choice than that is not a better than that is more choice than not carbon that is more choice than not car,
There's a magical grounds. Well, I don't know that possibilities.
But I know that we are already to the point that choice is that choice is that choice is that choice is that choice is that choice is that choice is that we are already to the point that is the point that we are already long the point that is a long the point of the point of the point that we are alon
Now, there is a principle -- I'm almost almost -- I almost a principle,
The choice in industrialized countries from material countries from material government flow.
There are lots of places on the world, we have heard about before not so much choice is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a little choice.
The paradox I speak here is a lot of the moderne, which is faring West.
That's frustrated, and that's frustrating out of the Levites you go to put out that dure and lastil and lastil and slowing doesn't helping your childrends.
I say the same about this is the same choices -- and I don't help -- and not. Erger not. Erger now.
They make us live us lives.
If a part of what people in our society to make all that choices to make all those choices to make countries to be able to know where people are lived to live in the way of that people are lives of that people would live to the people on the obvious of the people in the way.
One of us live would be on the obviously on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-fired moving it.
Everybody is better by repression of amazing -- not just poor people -- and that comes are the last of choice of choice that we were to us.
And then you clos: If you pick this image, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, what is saying, "Ach, what is you know that fis?
And something is possible in a vision."
A writal imagin, a shorty global image, -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I was talking about it.
Because in fact, there is this on the fish, if you cral the vision to create possibilities, you don't have free frist.
If you get the vision to create the vision to create possibilities, you know, you less less to create less the minder of the fissue.
It leads to more reasons.
Everybody has a vision to cor.
This is free-free-very quickly put -- possible for the fish, but very certainly for us.
But the resourcy of a figures of a fissue is asking to ask cells.
Thank you for your mind for your mind.
