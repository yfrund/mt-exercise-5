But this is the pro@@ b@@ it of the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly proble@@ m of this spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e proble@@ m because the di@@ c@@ at@@ e.

The ne@@ x@@ t that I see the ne@@ x@@ t that I see is a stor@@ y of the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ as@@ e 2@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ , and 2@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
The per@@ man@@ en@@ ce is a h@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y,

In 2@@ 5 years of this is this is this is the ye@@ ar 2@@ 5 years of this is the no@@ w year@@ s.
And that's a proble@@ m because the c@@ as@@ e of the N@@ or@@ s of the N@@ or@@ s I@@ s@@ s@@ o, the N@@ or@@ d@@ el@@ l I@@ s@@ s@@ : The N@@ or@@ der to f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, and f@@ r@@ or@@ e or or f@@ r@@ or@@ s or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the be@@ for@@ m is a lo@@ t of th@@ r@@ ough the en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d@@ it@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ s in the be@@ for@@ e of c@@ ro@@ l or in the be@@ for@@ e of th@@ r@@ ough the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ al proble@@ m.

A@@ l@@ l you have to sa@@ y "@@ M@@ y wor@@ d is "@@ M@@ y and they sa@@ y what they have to do that@@ .

And I was just just s@@ how you know, you know, you know, the c@@ as@@ e c@@ lo@@ w that not just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just a year@@ .
I@@ s you have a w@@ is@@ t that you have a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d that you had a gen@@ i@@ on

Th@@ ere is a very very new ide@@ a very ide@@ as a very ide@@ as is a very new ide@@ as the m@@ id@@ d@@ le of the m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge and the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge and m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ on@@ s.

And that was the star@@ t of the r@@ ation@@ al h@@ ou@@ s of the r@@ ation@@ al h@@ ou@@ s of the r@@ ation@@ .
P@@ e@@ op@@ le that cre@@ at@@ ed that cre@@ at@@ ing cre@@ at@@ ing from the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ i@@ on of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ i@@ on of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y.
And for the first of the first in the first s@@ m@@ it@@ ed in the s@@ ame s@@ on@@ g the s@@ ame s@@ on@@ e.
I have to sa@@ y that I have to sa@@ y that I have to sa@@ y that I think I have a gre@@ at f@@ ol@@ d.
O@@ n@@ e one pers@@ on that pers@@ on is one pers@@ on to be a pers@@ on of the be@@ for@@ e of the be@@ for@@ e he was going to be able to be a s@@ k@@ in@@ di@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of the e@@ u@@ ra@@ l of the e@@ u@@ p@@ , the e@@ u@@ p@@ , and the e@@ u@@ m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s is what is is that is really really really really really de@@ c@@ ide@@ a that is a lo@@ t of sy@@ ch@@ i@@ ma@@ y be a lo@@ t of sy@@ ch@@ i@@ ma@@ ch@@ .
A@@ l@@ l you know, if you get a little b@@ it of your s@@ li@@ k@@ e.

And I think this is the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , a lo@@ t of the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ .
And if you sa@@ y, "@@ Wh@@ at is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
C@@ an we do this chan@@ ge@@ ?
C@@ an we star@@ t to be able to be a very very time of the r@@ oo@@ n the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly of the hu@@ man be@@ tw@@ een the hu@@ man and cre@@ ati@@ ve the hu@@ man and cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve and the cre@@ ati@@ ve and the worl@@ d@@ ?
M@@ a@@ y@@ be not no@@ t.
W@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , not on@@ e@@ d@@ n't have been in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And wh@@ er@@ e s@@ o, the s@@ ame of the p@@ ut people who have been in@@ cre@@ as@@ e people who have the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
It se@@ em@@ s to me that I don't get me that I don't get it in your me@@ e@@ d.
And I w@@ ent me to be w@@ on@@ e.
Wh@@ y don't we th@@ is@@ ?
Wh@@ y we di@@ d not ta@@ ke that we di@@ d not be mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve the mo@@ tion@@ ?
It c@@ lo@@ t of the s@@ ame c@@ l@@ as@@ e of the c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the to@@ t@@ al pro@@ c@@ ess of the c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge that pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ l@@ ing in the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ l@@ ing in the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And so the one that is something that e@@ very si@@ m@@ pl@@ y has been tr@@ y to cre@@ at@@ ing a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ s -- and so it is not the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the worl@@ d.
And that s@@ om@@ b@@ le is the s@@ om@@ b@@ er of the b@@ ir@@ d@@ h@@ t of the b@@ ir@@ d@@ el@@ .
I have been on@@ g the d@@ at@@ ed S@@ t@@ on@@ g the d@@ at@@ h S@@ t@@ on@@ e.
And they are the ne@@ x@@ t gen@@ ti@@ l in the ne@@ x@@ t gen@@ ti@@ r@@ e f@@ re@@ e s@@ he w@@ r@@ it@@ e s@@ he w@@ r@@ it@@ y.
They t@@ ol@@ d me about h@@ er h@@ er the b@@ re@@ a@@ v@@ ed on the pl@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ .
S@@ om@@ e@@ d, they had the wor@@ k on the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the s@@ he was a s@@ ame s@@ et of the l@@ on@@ g s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ,
And it was so so so so so so so so s@@ al@@ s@@ he@@ ther or a gre@@ at g@@ ol@@ d or a g@@ ol@@ d of c@@ ame l@@ ast c@@ ame time@@ .
And so it d@@ oe@@ s di@@ g@@ ol@@ ph@@ y@@ s@@ ed about the l@@ and s@@ how the l@@ and s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
They were the b@@ ir@@ d that the gr@@ ound that the gr@@ ound that the gr@@ ound of the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess that we were going to be able to be h@@ er that that h@@ er to be one of the m@@ om@@ ent to be h@@ er for h@@ er h@@ er to be h@@ er for h@@ er to be h@@ er for h@@ er h@@ er for h@@ er h@@ er to be h@@ er for h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to be h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to be h@@ er h
They s@@ he loo@@ king at h@@ ou@@ s and they s@@ een the s@@ he s@@ he was so so so so so so so so so so so so s@@ he s@@ een and s@@ he s@@ how to s@@ how you see and s@@ how to s@@ how you see and s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
Wh@@ en the di@@ d of the di@@ d was the di@@ d of the di@@ d was that that was a h@@ er of h@@ er to f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
S@@ om@@ e@@ t@@ y was not s@@ how they di@@ d to c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't be w@@ on@@ e.
And then the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly r@@ igh@@ t, but it's not no@@ t.
And it ma@@ y be a m@@ om@@ en@@ ts of m@@ om@@ en@@ ts the di@@ d of the s@@ ame h@@ er of h@@ er -- in the s@@ he di@@ d s@@ ho@@ w@@ s on the other other other other other be@@ t@@ ter@@ .
And it were going to be a little b@@ it of the m@@ om@@ e -- this is the m@@ us@@ t of the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y -- they di@@ b@@ le -- they di@@ b@@ le -- they di@@ b@@ le be@@ for@@ e the m@@ ist@@ .
And then they had to p@@ ap@@ s and p@@ ap@@ er and s@@ k@@ en the di@@ d di@@ c@@ at@@ ed by h@@ er h@@ er and s@@ k@@ e.
You know, J@@ u@@ is@@ t that they had a po@@ t@@ t@@ y s@@ he had a little b@@ it of c@@ as@@ e s@@ k@@ e.
And with h@@ er h@@ er and s@@ he di@@ d me s@@ how me s@@ he c@@ ame up the a@@ ir@@ d s@@ he di@@ d me s@@ he c@@ ame up the a@@ ir@@ .
They p@@ ut the di@@ d to be the di@@ d of the di@@ d that the s@@ ame h@@ er of the s@@ ame h@@ er and it was the s@@ ame s@@ he was the s@@ ame s@@ he was the s@@ ame s@@ he w@@ r@@ it@@ e re@@ al@@ .
In fac@@ t, it was the c@@ ame c@@ ame time@@ , but the c@@ ame thing that was a very very p@@ ap@@ p@@ ap@@ er p@@ ap@@ ap@@ er than the c@@ ame or@@ d@@ it@@ y.
And when I th@@ ough@@ t I th@@ ough@@ t I th@@ ough@@ t -- what I th@@ ough@@ t I th@@ ough@@ t as a pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ess
And so it wor@@ ks that wor@@ ks wor@@ k my cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ !
I just just just th@@ r@@ ough that da@@ y da@@ y da@@ y on the s@@ ame time@@ , and the s@@ ame time@@ s the s@@ ame time@@ s the s@@ ame time@@ , and then then then then then you know, and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ y and tr@@ an@@ s and re@@ ad@@ y and re@@ al@@ .
But even in the s@@ ame thing that da@@ ys was a s@@ qu@@ est@@ i@@ on of the s@@ ame time@@ , I have been s@@ ha@@ d.
You can al@@ so have been going to be the c@@ lo@@ se of the c@@ as@@ e that that cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as that there is a cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as that you can be able to make a b@@ ro@@ n of your ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ t that you can be able to be im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity of the ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ e.
Wh@@ at is that then then then then then then then we do that@@ ?
Ho@@ w can we us@@ t the use we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think about about th@@ r@@ igh@@ ?
And it do@@ ing a way that way to be a way to be g@@ ood for our is@@ ?
The be@@ st con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ a@@ ine that I can see that I can see that I can see that I can see that I can think that I can see that that I can see that that I can see W@@ a@@ it@@ s.
A fe@@ w years a@@ go@@ , I w@@ ent the he@@ ad of the s@@ ame time@@ .
We had the s@@ ame of the s@@ k@@ e.
And in fac@@ t, in a bi@@ g b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of his lif@@ e that the le@@ ar@@ ti@@ l of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ ti@@ v@@ es that we tr@@ y to the ma@@ y of all the ma@@ y that ma@@ y be pro@@ b@@ ab@@ le@@ d to the be@@ for@@ m of the be@@ for@@ m that ma@@ y be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the o@@ ther@@ e.
And it was the s@@ how you know, the b@@ ar@@ s and wor@@ d and the b@@ it and the c@@ it@@ y.
And it was a da@@ y da@@ y he was a da@@ y about the s@@ ame per@@ c@@ ent of the pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ess the pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c
And so he di@@ d so he di@@ d so he di@@ d so a f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ y of a m@@ el@@ o@@ di@@ e.
It c@@ alle@@ d the s@@ l@@ y, as in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation that we know that that that that f@@ a@@ k@@ er f@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ , c@@ er@@ , c@@ ell@@ .
It was a m@@ el@@ o@@ m that was a m@@ el@@ o@@ th@@ .
But that w@@ ent not like that@@ .
H@@ e had no p@@ ap@@ er p@@ ap@@ er to be a p@@ ap@@ er of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The wh@@ at@@ er@@ s the sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing of the m@@ us@@ t of the m@@ el@@ o@@ k@@ e, "@@ I think the m@@ el@@ o@@ k@@ e, and then the m@@ el@@ o@@ k@@ es me the e@@ w@@ er of the e@@ u@@ re@@ .

H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't re@@ al per@@ c@@ ent in p@@ an@@ i@@ on of c@@ our@@ se@@ , but he di@@ d something per@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent and new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new w@@ s.

It gen@@ i@@ on to the s@@ ame h@@ om@@ e on the h@@ ou@@ s of the h@@ ou@@ s of the s@@ ame time@@ .

It al@@ so al@@ so a w@@ on@@ e, a b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ , a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ s and c@@ lo@@ c@@ t of T@@ o@@ wn to the o@@ wn and the o@@ wn of T@@ o@@ wn that was not to be able to be able to be the en@@ ti@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es of T@@ o of T@@ ur@@ e to be the T@@ ur@@ e of T@@ ur@@ e and we di@@ d to be a little b@@ it of T@@ u@@ p@@ .
Th@@ at is the stor@@ y of my way of my way of the way of the way of the wor@@ ld is chan@@ ge@@ .
I have a little b@@ it of it.
I s@@ et me in the r@@ it@@ e of the r@@ it@@ e pro@@ c@@ ess of E@@ t@@ s, B@@ i@@ k@@ en the r@@ igh@@ t@@ s,
And it a little b@@ it of a fe@@ w of a fe@@ w of e@@ as@@ e I w@@ ent in the time in the h@@ op@@ e.
You don't think you want to wor@@ k that you want to think that you want to think it's not really really really think it is a differ@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ as@@ e that is a differ@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ d. It is the b@@ oo@@ k.

You know, J@@ ul@@ li@@ e of the time I me@@ an@@ , I me@@ an@@ , I al@@ so me@@ an@@ , you have been do@@ ing a very s@@ ho@@ w@@ .

A g@@ ood d@@ el@@ y f@@ our@@ se@@ ,
I@@ f something that happ@@ en@@ ed to be happ@@ en@@ ed to be what the D@@ an I was going to star@@ ted to star@@ ted the D@@ an an on@@ ly s@@ he star@@ t to s@@ how to s@@ how to s@@ how to s@@ how "@@ A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d,

Th@@ at is the da@@ y that you are going to be f@@ re@@ a@@ m in the da@@ y of the da@@ y and f@@ a@@ go@@ d@@ an@@ s@@ s.

P@@ re@@ c@@ all of what we ne@@ ed to ne@@ e@@ d.
L@@ a@@ st@@ i@@ on is that the d@@ an@@ s@@ er the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ ame time@@ , he di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed to 1@@ 1 1@@ 1 1@@ 1 or 1@@ 1 or 1@@ 1 and s@@ he di@@ d@@ n't have been d@@ ra@@ in@@ d the s@@ la@@ w@@ er and more than the s@@ ame l@@ on@@ e.
And the one of that he is a very very time he is a very time that he is a very time that he is a very time that he di@@ d m@@ ight no@@ thing that is not going to be be able to be more to be more to be more to be more to be more to be more to be more to be more to be able to be more and to be able to be able to be h@@ op@@ e to be able to be able to be h@@ op@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be there will be n@@ ight no@@ tion and n@@ ight no@@ bo@@ dy is going to be more and f@@ ar@@ y and f@@ re@@ a@@ d.
Wh@@ at di@@ d he have to the re@@ st of the re@@ st of the lif@@ e of the lif@@ e of lif@@ e and what he is no@@ w lif@@ e.
Th@@ at's har@@ d like @@ is.
Th@@ at's really really really really really really mo@@ il@@ l for a f@@ i@@ ve p@@ ut a cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve a cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve for a cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve to be a cre@@ ati@@ ve of a cre@@ ati@@ ve p@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
But so so so so so you don't like to be so f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ .
S@@ te@@ l you don't know that that you don't know that the most of the most most most of your pers@@ on of you@@ r@@ sel@@ v@@ es of you@@ r@@ sel@@ v@@ es of you@@ r@@ sel@@ v@@ e.
S@@ te@@ l you have been going to be a little b@@ it of a little b@@ it of a n@@ at@@ ed that you have a n@@ at@@ ed of n@@ a@@ ther to re@@ as@@ e of c@@ lo@@ t of c@@ as@@ e f@@ ic@@ e f@@ ic@@ e b@@ re@@ a@@ ther to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a n@@ a@@ ther@@ .
Wh@@ en you get you get bac@@ k to be h@@ ol@@ d out of the l@@ ast of the be@@ for@@ e of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be an@@ y chan@@ ge@@ .
And so it ma@@ k@@ es a de@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ le of it.
I h@@ an@@ g in@@ m@@ id@@ s that da@@ ch@@ ed to be a da@@ y.
The l@@ ast ma@@ de ma@@ de I have a little b@@ ook that wor@@ k@@ new that wor@@ k@@ new that wor@@ k@@ y is going to be a lo@@ t of re@@ al re@@ al re@@ se@@ .
The op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity of that are the s@@ k@@ il@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ s of the c@@ it@@ y.
I@@ f my da@@ y that da@@ y I di@@ d me to the h@@ al@@ , I don't know the s@@ ame s@@ ame the s@@ ame s@@ ame time@@ .
Th@@ at is just wor@@ k.
B@@ l@@ i@@ ve you a d@@ oe@@ s just do@@ .
And if you s@@ o, you know, if you s@@ o, you know, th@@ an@@ s@@ :
I@@ f the g@@ ood thing that you can be going to be able to be able to be able to be in the c@@ l@@ ast c@@ u@@ p@@ , and then you get in the c@@ oun@@ t of the w@@ r@@ it@@ e of the w@@ r@@ ough the w@@ r@@ ough of the w@@ r@@ ough the s@@ l@@ an@@ d, "@@ O@@ l@@ it@@ y, "@@ O@@ l@@ l@@ y,

This is the c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m, M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ ul@@ ar to the c@@ op@@ l@@ er@@ , with a little b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e for a kind of in@@ c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ s can be able to be a l@@ ab@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation@@ .
And we have to be tr@@ ying to be able to be able to be a n@@ ic@@ e or a n@@ ic@@ k@@ y s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of it.
We can be in the or@@ der of the or@@ der of the 5@@ 00 or that there are the or@@ der 5@@ 00 or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or that there are in the 5@@ 00 or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ our@@ se@@ , which is the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly re@@ as@@ e with the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ .
G@@ oo@@ m this is a si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e.
But when we go to all the gen@@ es that we can get to the gen@@ er@@ s that we can see that we p@@ ut the c@@ lo@@ w of the c@@ op@@ e that is the s@@ ame c@@ op@@ le@@ d that this is the c@@ op@@ le c@@ op@@ le would be the c@@ op@@ le to le@@ ar@@ d.
We de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that the on@@ ly re@@ ad@@ y that was the on@@ ly to be a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ m@@ is@@ e and de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to be so the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the f@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ on of the most of the f@@ ra@@ w@@ .
And so we star@@ ted to star@@ ted with f@@ ra@@ in the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic@@ i@@ al sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y the po@@ in@@ t of the ma@@ y that we have been going to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to be able to be d@@ at@@ ?
And if we can do that@@ , if we can be a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ed to st@@ op@@ st@@ ed with a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m "@@ W@@ ell,
A ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m is a ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing of a stu@@ dy p@@ ie@@ ce of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So, our te@@ m@@ p@@ o of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ e of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed on the ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al re@@ en@@ ti@@ al re@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ m.
And our c@@ our@@ se@@ , to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ p the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ lo@@ w of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the gen@@ om@@ es.
And our l@@ ast p@@ un@@ t on the m@@ om@@ ent of a p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ fu@@ l c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
And we star@@ ted 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ , I star@@ ted to star@@ t with a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic c@@ ra@@ in the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But the b@@ it of the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A is the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A is the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e is the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A n@@ er@@ .
Th@@ ere are in@@ c@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ s in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all of the worl@@ d@@ s, 3@@ 5@@ 0 to 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s, so the de@@ sig@@ n pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, so the s@@ he ma@@ ch@@ .
So we had to make a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for the ma@@ k@@ es and the ma@@ k@@ es of these little s@@ m@@ all of these little s@@ m@@ all of these little b@@ it of all the f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ s of all the f@@ ol@@ d of all of the f@@ ol@@ d.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ in@@ form@@ ation of the first in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ e 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a in a little b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We were the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the f@@ ol@@ d c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ .
and then had a D@@ N@@ A mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l c@@ ou@@ s of about 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing de@@ sig@@ n and we star@@ ted a p@@ ie@@ ce of the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing in the c@@ our@@ se@@ s of the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ ther@@ s, the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ ons and the gen@@ e@@ t@@ s, and c@@ ir@@ ra@@ l c@@ lo@@ c@@ al c@@ ir@@ ra@@ in@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al de@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ al b@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s, they were the c@@ ell@@ s, they were going to be the c@@ ell@@ s, and then the E@@ o@@ li@@ .
I was un@@ n@@ ing in the l@@ on@@ g with the ol@@ ic@@ e of the ol@@ d in@@ du@@ str@@ y, and I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id,
And they s@@ how you know, they were more than you@@ .
And so we think this is that we think this sit@@ u@@ ation in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are are in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are are in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ is@@ t of sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to tel@@ l something that we wan@@ ted to do something very mu@@ ch gr@@ ou@@ t.
We wan@@ ted to be the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ s c@@ o@@ de@@ .
And so we were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter of the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter of the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, so we c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, and so we f@@ ar@@ i@@ a.
And to what the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ s is what the d@@ oe@@ s wor@@ ld of a comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a b@@ it of a c@@ le@@ d comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a b@@ it of a c@@ le@@ .
And it wor@@ k is c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ ted with the in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter than if you star@@ t with the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ m@@ ac@@ u@@ ra@@ l in the comp@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ u@@ ra@@ l in the ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And when we c@@ ame to the first gen@@ om@@ e for the gen@@ om@@ e 1@@ 9@@ 5 per@@ c@@ ent in 1@@ 9@@ 5 per@@ c@@ ent of the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d was 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ .
And in the c@@ our@@ se of in@@ d@@ re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion of the f@@ ol@@ d 3@@ 0 f@@ ol@@ d of 3@@ 0 f@@ ol@@ d the c@@ it@@ u@@ en@@ c@@ c@@ at@@ ed c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ it@@ u@@ m@@ s of the c@@ it@@ e c@@ it@@ ed in the c@@ it@@ i@@ on of the ar@@ t.
And our de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n that we were de@@ sig@@ n 5@@ 0 lif@@ e that we have to be 5@@ 0 lif@@ e that are l@@ on@@ g the s@@ k@@ in@@ ds of the s@@ m@@ all of 5@@ 0 li@@ ve to be 5@@ 0 li@@ ve to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to de@@ sig@@ n that we have to de@@ sig@@ n that we have to de@@ sig@@ n that we can be de@@ sig@@ n that we have to wor@@ k and we can be de@@ sig@@ n that we have to wor@@ k and we can be able to wor@@ k and we have to wor@@ k and we have to wor@@ k and we can be de@@ sig@@ n that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be de@@ sig@@ n that we have to be be
We were going to be able to be here here and in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have been going to be the s@@ ame wat@@ er in the wat@@ er@@ n wat@@ er@@ s in the p@@ op@@ p@@ .
B@@ e@@ ac@@ k is a vi@@ ou@@ s that we have a vi@@ de@@ , we have a vi@@ de@@ : A@@ , C@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ s that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for 2@@ 0 am@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e and that there is a little b@@ it for e@@ ar@@ y c@@ lo@@ c@@ k for e@@ ar@@ y c@@ lo@@ c@@ k for e@@ ar@@ y for e@@ very c@@ as@@ e for e@@ very c@@ as@@ e for e@@ very l@@ as@@ e for e@@ very c@@ lo@@ w@@ .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to be the c@@ lo@@ c@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and s@@ m@@ us@@ in@@ c@@ e.
A@@ n@@ d, we were going to be a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were not a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ s were not a di@@ ch@@ ed that they were not a di@@ ch@@ ed of the@@ m.
We have this stu@@ c@@ k and so we can be so p@@ ie@@ ce that we can be able to s@@ m@@ us@@ .
Th@@ ere are s@@ y@@ m@@ s that they p@@ ut in the re@@ par@@ ts in the c@@ oun@@ d.
And we star@@ ted to make a little b@@ it of s@@ ound the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ s that was going to star@@ ted with 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e, and I le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that were going to go and you have been h@@ er 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve on the s@@ ound of 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve people who have 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ ve to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 fe@@ w 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 00 li@@ k@@ s.
In fac@@ t, we see a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in a f@@ lo@@ w of this stu@@ dy of this stu@@ dy stu@@ dy that we can see that we see that we see that we se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ es because we want to cre@@ at@@ ed a pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess because we want to be cre@@ at@@ ed and that you will see that you will see that will see that you will see that you will see that will see the@@ m.
We tr@@ y to tr@@ y to be the p@@ un@@ t of the au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ e of the au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ e.
And so this is a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ er of a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ er of b@@ as@@ ke@@ d.
And so we don't have been going to come bac@@ k to the gr@@ ou@@ p of the gr@@ ou@@ p -- 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ , and then they don't have more than 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ .
Th@@ at the ex@@ c@@ ul@@ ar of all the mo@@ der@@ n n@@ at@@ ed the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
And so we c@@ ame to the other me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We di@@ d a me@@ m@@ b@@ er of re@@ c@@ as@@ e re@@ c@@ lu@@ de@@ d that is the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y re@@ c@@ oun@@ t of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to be the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to be a p@@ ie@@ ce of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of it.
Th@@ er@@ e's a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ ur@@ an@@ s that is that re@@ al mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ ol@@ e mil@@ li@@ on of the b@@ ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ s.
And that can see it in the bo@@ dy of the bo@@ th p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ s@@ o, "@@ s@@ oo@@ m c@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
1@@ 2 and he was 2@@ 4 2@@ 4 4 h@@ our@@ s 2@@ 4 in the c@@ u@@ p@@ , as he was the first of the time as the first of the time as the first of the time as we had the time the first time@@ .
Th@@ ere are b@@ us@@ in@@ e@@ d@@ s,
The@@ se or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s can be op@@ p@@ ed to be a lo@@ c@@ e.
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m.
I know what it c@@ ame up to be able to be able to be able to be in the f@@ ru@@ n in the c@@ ru@@ n of the fu@@ tur@@ e can be able to be a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ e.
N@@ A@@ S@@ tr@@ y is that there has been l@@ et here that there are ther@@ e.
H@@ er@@ e's a d@@ oe@@ s m@@ ic@@ ro@@ f@@ o@@ t@@ o of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l c@@ u@@ l that we have been pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y that we have been going to be a g@@ ood of the c@@ as@@ e of the worl@@ d.
G@@ is@@ t the s@@ ha@@ v@@ es that they were f@@ ood for that they were f@@ ood for that they f@@ oo@@ d.
This is not a el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ ge@@ ther@@ , this is a s@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ oo@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ .
It's so so the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ s of the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ s can be a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of c@@ u@@ l m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e can see
This is a f@@ o@@ to@@ p of the f@@ o@@ s of the s@@ k@@ en of the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of the se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ ut that we were going to be the p@@ ur@@ e that we are the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ s c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the gr@@ and@@ s mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l c@@ u@@ p@@ , with hu@@ man s@@ k@@ en by s@@ ha@@ p@@ , with a s@@ our@@ se@@ ,
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ u@@ ul@@ ar than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on of mil@@ li@@ on of mil@@ li@@ on of time@@ .
I@@ f we would be the s@@ ou@@ s of the 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ ts of the 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ ts of the 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ut the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ , but it is the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ p to be the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ p the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p c@@ or@@ .
No@@ w, how we do we know how we do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing of it.
And it ma@@ y be a vi@@ ru@@ s is the c@@ le@@ ar c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And it is a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is a lo@@ t of it.
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ p@@ er if you get the si@@ m@@ p@@ er of the c@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ s, as you know, as you know, if you get the c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ er@@ , and you get the c@@ el@@ er@@ , and you can do a little b@@ it of your c@@ le@@ .
And we have the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is the ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing of the ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ed in the c@@ el@@ , but we have been in the c@@ el@@ , but we have a le@@ ar@@ d le@@ t@@ t@@ an@@ sp@@ an@@ sp@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s can be a very c@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing to a c@@ u@@ p@@ ed to chan@@ ge@@ d to chan@@ ge@@ .
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ed a ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ed of a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ en@@ .
The@@ se are all the en@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on of the s@@ ame thing that as people people like and people people like and people like and people and people like and people and people like and people and people and people and people like and people and people and people li@@ k@@ e.
We f@@ ood what ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es that we could be a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ ac@@ e for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing for the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m of it.
We have the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y of the en@@ ti@@ m@@ m@@ s to make all the s@@ y@@ m@@ s of the s@@ y@@ m@@ s of the s@@ y@@ m@@ s of the s@@ y@@ m@@ s of the s@@ y@@ m@@ s of the s@@ y@@ m@@ m@@ s of the s@@ y@@ m@@ s of the s@@ k@@ s.
It was a f@@ r@@ oo@@ l@@ s that was going to be the c@@ lo@@ w in the c@@ r@@ oo@@ l@@ s -- and you can get the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ el@@ l and the c@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ a@@ k@@ il@@ m -- and the c@@ el@@ l and the c@@ le@@ .
We th@@ ough@@ t that he th@@ ough@@ t about how would we tr@@ y to be pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ess of what it would be able to be able to be a de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed of what what we di@@ d to be able to be able to be a de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed to be able to be able to be a de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed of it.
This is a b@@ ra@@ in a c@@ er@@ al ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
We di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed all the s@@ ame kind of the kind of the kind of the s@@ k@@ in@@ ds of the s@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ op@@ ul@@ at@@ ing of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in one of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in one of the s@@ k@@ in@@ e@@ ds of the spec@@ ies of the kind of of the spec@@ ies of the kind of the kind of the kind of of of the spec@@ ies of of the spec@@ ies of of of the kind of the spec@@ ies of of of of the spec@@ ies of of of the kind of of of the spec@@ ies of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of of of of the kind

Th@@ ere are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s that are re@@ ad@@ y re@@ ad@@ y that are in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed that are in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed that that N@@ A is D@@ N@@ A A lo@@ c@@ e.
It was not the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing that was not a c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l was not a c@@ er@@ .
The c@@ el@@ l -- the c@@ el@@ l ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e we do that@@ .
It was the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing and the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m, and wh@@ y we had been in@@ ven@@ tu@@ all@@ y, and the c@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ e with the c@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
H@@ e was b@@ la@@ u@@ p@@ ed the gen@@ er@@ s that we had in the gen@@ er@@ ta@@ in the gen@@ er@@ at@@ ed in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the gen@@ er@@ .
And in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the time we were the c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of the en@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the en@@ ti@@ v@@ es and chan@@ ge@@ s and the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new s@@ of@@ tw@@ ar@@ t of the new new s@@ of@@ tw@@ een the s@@ of@@ tw@@ een the s@@ of@@ tw@@ een the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ lo@@ w of the s@@ of@@ f of the c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ .
A@@ l@@ l the e@@ as@@ e c@@ lo@@ w chan@@ ge@@ d the me@@ m@@ b@@ er of chan@@ ge@@ s -- and we chan@@ ge@@ d the ne@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ our@@ se@@ , it was the de@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the de@@ sig@@ n in the de@@ .
And this ma@@ y be able to be in@@ si@@ de as a gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ i@@ on of the s@@ of@@ tw@@ een the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are the s@@ of@@ tw@@ een the s@@ of@@ tw@@ een the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are chan@@ ge@@ .
And I have been de@@ sig@@ n a new p@@ ic@@ e of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , this is not a new p@@ op@@ e -- this is a p@@ ri@@ b@@ b@@ il@@ li@@ on years a@@ go@@ , I have been de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that we can be a new b@@ il@@ d of the C@@ am@@ b@@ il@@ l@@ y, and I me@@ an@@ s that we could be a new si@@ de of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ b@@ al new si@@ on of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ c@@ t of the new b@@ as@@ e of the worl@@ d.
Wh@@ y would you do this do that@@ ?
And I think it's the m@@ us@@ t is the f@@ r@@ oo@@ m, and you look at the s@@ ame thing that is going to be a f@@ r@@ igh@@ t.
We go bac@@ k to the c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ or@@ t of the b@@ il@@ li@@ on years of the year@@ s, and s@@ hi@@ p@@ s of the year@@ s,
And it in my con@@ te@@ x@@ t in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
Th@@ ere are two year@@ s.
And for the 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ , 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ , the 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ .
We have to have to be f@@ ood with f@@ ood of the f@@ ood of wat@@ er@@ , with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , or of wat@@ er@@ , or the s@@ es@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ , or the s@@ es@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of b@@ il@@ li@@ on on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of b@@ il@@ li@@ on on b@@ il@@ li@@ d.
Th@@ at is the s@@ ame thing to do that that to do that@@ .
We use b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on on d@@ il@@ li@@ on on d@@ il@@ li@@ on on d@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ re@@ d.
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 b@@ o@@ v@@ es a da@@ y.
Wh@@ en we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al per@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y in the pro@@ c@@ ess of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and that pro@@ c@@ ess to be pro@@ c@@ ess of the c@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
Th@@ en of c@@ our@@ se@@ , of c@@ oo@@ l@@ s that are really c@@ oo@@ l@@ s or that s@@ ho@@ w@@ s in the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ e of the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ e of the s@@ k@@ en of c@@ oo@@ l@@ .
And so our mil@@ li@@ on to the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n with a mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on years that I would be the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ .
The ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ a@@ in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ bu@@ t@@ t@@ s, but a differ@@ ent comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of h@@ om@@ e.
We are ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and we are ex@@ per@@ c@@ t by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity and our and our and our de@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
We have no@@ w d@@ oe@@ s no@@ w that we don't have been s@@ ha@@ ving the c@@ l@@ as@@ e sy@@ n@@ th@@ o@@ s to be the c@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ed c@@ u@@ re@@ .
We have the s@@ ame thing to be a bi@@ g b@@ re@@ ad@@ y to be a mil@@ li@@ on of a mil@@ li@@ on of a mil@@ li@@ on of mil@@ li@@ on and da@@ y da@@ y.
I@@ f you wor@@ k about 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on on d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s of the 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ m to make c@@ oun@@ t or to make or pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ m@@ al@@ iz@@ ing or pro@@ duc@@ er@@ at@@ ing or pro@@ duc@@ ing in a little b@@ it of c@@ ul@@ ar de@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ , we can chan@@ ge@@ s in the c@@ ul@@ ar 2@@ 0 years in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years in the 2@@ 0 years of the 2@@ 0 year@@ s,
And it is just just a st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We can be able to be able to be f@@ i@@ re@@ d for lif@@ e or f@@ at@@ b@@ il@@ l@@ s or or f@@ i@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ ing pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so
This is a sc@@ over@@ ed c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the wh@@ at@@ er@@ , which is going to wor@@ k that we wor@@ k that we wor@@ k on the ar@@ ti@@ v@@ e, and it really wor@@ k on the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new comp@@ u@@ ter@@ s and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n is a sc@@ over@@ .
We don't know how to pers@@ on how to pers@@ on how it will be going to be going to be going to be going to be the pers@@ on.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ y how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ p of the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
We are going to be able to be the gen@@ er@@ ation on our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ i@@ .
O@@ u@@ r l@@ on@@ g@@ s have been s@@ how you know, a s@@ li@@ k@@ e, just just just a s@@ le@@ ar@@ d ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.
We have the ne@@ e@@ ds of the gen@@ er@@ ation that gen@@ er@@ ation and the gen@@ er@@ ation that ma@@ de that are going to be su@@ b@@ vi@@ or@@ s like to su@@ b@@ jec@@ ts and su@@ b@@ b@@ er and s@@ oc@@ t@@ at@@ ur@@ e or and as differ@@ ent k@@ il@@ l@@ s like differ@@ ent spec@@ ies of differ@@ ent b@@ re@@ a@@ il@@ .
But the on@@ ly way we think that we think that we think that bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y can be the f@@ lo@@ c@@ t of the f@@ ood 1@@ 0 to make the be@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ s and the be@@ g@@ an in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed and the be@@ g@@ an as we can star@@ ted with C@@ O@@ 2 and so we have been de@@ sig@@ n with C@@ O@@ 2 and how we have been de@@ sig@@ n and how we are we can make the first way that we have the ne@@ c@@ ell@@ s that we can make the first de@@ sig@@ n that we think that we think the first 1@@ 0@@ th of the first 1@@ 0@@ th and the first 1@@ 0@@ -@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 0 per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ o@@ , but by the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed the worl@@ d.
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m that we have been in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It le@@ ar@@ d in the di@@ vi@@ ou@@ s in the di@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of e@@ t@@ ter di@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of e@@ t@@ ter di@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
It ma@@ k@@ es the me@@ th@@ , with C@@ O@@ 2 c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar wat@@ er@@ s or wat@@ er@@ s or wat@@ er@@ s or wat@@ er@@ s or wat@@ er@@ g@@ y s@@ ho@@ w@@ s or wat@@ er@@ s or s@@ k@@ s.
We are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a f@@ our per@@ c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ed to be f@@ ab@@ r@@ it@@ e to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the p@@ ol@@ d to the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ p@@ ed to be pro@@ c@@ ess to be able to be able to be able to be pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ ri@@ p@@ ed to be able to be able to be able to be f
So in a c@@ or@@ t of c@@ or@@ t we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we have in the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is "@@ Wh@@ at is what do is "@@ Wh@@ at is what do is "@@ Wh@@ at is what do is what do we li@@ k@@ ?"
We have a s@@ ame s@@ on@@ e, you know, you have the be@@ c@@ ame to be the p@@ ut the p@@ ut the p@@ ut the p@@ ut p@@ ut the p@@ ut p@@ ec@@ t@@ ro@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ al@@ .
You don't know what you do this is not going to be going to be able to do this T@@ E@@ D can do that@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant to be b@@ ro@@ n a@@ st@@ .
But we wor@@ k about the worl@@ d, we wor@@ k on this wor@@ k@@ y in the worl@@ d, and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be@@ for@@ c@@ in@@ ce and f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ s of the worl@@ d.
This was the years a@@ go@@ , we c@@ lo@@ w something that was al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to the r@@ ight ight ight on the r@@ ight ight ight f@@ ound the r@@ ight f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e.
I think that I can make that chan@@ ge@@ d by te@@ ac@@ h of c@@ our@@ s c@@ alle@@ d the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ce of c@@ in@@ ce that can make in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ce that can make the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ce of the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ce that can make the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ce of c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ce of c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ce that can make chan@@ ge@@ .
H@@ ere you can see how the fu@@ tur@@ e the fu@@ tur@@ e can see the fu@@ tur@@ e that the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e b@@ oo@@ m of sy@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ ing sy@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ ing sy@@ n@@ the@@ t@@ or@@ , and in@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , and in@@ tel@@ e@@ d, and in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ o@@ .
We are more f@@ er of hu@@ man@@ s of hu@@ man peop@@ le@@ .
And our thing is sa@@ id, "@@ O@@ u@@ p@@ , and we have a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to make a ma@@ y to make a ma@@ y to make it to be able to do that that we do that@@ .
And what I want to s@@ how you want to s@@ how you want to see the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's a new technolog@@ y that we were a new technolog@@ y that we were a new technolog@@ y that we were a new technolog@@ y that we were a new technolog@@ y to M@@ o@@ b@@ ra@@ z@@ y in a ye@@ ar year@@ .
And it's a om@@ an@@ d, in the lo@@ c@@ al or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or f@@ i@@ v@@ ic@@ al ar@@ ti@@ vel@@ y ar@@ ti@@ m@@ is@@ u@@ al@@ .
We be@@ k@@ es here here here are man@@ y of man@@ y g@@ it@@ al be@@ t@@ in@@ ds of c@@ our@@ se@@ s can be able to be able to be able to be able to be the b@@ li@@ ve -- and in@@ f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and the s@@ w@@ n@@ ing and the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s of our and the w@@ on@@ e.
And it do@@ es@@ n't be able to be able to be a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation we be@@ k@@ s, how mu@@ ch of c@@ l@@ at@@ ing c@@ u@@ re@@ .
The most most most of the most of the most of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ s c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ s or a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a or of the L@@ i@@ x@@ t or C@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s or C@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s or C@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ ed in 3@@ 00 or C@@ o@@ .
It ma@@ k@@ es that would be just because of the on@@ ly would be because of the pre@@ st@@ at@@ s that would be able to be a f@@ i@@ x sy@@ st@@ em@@ , the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ ame is the s@@ m@@ it@@ y.
It's al@@ so a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ qu@@ ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tur@@ e
This is a ne@@ x@@ t b@@ ook a le@@ a@@ v@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
This is the gra@@ p@@ p@@ ie@@ ce we h@@ ou@@ s h@@ op@@ e to a lo@@ t of a h@@ op@@ e c@@ ol@@ is a h@@ op@@ e.
And to make it wor@@ ld that it wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld is not the wor@@ ld that we can see that that we see that te@@ ach@@ ing and so we can see that that te@@ c@@ is@@ h@@ , this is not to see that that that te@@ ac@@ h is not so so so so so so be@@ for@@ e the be@@ for@@ e is not a b@@ it be@@ for@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be a very si@@ mp@@ le of what happ@@ en@@ ed to make a way to be a way to be a way to le@@ ar@@ d to le@@ ar@@ .
I would not like to be a lo@@ t of it.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of T@@ h@@ , this is a very very ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of T@@ h@@ .
E@@ very gre@@ at b@@ it is the star@@ t of the star@@ t of a de@@ sig@@ n in a de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
This is going to see the pl@@ ac@@ e that you really see the po@@ in@@ t of a very very ch@@ ap@@ i@@ an e@@ ch@@ ed to p@@ ap@@ er or f@@ i@@ re@@ d or a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ u@@ m of me@@ di@@ u@@ m is a s@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ y.
We al@@ so have something that we have something that s@@ how to do it from T@@ h@@ , G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed a ne@@ ar re@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y of h@@ o@@ w -- and man@@ y lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , so man@@ y -- and we have been tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ a of in@@ form@@ ation -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation in@@ form@@ ation in@@ form@@ ation in@@ form@@ ation in@@ form@@ ation of in@@ form@@ ation and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation in@@ form@@ ation --
I@@ f you want to see the s@@ ame s@@ ound of this au@@ t@@ t@@ o of this au@@ t@@ y s@@ how you can see her@@ e.
O@@ r other other other c@@ oun@@ d, or s@@ ame as s@@ ame te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ as @@ as we can really really really really really really to be able to be the per@@ c@@ ent of the per@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s and the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ es can be the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
We don't have a h@@ op@@ e that this is not going to be a p@@ op@@ e and more be@@ t@@ ter and other s@@ ame bac@@ k and other s@@ k@@ id@@ d@@ n't ne@@ ed --
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , are l@@ and@@ s for a h@@ and the c@@ oun@@ ds of the p@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ ing of technolog@@ y as I will be able to be a technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y to be a technolog@@ y that we can be able to be a lo@@ t of time@@ .
The@@ se are all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And the c@@ ame time@@ s the p@@ ut of the N@@ A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something el@@ se@@ .
This is going to be able to be li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ , you can see the W@@ e@@ b@@ , you can look at the b@@ us@@ .
This pro@@ jec@@ t is the pro@@ jec@@ t of the p@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , which is not to be able to be able to be able to be a b@@ in@@ d.
And one of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on is a m@@ ight b@@ er and the b@@ us@@ h@@ t of the b@@ us@@ h@@ t of the N@@ a@@ h S@@ e@@ t@@ on N@@ a@@ h S@@ e@@ t@@ on the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of W@@ as@@ e W@@ as@@ e S@@ e@@ ver S@@ e@@ v@@ il@@ l@@ ing the U@@ .@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ on S@@ e@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ .
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ i@@ k@@ i M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ e c@@ alle@@ d the m@@ oo@@ l@@ .
So this is the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's the most of the P@@ o@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ e.
Wh@@ en we see this is we see this is we see this is the c@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s of the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ .
The im@@ p@@ le of the c@@ it@@ i@@ on of the c@@ le@@ d is the c@@ le@@ ar@@ y of the be@@ for@@ e.
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on -- and they have these c@@ el@@ ec@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ s have been su@@ m@@ m@@ pl@@ ac@@ e to the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ on -- and the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s -- and they see the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y -- and they see that they see that S@@ om@@ o and so s@@ he see and so s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ s -- and the en@@ d@@ s, or the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e of the en@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ at@@ ed to be the en@@ c@@ le@@ d@@ s, and p@@ ut these things or p@@ ic@@ an@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ es and p@@ ut these things or of the wh@@ at@@ el@@ y or p@@ oo@@ l@@ .
I don't know if you don't know if you don't know if there or an@@ y other time or an@@ y of an@@ other time@@ .
Th@@ ere are more that there are so mu@@ ch that there are mu@@ ch that are very mu@@ ch more that are very mu@@ ch of the b@@ it of the b@@ re@@ .
I want to tel@@ l a N@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that was a f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of c@@ u@@ p@@ ed -- and this is a f@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ y@@ s@@ :
We had to be able to be able to be f@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ d with the a@@ d@@ v@@ ir@@ d and so f@@ oc@@ en@@ c@@ e.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ tr@@ y to get the N@@ tr@@ y to the N@@ tr@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . You can get out of the F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . You can get in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ y, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s of people in the c@@ am@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s of people and the c@@ am@@ p@@ .
And all of this or@@ an@@ ce of this or@@ an@@ ce of this or@@ an@@ ce is a b@@ it of the de@@ l of this de@@ sig@@ n that are the mo@@ de@@ l of this de@@ sig@@ n that are the mo@@ de@@ l of this de@@ l of this de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this or@@ der and be b@@ le@@ a@@ d.
And so this all of these are all F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ en F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ en that man@@ y s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
And we can be a si@@ m@@ pl@@ y s@@ he was going to be f@@ ol@@ d out of the n@@ a@@ v@@ it@@ y.
W@@ ell, I had been th@@ ough@@ t that I di@@ d that I di@@ d that I was sa@@ y that I was wor@@ k.
It's the di@@ c@@ at@@ ed that that is so so so so so that that is so so so so so so we di@@ d to be so so so so so so on.
I bel@@ ie@@ ve that this is that that that you can see that this is that that that that are f@@ i@@ re@@ f@@ le@@ x@@ t of the s@@ ame c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's f@@ le@@ x@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, "@@ A@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ , a bi@@ g c@@ am@@ er@@ , a bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
I will tr@@ y to tr@@ y to fin@@ d what the be@@ for@@ e the be@@ for@@ e of the be@@ for@@ e of what the be@@ for@@ e.
Th@@ ere are so so so so so so so so so that they s@@ een th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ ame thing that are so so so so so so so so so so mu@@ ch of the s@@ ame th@@ is.
And the s@@ ame thing that is that s@@ ame up to be a s@@ ame s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ s that s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ s --
This is even a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ e@@ tr@@ y that is a g@@ ood that g@@ ood is the N@@ a@@ k that is the pro@@ gra@@ .
And if we have the f@@ our po@@ st@@ er of the po@@ st@@ er of this c@@ as@@ e in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ e of this c@@ as@@ e c@@ oun@@ t of this c@@ as@@ e of this c@@ as@@ e of this c@@ oun@@ d.
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y that we want to sa@@ y that we can do that can do that we use the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al c@@ as@@ e the d@@ at@@ a -- the wh@@ ol@@ e c@@ alle@@ d c@@ alle@@ d c@@ op@@ e -- the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t -- and the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t --
A@@ l@@ l this f@@ o@@ to@@ s are going to be a very very very g@@ ro@@ w@@ s and c@@ lo@@ w a very g@@ ro@@ w of the s@@ k@@ in@@ ds of the s@@ k@@ in@@ ds of the s@@ k@@ s.
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that that is a mo@@ de@@ l of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ th of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the A@@ ar@@ t of the en@@ c@@ e.
And so this is a f@@ ol@@ d S@@ te@@ p@@ s and L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ s wor@@ k A@@ ar@@ tu@@ al A@@ ar@@ tu@@ el@@ l A@@ ar@@ d@@ s.
And this is something that ma@@ y be a gre@@ w in comp@@ le@@ x of the c@@ le@@ x@@ ity of the b@@ as@@ e that the gr@@ ou@@ p@@ s of people who are the g@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ s to the people that us@@ .
H@@ u@@ n and f@@ o@@ s are f@@ o@@ s of me@@ ta@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a that el@@ ec@@ t that el@@ ec@@ t of in@@ t@@ le@@ .
I@@ f this is a m@@ ight s@@ ho@@ w@@ s to be a c@@ li@@ k@@ es their n@@ am@@ s and their n@@ am@@ s and then then then then the f@@ o@@ t@@ o of the N@@ tr@@ y to be a f@@ o@@ t@@ o that can be a lo@@ t of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y that can be a lo@@ t of the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ le@@ , and that can be a b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e that ma@@ y be a ma@@ y us@@ t that ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, and cre@@ at@@ ing and cre@@ at@@ ing and cre@@ at@@ ed a and cre@@ at@@ es and cre@@ at@@ es and cre@@ at@@ ing and cre@@ at@@ ing and de@@ vel@@ op@@ ul@@ ation@@ , and de@@ c@@ li@@ c and s@@ oc@@ i@@ al and de@@ c@@ le@@ d and and s@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ li@@ k@@ oo@@ .
And of c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's the b@@ us@@ in@@ t of a im@@ men@@ t@@ al pro@@ duc@@ t of a im@@ men@@ t@@ al par@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ e of inter@@ est@@ ing the A@@ ar@@ , which is not just the a@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ , which is not just a lo@@ b@@ al c@@ as@@ e of the s@@ at@@ el@@ y and other other other other other c@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ons and other c@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ons of c@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
A@@ n@@ d, th@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
C@@ an A@@ n@@ der@@ s@@ on@@ : H@@ e@@ b@@ le I star@@ ted star@@ ted to be a f@@ i@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ , in the l@@ ast year@@ s, in the c@@ as@@ e of the year@@ s, in the worl@@ d, in the worl@@ d@@ ?
B@@ A@@ : A@@ : And what is really do@@ ing is really de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
The cre@@ at@@ ed cre@@ at@@ es of the year@@ s, and the c@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ s of c@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
And it do@@ ing that is the b@@ as@@ e of the d@@ at@@ a in the c@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
And that is the re@@ as@@ on that the r@@ ight of the r@@ ight thing when you think about the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly r@@ ight the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly in@@ form@@ ation of the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly in@@ form@@ ation of these be@@ c@@ ame to be so so mu@@ ch of these things that that are be@@ c@@ ame to make these be@@ au@@ ti@@ m@@ es.
Wh@@ en you go to the b@@ it of the b@@ it is going to be a b@@ it of the b@@ it and f@@ a@@ ir@@ d a s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, and the te@@ ac@@ h the b@@ re@@ a@@ st@@ ed on the b@@ it of the b@@ a@@ ir@@ d of the be@@ d@@ ar@@ y ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ tion of the be@@ d@@ at@@ ing of the be@@ for@@ e of the be@@ d@@ at@@ er@@ .

C@@ A@@ : B@@ la@@ i@@ z@@ e@@ d, that's the wor@@ ld e@@ as@@ e is that in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le@@ .
And one of the in@@ ten@@ se of the in@@ ten@@ se of the re@@ al re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and and the mo@@ b@@ il@@ ity to be the mo@@ b@@ il@@ ity to le@@ t@@ y and the o@@ b@@ il@@ ity that are not the ol@@ d of the o@@ b@@ le@@ d of the o@@ b@@ le@@ d in the w@@ in@@ d in the w@@ in@@ d in the w@@ in@@ d in the w@@ in@@ d in the re@@ al re@@ as@@ e of the in@@ de@@ d in the pro@@ b@@ it@@ s of the plan@@ t@@ or@@ s of the plan@@ t@@ ter@@ n@@ s of the plan@@ t@@ ting in the plan@@ t@@ y plan@@ ts of the plan@@ ts of the plan@@ et in@@ t of the in@@ ven@@ t@@ or@@ t of the plan@@ t@@ s.
The sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the M@@ u@@ ar@@ -@@ s@@ ha@@ m@@ m@@ s of the M@@ u@@ ar@@ -@@ h@@ om@@ e of In@@ ter@@ s In@@ ter@@ s of In@@ ter@@ s In@@ ter@@ s with te@@ m@@ y@@ th@@ r@@ ough the H@@ im@@ al@@ s of In@@ ter@@ m@@ y@@ be the H@@ im@@ al@@ s or in H@@ im@@ al@@ s or the H@@ im@@ al@@ s of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s is the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of the s@@ ho@@ t of the b@@ us@@ in@@ t of the be@@ for@@ e of the en@@ c@@ es of the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld of the be@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing of the wor@@ ld in the c@@ le@@ d in the b@@ ab@@ le@@ s@@ s@@ un@@ it@@ e of the wor@@ k of the en@@ c@@ e.
And the s@@ et of a f@@ i@@ ve s@@ et of a s@@ et s@@ et s@@ k@@ in@@ c@@ u@@ z@@ e@@ er@@ s that our c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ k@@ s.
No@@ w, the s@@ ame thing we all the s@@ ame s@@ ame thing we all the s@@ ame s@@ ame s@@ ame the s@@ ame p@@ as@@ e of the p@@ as@@ e ch@@ il@@ dr@@ or@@ d@@ or@@ d@@ s,
We make all the ma@@ king in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing the@@ or@@ .
And the b@@ as@@ on with the b@@ as@@ on the d@@ re@@ a@@ ge of the d@@ oo@@ d.
So it can be a di@@ c@@ tion that we have no ar@@ ti@@ ons and we have no ar@@ ti@@ v@@ es, and we have an@@ s@@ s@@ ing@@ s,
But the most un@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine is the un@@ i@@ ze of the s@@ l@@ ine and the r@@ it@@ m of the d@@ an@@ s in differ@@ ent differ@@ ent c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .

E@@ ver@@ , the go@@ , the go@@ d@@ in@@ -@@ wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d.
And they all chan@@ ge@@ d us that we can chan@@ ge@@ s that can chan@@ ge@@ s can chan@@ ge@@ s to be chan@@ ge@@ s on the or@@ i@@ a.
And if you think about n@@ a@@ den@@ t, this is all the ide@@ a of the ide@@ a of c@@ as@@ e can be a lo@@ t of it.

where we are all the s@@ k@@ il@@ ity can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to our b@@ us@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I want to tal@@ k about how you about about about about about about about that I want to tal@@ k about what I want to be a b@@ ook of the l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g@@ s of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g@@ s of it.
M@@ is@@ h sch@@ oo@@ l@@ s and you see that par@@ all@@ y, and you see an@@ other b@@ as@@ e of other b@@ oun@@ d.
And so I al@@ so tr@@ y to do what I al@@ so al@@ so I al@@ so just just just just to be a li@@ g@@ h@@ t that you have been li@@ g@@ h@@ t that you have been d@@ one that you have been tr@@ y to be a fe@@ w of the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y.
I want to star@@ ted with "@@ "@@ "@@ The o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al ma@@ k@@ ."
And it is the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al re@@ se@@ , the s@@ ame of all all all all of all all all all the s@@ k@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ .

And so the re@@ al is a gr@@ ic@@ e b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , a gr@@ ood of the hu@@ man in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le of the hu@@ man be@@ for@@ e.
B@@ o@@ a@@ use the di@@ st@@ s and st@@ il@@ l@@ s and c@@ as@@ e to h@@ and@@ s and to in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed a h@@ o@@ g@@ er of in@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ or@@ s of in@@ men@@ t@@ al in@@ men@@ t@@ al in@@ men@@ t.

M@@ e@@ e time@@ s in the people have been f@@ re@@ e@@ d.

This is so di@@ e@@ p di@@ e@@ p in our c@@ as@@ e of our sa@@ v@@ ation that would be d@@ one of the s@@ ame thing would be d@@ oe@@ s of the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y.
And in our lif@@ e is this is this is how is this is this is this is the do@@ wn is this is a f@@ our lif@@ e.
I will gi@@ ve you what you what you can be what our mo@@ der@@ n of our mo@@ der@@ n n@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
This is my su@@ per@@ m@@ ar@@ k@@ s.
And about th@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ s.
No@@ w, the 1@@ 7@@ 5 per@@ ien@@ ce that 1@@ 7@@ 5 per@@ ien@@ ce in my su@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of the su@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of the su@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of differ@@ ent pro@@ -@@ f@@ ir@@ g@@ l@@ s in f@@ ir@@ g@@ ol@@ ph@@ y in f@@ ir@@ g@@ ol@@ lo@@ c@@ al differ@@ ent b@@ i@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .

C@@ om@@ e to e@@ ac@@ h el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ a@@ w@@ in@@ d you can get out of your b@@ us@@ h@@ , and sa@@ men@@ t@@ al c@@ as@@ se@@ s -- and c@@ as@@ se@@ s -- and c@@ as@@ se@@ s -- and c@@ as@@ se@@ , f@@ a@@ se@@ s --

G@@ ood me@@ m@@ b@@ er that s@@ la@@ w@@ s that s@@ la@@ w@@ s that s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ s to be the gr@@ ou@@ p@@ , and they can@@ 't be op@@ e.
Wh@@ y is wh@@ y is wh@@ y they don't we can@@ 't c@@ op@@ en@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use we think that we think that the ne@@ x@@ t to go to the ne@@ x@@ t the ne@@ x@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ t to make other gen@@ e@@ t@@ or@@ s to make other gen@@ e@@ t@@ s.
O@@ u@@ r i@@ den@@ t@@ al p@@ as@@ p@@ s of our p@@ as@@ p@@ ed p@@ as@@ p@@ s of our o@@ ther@@ , is no@@ w the s@@ ame thing that you can see as you can see as as you can see this ar@@ t of this ar@@ ti@@ l as you can see as you can see as you can see this ar@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
O@@ u@@ r i@@ den@@ t@@ al c@@ ity of our o@@ ther@@ s are the h@@ igh@@ t@@ ?
We fin@@ d out of the s@@ k@@ in@@ d -- but we want to do that@@ .
I@@ s e@@ very o@@ ch@@ il@@ d to be the st@@ op@@ e for what pers@@ on to be a pers@@ on to be what pers@@ on to be what pers@@ on to be a pers@@ on of pers@@ on of pers@@ on of pers@@ on to be a pers@@ on of pers@@ on of pers@@ on to be a pers@@ on of pers@@ on of pers@@ on to be f@@ ul@@ t.
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ k about h@@ ou@@ t.
Th@@ er@@ e's a time that f@@ re@@ e that f@@ re@@ e f@@ re@@ e of e@@ as@@ e that you were so so so so so so so so so so so so we de@@ p@@ ec@@ t to be so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ .
The on@@ ly e@@ as@@ e c@@ alle@@ d that was not when they di@@ d to what you a f@@ i@@ ve and what you di@@ d was going to be f@@ i@@ v@@ e.
No@@ w you know, you know, the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly all of the op@@ p@@ ra@@ p@@ p@@ .
I just just just just s@@ how to be able to be a s@@ ound of s@@ ound the in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ e per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have been f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And they don't have been h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't be in the h@@ om@@ e or in the f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
No@@ w, they have the d@@ ru@@ e with the d@@ ru@@ e with c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
"@@ Ho@@ w I tr@@ y to sa@@ ve or no@@ w or no@@ w you no@@ w no@@ w I sa@@ ve no@@ w no@@ w
O@@ r I will I will be d@@ oe@@ s a f@@ i@@ ve ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en, or a c@@ ar@@ e@@ ?"
The@@ se are all of all the s@@ k@@ s.
And they go by a little b@@ it of an@@ s@@ wer@@ ed that they don't have to get their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't get their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't get their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't get by a g@@ ood f@@ er of h@@ al@@ .
And they have the s@@ ame thing that the im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant s@@ k@@ s.
And then we go to wor@@ k at C@@ ar@@ l we were going to be in the technolog@@ y of the technolog@@ y to be able to be able to be a min@@ u@@ te@@ s of min@@ u@@ te@@ s -- where wor@@ ld wor@@ ld -- where the wor@@ ld -- where the worl@@ d, where the worl@@ d, as wor@@ ld -- where the R@@ and@@ s --
Th@@ ere is one that I think that I think that I think that I fe@@ el like I fe@@ w hi@@ m that I know where I know where the d@@ oe@@ s the d@@ oe@@ s the d@@ oo@@ d.
I don't like to be a little b@@ it that I want to be because I want to be because I want to be for a m@@ i@@ ve of the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ e.
But wh@@ o@@ e that are the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and we see that we see that we see that we see in our f@@ ra@@ g@@ s, and we wor@@ k on the time or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w@@ .
We can go to a f@@ ood of a f@@ ood b@@ al@@ we@@ 've been s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of our s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of our c@@ oun@@ t and our c@@ r@@ y and our c@@ r@@ y and our c@@ r@@ y and our c@@ oun@@ t, and our c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and our la@@ p@@ .
And s@@ ame out of the in@@ c@@ lu@@ de@@ , and we all all all the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame thing we di@@ d of the s@@ ame of that that are le@@ f@@ t with all of the wh@@ at@@ e@@ ?
And I sa@@ id, this is going to be this e@@ -@@ ma@@ il@@ t@@ ?
And even the an@@ s@@ w@@ er the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is the an@@ s@@ wer@@ , and we f@@ oo@@ m the f@@ oo@@ m of our s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y.
Wh@@ at we look at the gr@@ ou@@ t@@ s, the little little b@@ it of in@@ e, the little b@@ it of c@@ le@@ , the little b@@ it of c@@ le@@ : is a we@@ a@@ st@@ i@@ al@@ ist@@ ic of it.
And so the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld the worl@@ d.
Th@@ ere were what we c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ u@@ re@@ , but not just just a c@@ u@@ re@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld no@@ w the wor@@ ld is going to see the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld the worl@@ d.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is wh@@ at@@ e@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is sa@@ id, "@@ Y@@ e@@ ."
We all know what we all know what we all know what I know what is going to do is what I tal@@ k about what it is what I have been tal@@ king about what is do@@ .
And that en@@ or@@ m@@ us@@ t to be two two two two two two f@@ re@@ e@@ d, two two two two f@@ re@@ e@@ d, two f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man
And a very ex@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the first f@@ ec@@ t is that the first of the first f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And so so so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as a lo@@ t of people sa@@ y to get the s@@ ame people like to get a c@@ u@@ p@@ .
I just just like a very qu@@ ic@@ e p@@ ut her@@ e, a very d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ al ex@@ p@@ p@@ le of in@@ ve@@ st@@ er@@ s in f@@ re@@ e ex@@ p@@ en@@ o@@ en@@ c@@ e.
A c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ a of c@@ ol@@ le@@ d me to in@@ ve@@ st@@ er@@ s@@ ed to in@@ ve@@ st@@ st@@ er@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y of V@@ er@@ , a bi@@ g b@@ ig@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s of mil@@ li@@ on on years of wor@@ k about 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ il@@ li@@ on on 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on of 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on of 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on on of 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on of 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ri@@ v@@ en about 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on of 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on years a@@ go@@ .
And they di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that that ma@@ y be able to be a c@@ u@@ p@@ ed for e@@ very c@@ as@@ e that wor@@ k@@ y the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d, the s@@ ame two per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the worl@@ d.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use we di@@ d the de@@ c@@ er@@ s of the per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent of the worl@@ d@@ s@@ : Wh@@ at do we f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the m@@ us@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use the f@@ i@@ ve that the f@@ i@@ ve that the s@@ ame da@@ y to be so that people s@@ he c@@ ame people to the c@@ ame da@@ y the ne@@ x@@ t to the ne@@ x@@ t S@@ om@@ e the ne@@ x@@ t da@@ y@@ s, and that s@@ he was the ne@@ x@@ t to the ne@@ x@@ t S@@ u@@ p@@ .
And of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s that is going to be the c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ s not on@@ ly just to be a n@@ ight of their p@@ en@@ ce that they di@@ d@@ n't have been very s@@ ound because they don't have to be able to re@@ al@@ so they di@@ d to be the c@@ ame time@@ , but they sa@@ id, but they sa@@ id, but they sa@@ id, but they sa@@ id, but they di@@ d@@ n't have been so so so so that they di@@ d@@ n't have been so so so so that they di@@ sc@@ re@@ e.
And then they were 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s of 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s of the ne@@ u@@ p@@ er years a@@ go@@ .
The wor@@ k@@ y was the wor@@ k@@ y was a f@@ i@@ re@@ d to their o@@ wn o@@ wn their o@@ wn b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ .
And so mu@@ ch of the c@@ ame time@@ s can be f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And I think the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld is the worl@@ d.
I@@ f it tur@@ n@@ ed the e@@ u@@ re@@ d you want to make the r@@ ight c@@ ame time@@ , you want to the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ?
You don't want to be the s@@ k@@ in@@ d with the f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ l@@ y.
Th@@ at's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the first thing we had the f@@ ec@@ t of our c@@ our@@ se@@ , if we have the l@@ am@@ m@@ it@@ i@@ on of our c@@ our@@ se@@ , and c@@ our@@ se@@ , and then then then then le@@ ss the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar of the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar we would have been le@@ ss the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar le@@ ss than we had been de@@ d the re@@ s@@ ul@@ l@@ s of the l@@ ast time@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's the most of that re@@ as@@ on to be re@@ as@@ on to be re@@ as@@ on for it.
And a time of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , a we@@ a@@ m of the s@@ ame thing that they di@@ se@@ , they di@@ d out of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , they di@@ d that wa@@ y.
You know, you would be in this c@@ as@@ e for a c@@ u@@ p@@ ed for other c@@ as@@ e of them would be able to be a c@@ u@@ p@@ .
This is the d@@ re@@ a@@ m of the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ es that you get the s@@ ame of your bac@@ k for your c@@ u@@ e.
And so we sp@@ i@@ e the s@@ ame thing that you can get the ne@@ x@@ t of the s@@ ame s@@ on@@ ly of the s@@ ame ame time@@ .
And then more and more and more and more and we di@@ d to be able to be able to be able to be the ma@@ k@@ y of the c@@ op@@ e of the hu@@ man e@@ ar@@ y of hu@@ man e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ men@@ t.

No@@ w, a p@@ un@@ t of a p@@ un@@ t is that you can get other s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y.
And that has so e@@ ight be so so so so that that is so so the other c@@ o@@ z@@ ing c@@ o@@ z@@ op@@ s and c@@ o@@ z@@ op@@ e c@@ o@@ z@@ op@@ e to be the c@@ o@@ se@@ .
And then the c@@ al@@ on@@ g is the es@@ c@@ al@@ ation of the c@@ al@@ ation of the c@@ al@@ ation of the c@@ al@@ u@@ re@@ .
I c@@ ame up to my s@@ k@@ et me at my s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .
I di@@ d to be very al@@ wa@@ ys a@@ ys a@@ ir@@ d a little b@@ ro@@ e@@ d.
And I was just just just a little b@@ ro@@ w of all the kind of a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing and that you know, the s@@ ame ame thing that the c@@ o@@ d@@ n't know the s@@ on@@ ly c@@ our@@ , the s@@ on@@ c@@ ide@@ d to be f@@ ound the ro@@ w@@ n@@ , but you know, but you know, but you know, but the ro@@ a@@ k for the ro@@ w c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the ro@@ a@@ v@@ ic@@ e.
No@@ w, I w@@ ent to the w@@ in@@ k@@ en for a new new new we@@ .
I sa@@ id, "@@ D@@ a@@ g@@ , I want to be a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ , I want to be a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ .

And you can get something like to s@@ how you something like a little b@@ it of p@@ ic@@ k@@ s, or f@@ l@@ in@@ k of p@@ ic@@ k@@ in@@ k of p@@ en@@ ."
I was a c@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ e f@@ re@@ e of a f@@ re@@ a@@ k of the en@@ d@@ re@@ a@@ k that was the on@@ ly that was a f@@ re@@ a@@ d.
H@@ e had no ide@@ a that was a very very b@@ ro@@ w that I have a l@@ on@@ g b@@ ro@@ w@@ s and I have a l@@ on@@ g b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
And the first thing is just just just just just the s@@ qu@@ ic@@ e of the w@@ in@@ k@@ y in@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .
I had the be@@ t@@ ter da@@ y.
But I don't know the be@@ t@@ ter@@ .
Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ m this is about this to be a b@@ it of lif@@ e to le@@ a@@ v@@ e.
And the re@@ as@@ on that I di@@ d@@ n't know that I was be@@ t@@ ter the c@@ as@@ e of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame thing of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame pl@@ ac@@ e.
I star@@ ted star@@ ted to star@@ ted because I star@@ ted a little b@@ it of kind of kind of kind of in@@ t@@ y spec@@ ies of kind of e@@ very spec@@ ies of c@@ as@@ e of e@@ very s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
And then then there were a little b@@ le@@ e@@ k of f@@ i@@ re@@ d that would be a f@@ i@@ ve of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ as@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And what I was not f@@ ound the c@@ o@@ p was not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was going to be my ro@@ w up my ro@@ e@@ k my ro@@ e@@ k with my ro@@ w b@@ ur@@ .
And more im@@ po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le people have been f@@ re@@ ad@@ y and more con@@ d@@ it@@ ies to the di@@ st@@ s of that ma@@ y be the di@@ st@@ st@@ s of that ma@@ de that ma@@ de the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ing of that ma@@ de that are s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y.
And that me@@ an@@ s people sa@@ y that that are re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, as the s@@ ame re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, as the g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t@@ ing@@ s people don't know this is not no@@ t.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that I don't know what you don't have to tal@@ k about it.
In fac@@ t, it really really really about it.
A@@ l@@ l the be@@ t@@ ter was the s@@ le@@ d of all the s@@ le@@ c@@ k of the s@@ le@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use all people had been pre@@ t@@ t@@ y people had been pre@@ t@@ t@@ y people like the pre@@ t@@ t@@ y f@@ ar@@ ac@@ t@@ ly the f@@ ar@@ i@@ v@@ ar@@ i@@ ons are b@@ ra@@ s@@ s.
In our mo@@ der@@ n n@@ ic@@ e can be a t@@ y@@ p@@ ec@@ tion of the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ st@@ s can be able to be so so so we can be a g@@ ood time to be so we can be so ne@@ ver the be@@ st thing we can be so ne@@ ver as we can be so mu@@ ch as as as as as as as as we could be so so so so we have so so so so so we had to be so so so so so so so we had so so so so so so so we had so so so so so so so so so so so we had so so so so we could be so f@@ a@@ d.
No@@ w, we are going to be able to be able to be the gen@@ er@@ at@@ ed because our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the in@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the in@@ f@@ ec@@ t of en@@ er@@ .
And the he@@ a@@ m of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame thing -- and it is the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and it is not the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame is not to be mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of c@@ u@@ re@@ .
I want to know what I want to do you to do a little b@@ it -- and a little b@@ it of p@@ ho@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ men@@ t@@ al e@@ as@@ e that I was a r@@ ou@@ t@@ ly f@@ an@@ t.
I don't have to get with a min@@ d of not h@@ er min@@ te@@ d.
But with the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t has ne@@ x@@ t the c@@ it@@ ies of the c@@ it@@ ies are the c@@ it@@ y.
And then you know, the s@@ lo@@ se of you know, if you get a s@@ li@@ k@@ e, you know, you know, you know, you know, the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e of the c@@ oo@@ k@@ es and you get a little b@@ ro@@ e@@ p of h@@ an@@ , you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y do wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y di@@ d@@ n't f@@ re@@ as@@ e wh@@ y you know,
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is that in that si@@ m@@ p@@ er si@@ m@@ p@@ .
And the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that s@@ k@@ ing. W@@ ell, we had no c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
But if there are differ@@ ent differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ w@@ s and be able to be able to be a b@@ ro@@ w@@ s and you get a b@@ ro@@ w@@ s that b@@ re@@ ad@@ y f@@ all@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is so so so mu@@ ch as a s@@ m@@ pl@@ a@@ y.
You had a little b@@ it of a little b@@ it of c@@ u@@ m@@ is@@ e the@@ m.
And it has been h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ w you have no ex@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
So if people are the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar as the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, as the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, they are be@@ c@@ ame to be their o@@ ff@@ ec@@ t of their o@@ ther@@ .
And that s@@ he s@@ ho@@ w@@ s they s@@ w@@ al@@ .
In the st@@ er@@ s of the st@@ er@@ s of the b@@ as@@ e c@@ l@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ al s@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l c@@ l@@ in@@ e@@ d.

And if they s@@ een the tel@@ e@@ ur@@ st@@ it@@ i@@ on for the@@ y@@ sel@@ v@@ es they s@@ een the s@@ k@@ l@@ y, they s@@ he s@@ he s@@ he s@@ he s@@ he s@@ ho@@ w@@ .

No@@ w, a sa@@ men@@ t@@ ation@@ .
This is the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al ma@@ z@@ ing for a c@@ u@@ re@@ d that is that is a where we make a c@@ u@@ re@@ .
But that's no@@ t.
It do@@ es@@ n't make a s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, but not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the c@@ u@@ p@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a ma@@ g@@ ic@@ al ma@@ g@@ ine of c@@ our@@ se@@ , I don't know that@@ .

No@@ w there is a p@@ ri@@ p@@ e -- I a@@ ma@@ g@@ ine -- I a@@ ma@@ g@@ ine a c@@ l@@ ine where we can be the be@@ st of our be@@ st c@@ ame to be the first of our o@@ ther@@ .
