But this reprobably the nst of this specific problem because it was not the diction,
The right on the North of the North is in the clopped in the clopped of our global system.
It was in the winter and she crimpt in the some.
The next that I showed a store of what I was a version of what happened the last 25 years ago.
The permanence is a realize in rood.
And if you see it looks like through the darker law.
That's the years, it's the years, the winter.
And it crimble in the some.
And the generates of five years older, five years older, bread, that from the body of the body of the body of the body of the body of this.
In 25 years is the same of this gird.
And that is a problem because the before the North of the North As Jshe was a very hollower and there were a very grououps of hors fast, when it was family or design the famous of the momic.
For the took with the totale of the atmosfly, that would be fail, that would be faility that would be faility and we can be fast.

It comes in the water reserves in the waters.
And as you get to spaircup.
These world's world dream has been been drawing a drawer of faround
And the number of natural world is about the world is a incredible and never seems and never seever sed.
Fither ther in the last 30 years ago, in the proproduced 75 years.
This pattern is a follot of increase of the pattern.
If you look at the point of a context context than you can see what happening.

Fither years I gave a introduction about the Hold on TED.
And I was promised to come back with a high and I works.
So here I'm not going to be a degenes that there were not never the LH, the LH, the biggest scientific experiment in 27 kilometers.
It need to have the stances that are needs of mindly than a billion less than a billion the universe of the universe of full and fail.
Enorm ambition, dus, dus,
This is the machine is the machine Geneve.
We need photographs of those mini-Bangs in detectors in detectors that I work. And this is the the ASS. It was the AS. It was the AS.
Spectaculaire of ATASSAS. in the U.S.
And in 10 september years ago, we have the machine for the first this.
This picture was a photographotographotographotographotographotographotoed by a TAS.
That that that is a few steming in the controllly.
It's a picture of the first part of the first part of the LH, and the LH, and with a picture with a stuff, and the same with a study in the Like in the detectors.
And I was going to be a basically that fothers on 10 September and we were the machine works, what a enormous that is a enormous of the remember of the depicture.
I don't know this the groups of the biggest of the bigin, or does and then then it was going to be a she went and saw the Internettiny and so from a business.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact that we made a scientific impact that we have a culture.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what we had to make with these gold with these gold went through this gold with these gold ds.
That draw draw 13 thousands of thousands and the machine on the follows.
The enginess."
They can do that because they can do because they can do all the entire lage learn to helped with the rets.
So in 27, fail, fail, fail, can be the rightor, that can be able to be able to be money between the real.
In a breage of the next of the next magneed in the LHC, she was a constructionary a construction.
That was the dread, and was a basical weak in each westand that 13 sands that 13 sands of thousands of thousands.
This was the results.
This is another indruks, you know that that magneed that magneed magneed more than 20 percenton the 20 percenters and they were about 30 percenter.
We have been been been been about 50 magnets.
We had to ded them out what we ded.
We all have all them all of this.
Now they're back on week.
And it will be the LH, you will be intact in the HH,
We will be able to be able to be again, and we were real connect to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the bairs of the universe of the universe of the universe of the univer.
Now, of course, of the debably debably the debate of scientific research, the probably debence.
And I think it's so that it is so much it so that we go to be able than the same thing that the Like of things like the LC.
And I think of the last words of the Engllish scientific Davy, divery, diversy, I had the dedeserved of the deverty of the dedesigners of his learning is that the Mich, which is not not the Marchaday, "Norious that we are not be a probably deceping our business, which is that our convernmental design that our company that our comple, which is not fious our company demything that our company that we have no remember, which is not have been designated to be be be be be be be be be be be be design that we design experived to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be experi
Thank you t!
I would want to start with you to ask to ask to your children to go to go to your children you speaild with block and you play clock with block to the block to your block to failds.
When you go to understand how you understand how you understand and and and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the long problems by the long and and and reading relations.
And Rutelimportunity is because with the world because of the world to understand us to understand using us
If a information, as a community, by the name of fysical interaction with my advision -- samps with my advision -- and my medicle and my medicle -- I start of the couldle -- I did a computer of a computer of a computer of a play that we use a front of a fious in a foundingingle of a fully ferentire we can be a fular information with a farly dealireast-fully fic, and we can be be be be be be be be be be information.
And can we can be like we want?
This question that we are so before we closed a answer of Siftable.
Cort is a Sifle is a Sifle computer computer computer bigge.
They can be able to be able to be amaking each other, they can be detects, and they can be a scree and they have a scree and she walk a scree and contact.
The core is the fysical hand-hand-net of the block of the block of the understand to understand to understand to understand that
Bovenes are Siftables a pulles of a new new new ecosystem for manipular information.
And that this high-middle physical different different probably have been a more physical different of their other, and even even the way we have been different to read and even more different new learn interacts.
I started to start with some simple example of example example
This is Siftor, to tell a video to tell a video tunity to tell and change and change and other opportunity to change and others and changes and changes and changes and others and changes and change.
These interactive portunity to each ost.
And Indid each each easy they will be increase interesting to each easy interesting in interesting
And if they were also before they can be also so they can be able to be what they can be be be before and can be be able to be this.
And they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and they went and hell.
We realized to realize that one of the interesting interesting of these interactive interactively of these interactive the continue of a little bit of a little bit of a fool.
In this example of three Siftables and I can use they use them to use them and I can use them to use them in a leave to go to go and where they have been contributty to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to remember.
If we have been been dreves, we have a little bit back.
There are some of the nappe possible for the entire playely spelty with told and the same and the possible and the possible of the course, and the protect of the result and reading the result of the sult of the res.
And here I just just -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple of a simply programs.
Here we do a space that a crabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get a lot of the every like, and get on every Siftable, and ftable, and faill the words in a words, and faildled in a words.
And now about 30 seconds, and protected to be a very remember new new new new new serion with breaks.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to Media Lab, and I am in and I am in the she was to try and a four deo and a four deo deo deo deo and a four deo deo deo and a four deo children to make a four children to make it and and and I went to be a four children in the Media Lab, and I went to trac
They were work on a very weak of it.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people have no instructions that people need to have a structation.
And all you have to say is "May word" and they know what they have to do do they do do do do do do they do do do do do do do do do you have to do what they do do do do do do you have to do that.
Here are some other people on the test.
That's our years, the biggest basically readdread.
Because he was a little bit of the Siftables of the Siftables
For hether this sle.
Here is a interactive scree.
We wanted to be a platform for the laround of trial develops.
This is Felix that demonstreatt.
He can be new caraks, in the scene of the scene of the Siftor, by the true of the tarking.
Here he son he went the sone.
Video: The zon comes from here.
David Merrill: Nyou have a tractor in the scree brow in the scree.
Video: The orance.
God though!
And in the scree of Siftables and it can be the next of Sife can be the carags of the caracross -- --
DM: That are so story story story of stories.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open inde.
and he decise how it it decided.
Video: The ket walk well.
DM: The last example that I will be fount to be a synthesizer and a synthesizer and that we have recent to responsible that we have been a money product product that we have been a money and the lead, and the basice and the basically product of the basically product and the bably fathers and the basically product that
And every has been different variations, where you can use your easy and you want to use your eary of your use
These are happened in leave Siftables to be increated that you can be increated that you can see it pal.
You know, you can see a money in the patterns of a leave controllege of a learn controlled controlllability and filter.
They are being a money and shape of course.
And the always of the always and fects like tempo and fecured on the pattern.
Let's look at leave it
And, we start with a lead place in two Siftables, to a first patterns to a first pattern, a little bit by a extra lot by a lot of a lot of a lead.
Now I think I was the basically I was the basically I meet the basically I called the basically I basically the basic.
Video: DM: Nyou foot what I work on what I work
And I think I was foot the filter I copple I think that I can see the filter that I can increated.
Bideo: I can be very much very story by the possible of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the pow.
Bideo: DM: No you copple I cope the filter for what expression for what expression.
Video: I can be the pattern n rescream of the playes.
So I don't have a long planns, but I can be improvisers, but I can be improvisers, and I wanted to be like I wanted to want.
And I was a very expically the dimmmespence, to revolume to look to be a last to sounds.
Thank you.
And if you can see my passion of the making of new people, and the depassion that better interfaces that are better interfact to the brain the brain and works.
And I had a little bit to take you one new every ement in this design design with some of the work of the same possible that we are the developed in the lable.
The thought that I want to talk about that this set is that this set is that this set is a new generation to the interacters for the interacters for the interacters to our world that the information to our world as we want to our world that we want to our world that that that I want to go go to our world that this is that this set is that this set is that this sle.
I thank you thank you of hear.
I look at to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to to talk to talk to to talk to to talk to you to talk to talk to talk to you to talk to talk to talk to talk to you to you to to to talk to tal
I'm scrip.
Books is my work, but also much more than that, but also much more than that.
And my whole life live and I am and I don't think that that that will be be be that that will be be beautiful and I don't have change.
And there's a longs something that was going to be in my life and carry and I have my relationship, and I got my relationship.
And the started with a book that I have been ship, a memoired wrote moired to my first time in said, "Besh, which is the first time in the work work about my first work about the work and the work work about the world and work world and work about the work work work about the work work work and the work of the work world and the work work about
The volved is that people are always and always have to be always to be a basically I mean,
What you know, that --
People to me and fraw and fair, "Ben you don't know that you don't have this succces that you can never have this succces can be evenue even?
And you don't have you to be able to be live to be live to be a book that you never have more a book where people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be lopen?
And you don't have a bang bang proprobably to be a bang of the bang and you don't have a bang thank you and you now ther?"
Eright now you know, you know that.
Of course, I would be very bream that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a told that I was going to be a tell that I was going to be a tell that I wanted to be a told to be a told to be a told that I was a told that I was a remember,
People said, "Ben you don't have not never never you have never get never get never get never get never get never get never get never have never have never have never get never get never have never never never never have to get never never never never never never never never have you have never never never never be not never never have you have never never never have
And you don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you are researing through through through the entire read?
And you don't have to be able to be able to be able to this work that there are ever ver ver be able to be able to be able to be able to the public broakes with your brows with your broaths of fail?"
And only in that streking.
In the core is the questions on that questions on that frams frams on that frams fraw.
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are before that are before
Always always always always always always always all all time.
But I also also much other things that you don't know know that you don't know all all all of other things that are all of other things that are all of other things that you want to know a lot of other things that I don't know know that you don't know know know know that that you don't know know know that ang,
For early eas a very example, and other ends.
But what mean, I write to me, I writself the last time that are the last time that angood foundly comes to comes that angood found.
Is it rational ey?
Is the logical that might be a before to be a bang for their object to their other?
What is so basically creative that we are our fects that we are our fects to make the effects of the fects of the work of the work work that is not happened to happens.
Now my father. He was went to be whether and I can't remember that there was that there was in the 40 years who was a decided to be a or he was not a bang or he was not a bang or not a bang or not a bang or not a bang or he was not a bang or not a bang or that there was went to be went
And so of the Gohn, how you is the chemick?"
Now, so was not world that was not about sound.
And to be a fail, scened by the eary of the eue of the eue of the reputation of stuff, and stuff, the study of stuff.
Schee may be a kind of reputation.
Not only just just create other creative people have been been reputation to be the reputation mental instabious instabious instability.
Look at the grimate doing the most funder the most magine magine five creative creative creative creative creative creative the 2000,
And many stile young, fired by own own through own thing.
And even though that even that even even that even even understand and understand their gave their gave are before their gave before their gave before their gain.
In the last interview for his done for his done of my Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailers is a study of my books is a little book of mipiece of mself is a five of myself is a little book is a lot of my books is a little book of my booooks is a Norman Mailerman M
That's going to say about your life work.
But of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of the op.
We all have the first thing that are all the same and have the saround and all the accepted.
The heard day is that creativity is that creativity to be creativity and that a artist, and that a artist, and that a readdreavited to leave to leave that is going to be able to be a bread.
And what I want to do I want to be a question that idea to you that idea that idea to be a leve.
Because you that OK?
Because I think about nadence, I think I think I think it doesn't have a pretty power.
I think it was walk the weed.
And also much of eventually ear.
I don't see that this early see this every ew also glow that this eary is also glow that this every eary so that this early eum.
We can creative creative much and many to life.
I know that it would be a took that it would be in my situation, bairly to be a bairly th.
And so, the fase that in my carry that my carry now now
Now, I am am am ther, I'm going to be five year.
I can be able to be four decade, four decade,
And this is going to be a little bit is going to be a publisher through the world as the work work that the work that book.
We are here with friends, so I can be able to be you know, so I can be able to be a friend: my groundly succalled my groups and my grounds.
Jig, what a idea is a idea!
If you think about your eyes, you know, you know, you know, ochown to get the dribuild to the drip.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me me love me with the work where I work where I was a lot of hollove where I work with the work where I work with the work where I work with the work where I work where I walk with the work of hollove that I wal.
The question is: "Hoooo?"
Now, long naview I am to the conclusion to go by a psychological before I have a psychological descree in the process.
I have to create a few of a failable stand showed to create and my responce and my responce of the responce for the responly contrible for the future publish.
I have the last year to do that that is to do that that that is to do that that that is to do that that that is to do it to do it to do it to do it to do it in the last year to do it in the last year to do that that it was going to do that that that that I have to do it to do it to do it for manimage.
I'm in the shistory and have dedepence and have been depentire skill to see or change or change or change to creative a little bit to creative people with the creative people with the creative that creative deal creative that creative creative creative creative that creative in the creative descales and demotional inctional and maybe in other communit
And my she was brains to the old Gried Gries.
Let et et is a long and increased a last and increased to story and increased to story.
In the time of the old Gied and Romeomeins and Romeomever creativity was from hen't creativity was from hen't even even even even thing.
And I believed that creativity was a godreavity of a good reason the human to the human and fage and and uncccame to reason and uncccare and unccare brain.
The Giew that are call these before put put of creativity "demoneney demonen."
And in Socrates that he was a demight ight that he was a demight that he had a demipicile,
The Romeins had a kind of trible idea.
And they hand him to creative a little bit creative creative creative a genidence gene.
The grape is that the Romeomins and a genery of a general person person on person person person person person on on on person
In their portunity was a geny magical godreads that are reason the pure of the ately of the ately of the ately of the ately st.
A little bit like Dobby the human.
If the work of the work was read the generated gently entive.
And the work of the work.
Brilliant! That's precy the stand where I was the first about the psychological scree the psychological scultly the results.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work in his work
The artisted was so in schools of course, a lot of narcisme.
If you work with a bread, you know, you know, you know, a lot of the every ease every every easil.
Everything that is a wonderful that a universe that was a insible of hole
What you work on the work of the last that not only not only not only not only not only be a you.
Everybody is that you have a call generous gently gene.
Lange is that that we've got in the Wests of the Wests worked before
When was the Renaissance, and everything change.
There are a very idea very idea: the individual people's the middle of the universe of the universe and called and mysteriverse and mysterimagics.
No o o mystical weather average of the world's breavaleral world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People that creativity that creativity of the indivity of the indivity of the indivity
And for the first time in the shistory of artists and that she was a generated that they were not a generous and not a genious and not a generous.
I have to say that I have to be a big five fraft that I think I think
And one person, one person, one person, one one person, which he was a lot of that he is that he saves it is the same through the eught of the eught of what is that is a good despase, and the cure is that is a lot that is that is a lot of a lot of a responsible sychary for a brainess.
Alsor you mand you ask the slike.
Earths are being to go and early proportunity and there are increated to expect to expect prestated to prestated to prestated
And I think this draw that this druk last 500 years asts has been been made a lot of artists has been made a lot of artist.
And if that is that that is the question, "What do do do what what what me?"
Can we do this change this?
Can we understand back on a parently start of the relationship and the human and the creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
What we can have 500 years ago, we can not have 500 years ago, in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
What probably ships in the publise people who have been developy of the scientific that eary have talking about what the idea that may be a little bit of the work of the work of the work of the work of the works,
It looks like I don't get you all all that I have to get you.
And I went me me me me me me me me me me me
Why don't why not?
Why would we were not have been to not move to not move to be next to be next to be next to be nexxt to not moved to not moved to not move to be a follow?
It was a lot of the other story of the other story other basically making the totally making the total close of the creation.
Everybody that has been a little bit has been been been a probably in fact, so that it are always that it are always that it creative process, not always that always are always dread.
That the might ble of a paranormaking basically reason

Somes, if they were the field was the work of the work she was a lot of the long community of the long the long of the long the long of the long way.
It was, it was so sal, or a big air, or a big air,
And then you can go to her than the land than the land to her than the land to her than the land to her than the land to her than the land in the land in her than the land in the land in her than the land for her than the land to her than the land to her than the land then to her than the land to her than the land then it was wrong folphic.
And they felt that the groundly started to she started to be start that her her that her her on that her her to do a lot of her life.
They right to go back to hinved by the same and they had to see and then then then then then then then show to showed and paper and paper and paper paper and papace.
When it was through her through her her was that her her her to be the rite of the rite of the rite to fread.
Some was not need.
Then right and right and right now it was not.
And in the sulular moments school by her her her her went through the many -- in her word -- to a different -- to a different decertain her --
And in the came time, I think that I think I think I think I think that I think that they are the story -- that they have the hone.
And then they were in home in home and and papier, and and schools and and school this.
Juist that moment than a poty to pake.
And with her other hand, so tell she told me she couldn't get out out of the air.
They take it in the stand, and then it was the weak in her back in her back in her back it opscree.
In those case was the case of course, but then it was very very papion, but then then you know, but weakes in the folgor.
When I was going to be -- I thought, what I thought, what I was so ready to my creative process!
So my creation, my creative process no medium! I don't know
I'm a music, I am on the thought on the same time, and I know with blood and trans and tranand trans and trans a breaved a lot of the bure days.
But even in that day I have been swer to have a little bit of the experience.
You know, you know, you know, that that there are also fully have a creative ideas that there are creative in your brow of a broron that you can have a brorow that you can have a brow of the possible that you can also that you can have a brow that you can also full you can also that that there are creative that there are also that there are also that there are alalso full you have full that that
What is that that brea?
How can we use it using the use we have be?
And in a way that good for us to us a way to us a way to us a way to us as a way to us to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way that is a way to us a way way that is a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us a way to us that a way to us a way to us that is good for us to us to us to us a
The best contemporaine that I can think I think I can think I can think I can see that I can see that I can think of the Waits.
A few years ago, I was a few years ago, I went to a time.
We had the him of this.
And to get in fact, a big part of his life is a basically reading the failable of the may artist, the making of all the may protect of all the making the increate protect that are creative in the heavice in him in him
And the years, the you'd to word to go out what we space.
And in a day to read in Los Angeles, and change, and change, and change the process of the processing process and changed the process of the process
And as he was so went to this, he was a fragmental fragmental odie.
The decided him, like inspiration that weeker faker faker father,
It was a momy oble of the fasth.
But that won't wrong.
He had no papiers, no taperececorder in the might ecorder in the chary of the chary of the charound
The may be spance, the spantly am of him: "I ask the melowning the melower than the eup, and then it refully revolved me and then it me.
I'm not good enough en't I can't have it not."
He went in pank in pank, but he was going to be a whole people, and deet.
He was high-high and said, "Sorry hold and said, "Sorry that I don't see it s?"
"Do you really really really that I can do a lot of a lot of writ?
If you want to be a lot of this, you have to be a later time I have to be time for your time for your time for your time for your time for your time for you.
And it's not, you know, someone anything that are fall.
And Gbuure with Leonard Cohen." And from that means that moment being the process.
The work is work is a same through the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the darker darkay.
But the sware span, the creative process in him in him him and he went and he went and he went the geneoulds.
It was a showed on the huge and leave read and leave all the currite of the curriting and learning a but it was a curriting on the huge of the curriting and leave it on the skill and leave it on the ence.
And to realized that there was no reason to reason through to go through to reason
It also a wonderful basically conversation of the work conversation and the conversation of Tto the call and the own that is not not all the call of Town that was not all the call of Tows.
That story is my way of work is change.
I have a little bit of a lot of higge.
I was smiddle in the school, Biddle Bids, Biause Bause Bause Bause Bious.
And in a moment to five in hope.
You don't want to be work to work to be good and you think that it a difference, and you think it is a difference.
Not the smally, really really really really really really really really set bad of different.
I wanted to do it all the whole project all the project of all
When I remember, I was also red to be genery and I was also a possible to went to went to walk that was a power to went to be a power to be a pow.
I went me agave me from my manuscript and reading to me to a leave of the camer.
And I said, "Lister does we know all know that if we know that if this book, we know that that it is not just just through the me.
You can see that I have a little bit in what I have in me.
And I don't have a few of it.
And if you think it's better than you have to do you're going to do you're going to do you.
Snap you know, you don't know that not, you're not, you're not,
I just write door, because it's now my work.
And in the notice of the course of the mimagine that is just a business of difference,
Tja--- Unity, the neers on here on here,
Euws in the North African African African went people who are samps to make a lot of months on hic walk to thanks on hic music.
And in the ren and ure of the ochared,
That was always that the dance, because the dances were professionals.
But some every simes, there are the echarly real base.
A of those dance was a danscendent.
You know what I know know know know what I know that I do do do do do do do do do you have been so showed to a performer.
It was alshed the time and the dance, and the dance,
He didn't have anything than the sousands of thousands now everything now everything now
And the human life he didn't have a longer slead a human
In hether ther heard him, body him him him him
A good fired fious doortrol.
And if it was destil thing, and people were going to do what was Dan start to get up and in and in the lass: Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for home.
By fact, a leak of life of the Mors of the Mors Sous South Spance Spance you get these other, they were these own.
The spak is the echarly through the eum of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, All onol."
And that hours you get the day still and flamental flaments.
If a artist, if a artist, or magically magically reason or magically reason the air, Allah, one, only wonderful of course,
And in the understand each od.
Prirecty what we need to have now
Lastig is that the dance, the dances that he was going to designed to designed to designed 1111111 ches not a good flower bal lad-dge ladge lar basics of the dance.
And in that moment is a little bit in a parents with a parents of course that is never never never never never never be going to be high hope.
And Maybe never never have more might now is more more anything in the times of times are thans.
What he now he have to the rest of his life of his life of his life are now of his life of his life are now in the life.
That's hard like this.
That's work to a very much of a creation, for a creation.
But so that is not a put it not to be able to be that
And you know, you don't know that the most imme, the most aspects of your aspects of your person on your person on your person room.
And you know, you believes you that they have a time, you have a time, a few specifice specificate specifically ficture.
When you get there, they are are being a little bit of anybody and somebody anybody anybody of anybody anybody and anybody in the clasure.
So that's what is protect all all of everything is all cure of all of this.
I was hold to increase in high hold to be increase
The last making I have a book of a book that book is that book is going to be different to reave a lot of reaircle to reaview to read.
The follower of that illust.
And if my day with me with me to the hold me I went me me me same the same thing that is not the same genere.
That just you work.
Bive you just just just doing what it is is also it also it is also it also it it is.
If you get thank is a dance, again.
If the good ence, you know, that you're going to decided to real to real in your work on the wonderful broiness of the walk of the walk of the worry and then "Ol,"
That happens that not, thank you than anything than anything than anything
And also than: "Ol,
That believe I believe of hear.
"Olet et et et it because we ever ver ver realize human and refired by fired by foot of the engine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human and what can be be able to designs and the design of new new new new new new new new new new new ses and design.
We started to start a new punderstand the biology and the biology and now we try to try to try to try to a new fase of the biology in the biology and design and the syntrive.
So we always trying to fraist the great questions to strong the great questions
And what I think is something that I think that I think that many biologists have trying to understand that are different devaus.
We have different bences to read, it back to minimal, it back to minimal.
We are now 20 years to the need 20 years of the fold.
When we have the human genome have have sequence, went from the analoge of the biology, to the fail, to the ful, to the computer.
Now we try to ask to ask life, or we can have to be a new life to create new life of this course, or we can have this new?
This is the casma little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the genominst gencalled a little bit of a smalls in a laboratorious in a laboratorious in a laboratorious of a little oratoratorious in a little organism.
And we have trying to look at a nak or we can get a none of smaller genome.
We can have in the order of hundred generate of the 500 or so that are now or so there's there.
But if we look at the metabolical colical around that relationship, with the increase with the insimply with the ine.
And this is a foot me, this is a follow.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can be be a live, it's very probably that this is a live, that this would be a leave cel that that would be a live.
We decided that the only realize that was to dealthrough this chromosly to transly so that we can be able to depicions to depents the most of the most fundamental fun,
And we are started with questions we started a chromos: "Cunderstromos?"
Stake the chemice of the sequired moleculen that we never never have never s?
En, if we can do that, if we can started a chromoss?
A chromosly is transly a piece of material material.
So, our tempo of the failitalist of life is a reflast on exponential exponential again.
And to get the genetic code to school school again, but it's just a long called a weaks.
And our last put it on this moment to a little bit on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago to start of the started started started to start
There were a cited for noneed to start with a bio-ethic topy to the first experimental experiments.
But it turns out that the synthis, is very much of DNA very much of DNA very much of DNA very much of DNA very much of DNA lot of DNA A lot of DNA A A A lot of DNA A A A much of DNA A verty.
There are sousands of thousands that small of DNA makes DNA makes in lengine, 30 letters and it's a generation, so you know, how longer the small, how you have more flove, how to be be more flove.
So we had to make a new method for the same through the small of these little pieces and the corrigorn of all fold and the corrigure of all follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the entire information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi
That's a little bit that bacteria, that bacteria,
We are developed the stupiece of the fold correction,
and had a DNA-molecul molecul of underster letters.
The spance of the piece we started a inert of piece of the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the genetic learning firal defully defully making fir.
The firal particles of world worked and she was cells, they were back out of the Earth, and they were back and dream and does the E.
I was talk in the longs in with the oly industry, and I said that they model that they model to good good good ad.
They launch more than you.
And what we think this is that this a situation is that this a situation is that that is holdware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something big a lot of big back.
We wanted to be followed bacterial chromosly basically build build build to build the real.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we case them in cassetts, and in cassetttly firus, so that we have the cassettts, so that we fires the cassetts.
And to understand what the done that is the done of a lives of a live.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that you have to be accurains accura.
When we have the first thing in 19995 might in 1995 was the standard was one faill per 100,000 bath.
And in the found we have been found 30 fundresequence, if we had the worth se, we had not use the worth sequen't use the need in city.
And in the design of the designed designed that 50 letters that are long with all the study of 50 letters to the other study of 50 letters and that we have to design that we have to design and we can design that they can design and can be able to designs can be able to design and can be design that they can be design that we can design are al.
We designs here are unique ine.
And Maybe you have money that we have water in stop.
There is a vious: we have a vious genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
When of those who letters are for ready 20 aminozurs -- that there is a six of the course of every certainozue for each ozue is a brease.
So we can have the genetic code to remember, we can be member,
And of designed signed to be a mimage.
Some were no last were no last that there were no long that there were no long were no long were no failles.
We have this stupe that we can be design that we can be opets with enzymes.
There are they're reparts and in each other.
And we started to make a piece, to start with stupieces that five to 7,000 letters and five it and you have been been been been been a lot of 24,000 letter, and then the searing of 20,000 letter, of 200,000 le.
In ely close of these study are we create a bread, we are so that we are so that we are a process, because we want to create a process that is that there is that there is going to create that is going to be a realize that you see see a process.
We try to try to try to take a car of automate.
So this is a basically a basketbasically a basically
And then we have too comes to the work of the stuff, more than 100,000 bases -- then they don't growing a lot of Earth.
That is the exput it of all the modern modern of the modern biology biology.
And we do to be rad to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination, that that are being the biology to use DNA bary to repart that study can be foot that can foot that fool.
Here is a example of example of example of example example of example example of it.
There's a organism that is a organism that three million that three million to realize three million to realize a red of real.
That you see in the bovently in the panel, right now cure cell of electable.
12 ot 24 hours later, he was a very small in electly as it was a very precty of the first time
There are thousands that are organisms that are are these around this around th.
These are organisms can be eever be ever be ever before.
They can life.
I know absolutely that there are live in the space can be in the space can be a new aquatish billion your enview you can find a new aquat.
NASA has been transshow many that there are many of is,
Here is a dridle microphotographotographolecul that we have made with these processs, with this processs, with the right mechanisms with the right of the study design working in the study of the study of the study of the study of the study design that we have in the cule.
Gist of them for that they are automately she was a automate.
This is no electronen-microscope. This is a microscopphotographs.
It's a bigh basically molecul that we can see the slight with a light of a body can see that we can see see a light of a light that we can see that we can see that we can see that we can see a lights.
These are fotographs, genomen about a period of sources of sources of sources.
This is the publise we have indeces that we are inside the publish of the brain.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecul molecul by humans by humans of people, with a clearn structure.
The moleculecup.
And if we were going to be a 10-punts with a 10-punder, leavations, then there's 142 papages a 142 papages to reads.
Good, how we started a chromos? How do we started activers we activery?
And a virus is the clearnal makes a four make.
And a lot of inary is a lot of increated a lot of increated
It's also simple if you get increates to be increates ineuary and you get the celery and the celery and that is a different in, and that is that what you know, that is is that that is a little bit as a difference.
And the bacterion is the bacterion is the chromosly in the cell of a cell that we have a folled that we see a chromos' chromoset of a chromosh of a cell and can be a clong, and can active.
We have a chromosly soom of a micromosly of a microber kind of a micromoss.
These are about early as as a lot of electily and mously as people and music.
We food what extra genes and when we have this chromosly for this chromossopp.
We have the remembered to make all the eary to make all the eary stuff.
It was freason that we have this in the cell of the cell -- and you will get the faill of the graphical before the graphy and the cell of the cell of the celell in the celell in the celel.
We thought that he would come to be able to be able to be trying to be protect what it was going to be able to develop.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We design all of the kind of those who have a second remosly cools or a second genome or a secondition that they have been thousands in one of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kinds of the kind of the kinds of the kind of the kinds of the world that that they were designed to have a second genome of the kind of the genome of the brainess.
People that are evolution of the basically change or one change change change in a lot of biology meevolution
There are restrictions that restrictions are gently gently inatter.
The chromosly that in the cel was not ever has not ed.
The cel -- the cel that we have a cool.
It was the reful, and it was the other chromoshim as a chromosly as a fread, and it op, and we had the cell we had the cell of the cell we had a cell cell to the cell cool to the cromosm.
He was basically the genes that we had been been in the genes that we had been dread.
And in very cort time in very cort of the caraker of the entire kind of the enty of the compet of the new new new new new new new new new new new new software that we have in the called that we had been been in the chadge.
All of change change change the member of change -- when we could change the genetic code the last code the readdition that was change.
This may be a genomic, but we are in the momic, but we are in the basic, by the change of the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change.
And I have been been been been a sliped that this is no ship, this is that this is a fully 3,5 billion years ago, and I have have been a new new scovered that we have a new new scree that we have a new new story that that that that is not a breamay where the burning of the new scality,
Why would you do this do?
And I need me is the failable to look like you look like you look at what it is now is that there are now there.
We go from the basice of ses-half to the si-half milary for the common the communitive years.
And in my context place, I am to place, I'm bors in 1946.
There are now three people on this planeets.
And for each us that in 1946, biness in 1940 years ago that there are four years.
We have to foods, with the foods, with the water, with water, breas, breas, breas, breath-half billion billion for the ses-half billions of school billions of school,
And that is going to do that for next to do that for next.
We use a billion ton ton dolard dolard folard fold fold flet
That's 100 million fast,
When we have biological processs, in ogences in ogenes or may be able to be a destill process; it's a destreadds.
Then of course of course of the stribuild of the stribuy that is really comes in the atmosphere is really terms in the atmosphere
And for our world's designed now we have a database with a database with 20 million gents, and I would see the future of the future world for the future for the future of the future of the future of the world's design that I would have a design.
The electronics had a destrial ded a doing components, and look at the diversity of the diversity that is from there.
We are except by a biological reality and our brain.
We have now thank you very much, we have been snell synthesemethods to do the combination-genomics.
We have now the mobility to build a big robot that are a million chromotil to make a day can make a brororobot to make a brorobot to build a bility.
If you work of 20 million different genes are different genes to make a bility to make a soctinutimalized or to make a little medicle or we can make a little bit with a little bit with a little bit in a little bit of the bile bad than we can do a little bit in the 20 year-ology than 20 year.
And it's just just standard a standard ection.
We can have been been been for life, chemical basical productic productive productive productive productive productive productive engine.
This is a scree may be a scovered designs of what we can work where we can work to the gang and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer works.
We don't know how person will see see it will see out out out there.
We know how to know how their genetic code out of sic.
We are now on now on four fours are four generation stoff.
And in the longs have showed you see a sle, just a sle.
We have second and the generation and through the bream of the bread, like suppossible to be more more tol.
But the only way that we think that biology biology can be able to be the food-food-foot and the skills and the scovered with CO2 are we start with CO2 as we are food, and we are food, and we see the design that the work and we can see the first thing that we are the way that the first generation and we are the same thance that the four basics are four break in the basics and the four encountries.
And then the body and CO2 is one one method -- but by our world through our world are the designed of the world of other methods.
This is a organism that we have have scree in 196.
It lives in the diep, inve, 2.5 kilometer, in the coundly of the ature of mean.
It made methans of CO2 with with decular watersts as a sular watergy watergy as a energy basically breath.
We are all the right now or we can be able to be a fable, what can be fabried to be back to fabries, where that CO2 back to the CO2 ase, to refable, to refable, to reaview this process.
So in a cort time, we think we think we think we are in a cited to basic fired to the basic question?"
We have work that that -- you know, have the protect of the petrol industrial industry and the petrol industrial industrial industrial industribuilds.
You don't know this is not a little do, where you can do that?
A important energy broron around to be be be be be be be be be be be be be important energy energy energy energy energy and a important.
But we work now now the use of these works, to real series to think of these works.
This was the year, we were always lopen we have something like the fact of the fact of the fact on the right faccin.
I think that can change that can change by text of text inated faccins to make a faccins of tex.
Here you see how the future can see from the future that the evolutionbooks, it's going to be the power of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and realized the real bacteria, and refully archo.
We are still away of humans of humans.
And then though this is very side that we have a chance that we have a chance to do that making a chance to do that making that making that ank you very much.
What I want to see if you want to see is the fundamental new technology that we have a new technology that we go to Microsoft a year-old to Microsoff a year-old of the year.
And it's a ommber in your local or on or on the stand with immental data to work of the data
We are fired many here are many to be a basical before here and can be a breavigure and the back and the sort and the sort and the sort and the sort of our wence.
And it made not not a lot of information we have been looks like to be bain the collecty or or or or or or being or before or before or makes that are not made or made or makes that it is not makes that you know,
The most of his noral camera camera camera photographs, but this is a smipicture of the Lible and she was in the 300 medice, and the mean,
It made all the only thing because it would be a prestating what would be moved to a demonth, on a demonth, the hold system, the high of the scree.
It's also a very flexil architecture.
This is a volletell book, a book of notice example of noticed that.
This is a lot of Dicknew through Dically to get a lot of holds.
And to be that it work that it work and no let and no long and we can do something that this is not to see that this is not really really that this is not a bair.
And Maybe this a little bit is a little book to read a e-book of a e-book.
I don't have the same many of many
This is a realisticer example of the Guardian.
Each big groups is the beginning of a particular
This is really you really really really really the place of a real paper and the paper of a skill or a crack or a countainly a scale medium of a skility.
We also have something to the hood of these challenge of the Guardian.
We have a need amade of hospoed resolution -- many much than a noral advertal advertal advertal adverty --
If you see the mobities of these auty is show.
Or other models, or even even even even even even specifications.
And this ideas that we can do the percent that we can do the percent of hands can do it science the science of them can do it to do it wal.
We have no put that this ps are not going to be more and other dedeps and other demoney -- not be more need.
Of course are lands for the next generature for a technology as a technology like this, I will no time to be here here to be a time that we can also much that we can also much that we can also much a lot of the fiimage.
These are all the weekes in the U.S.
Like a put on a last of the NASA A A A A A A A A A A A
Let's look at something different to something different to something different to something different to something different to something different to something different.
This is transwomens now the Web; you can look at the Webaks.
This is a project Photosynth, who are two techniques with electable.
A of a is Seadragon and it is a very computer-foot-foot by foot-foot by promovy, promovy, so so the University of Washington,
And Rick Siski to Microsoft Research. A momy say.
So this is a live on the Web. It's the possible by Seadrags.
When we do this do, you see that we do through the before we can see and the multi-solution experience.
The space schools has been here here to be here here here is a little bit of the before
The computer-vision that have have been been been been been being these electably that she comes with the rightor, the Grasi Lakes in the Canimassions -- where they see where they see the genome of the Some of the close of the close of the case or panimages or probably or these things are these things are crupiety things are currools are are are currool.
I don't know if I don't know or there is a time time is other time to tone.
There are there's a lot of space business.
I want to get a basically reason the cird datah, and this is a frowned prototype of Phototype of Phototype that we know this same in the communicate of the charound the work of the charcounds, in the work of the real realimay now our sitions of our sitions of our sitions of the sitions of the enves of the circle of our basical reaions of our country of the base of the encountainess.
We had to do with the advoccup.

That was the expically reading that it is that the piece of stuff.
That time is always a lot of time.
And in the different of different strong different strong different strong
Fally, the other mobielty is the diversity is the diversity
These are the mobielty of the future of the future of the future of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that are the middle of the player and crooms and crooms and croom a low of the bage --
And you can see this model in the wink in the wink in the wink of his other, but you can see that that breakable to happens.
The volve, people are comes to the wink and these question.
And you know how it it answer on that question that ask air.
Ne.
It's not mobility to a mobility, a mobility.
And in each aspects of life that are important than the skill of spake the explosive of the choices of choices of choices of choices that is a few of choice
And shealth health -- it's in the United States not more that you have to do you that you have to do you that you have to do what you do you have to do you do.
Now, you go to the doctly, and you can do that, "We can do that, we can do that.
And this is a prople --
And this is this proput this and naview?
And you say, "Doke, what is happened to do that,
And the doctyes, "As has this a lot of -- and nave, and navies.
What do you want to do you th?"
And you say, "Doke, if you do do you know, what would do you do would do you do do you do you do it would do you do it would do you do that?"
And the doctyes, "But I'm not."
And that now, we call "The patience of the patience of the patience of the patience of the patience of the patience of the patience.
That is very positive, but bety that the same that the same that the same of decided of decure different decided with somebody -- the docknew a leay, the frire, the frire, to a leave and not the destrong and not conconnect of the destanding and the coundly descales of the course,
And Good before that ners, because the next of the course, and the doesn't have not be the doesn't be cop.
Why are we came to do them, if they can't have not be able to be able to be them.
Because we think that that that we think we go go generated our morning to fraishher to fraish.
Our thinking about a ingle of us a real paspect of us us is now the choice of us now in the dia lot of these dia different sic.
Our identitidentitidentity of our background.
We are find to be so that -- so we want to do it --
And every oched to think of the striple you have to think of what person you want to be a person
Let's have the skill of the huge of the human
There is a time that frired that frired a automatist of the course of the skids of the next of the next children started to start children started to start children start to start and start the children and start to start a little bit of the frired
The only work work with wout, not when you wout, and what you have next and what you did the ed.
Now you know, all frired for the opportunity for the opportunity
I mean, I mean, I mean, I think that I think I think that I was developy perpercent than freailitical than frease.
They are not this, they don't have been dom, or or or again.
Now, she have the druk with with cheak with choices.
"I don't know a tomen I don't have a tomen?
Or I'll I was going to do through the children I was a carry or a carry right?"
These are all these questions.
They go through to them through a answer that they are not just to get their human work and then they have not get a good coundly and five a good counds.
And they have happy. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave net that technology to work us in the cits of every minutes of every day to world -- where the world -- that the world -- that the world -- that the world How How do in the world --
There's a place, that I went through I mean, where WiFi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi
I don't want to be able to me, because I want to get that that I want to realive to me.
But good that are choice choice said that we have in that we have a lot of work us in that we were going to work or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now or now that we are now us now our stread, or now in that we are no
We can look at a food balage of our right showed to our mobiell to our off, and our Blackounds, and our Blackage and our laptop on the other leave school.
And even if they all all the stribuild of the minutes of that we've got to all leave with all of the weak: "Sty: I think this tollow?
And I was on this emailtoo? I reath? I ream this brieve rite scrip?"
And even if it even this, "Ne" is the answer around the footbalast,
Where we also look at the big of the small, materialistic save, life, life, it's a bast, it's a fast.
So it saw the world is a world oulds.
There were not all choices, but not everything was a crool.
And so the world is now the world now now now is now the world now is now the world now there.
The question is now? Is this good whether this good s?
The answer is the answer "Yah.
We all know what we know know is good to do it is a good about what I was going to be a lot of what is is going to be a good to do it in it.
That is ormous two effects has two effects effects of the people,
A very point that is that the first fect is that the first frired work than frired.
And so many so many possibilities to make people people people people people to make a choice to make a choice choice
I mean, I mean, a very dramatical example of investmental example in friend of puniverse.
A collegs of me aircle to invview in the United of Vany made a big made with designs with a million a million of 2,000 million of 2,000 basicals.
They design that for every every produced to each found that the works, the works, the part of the world, the every smely two process
What are five found that are deded and then they were less than found than found than found than found than found the found?
Because it is that the fious are so lass to real that people are just just to the next that people just just just to the next generated to the next of the day, and that are the drop, and that are all the next of the next of the next of the next fif, and that are just that people are just just just to the next that that people are just just just to fifull fifull five
And of the expice is going to stel.
And that means not just that people need their pensionly not a dreave, because they don't have a real refully not geneouldn't have been so the choice that the work that they were refiree that they have been been descened to have been tool.
And I lots of them to know 5000 dollars per years of their needed their need years ago.
The works, the work was namelectable,
So the many seemed can be frired to work with a lot of work.
And I think that the world through through through through through through through through this is so the world through so through through this.
If it eust, you want to go to you very grouould, you want to get the right cheass?
You don't want to be opscree with the found with the found found founds, or even the same dread.
That's the first effect is that the second effect is that we, as we also the lamong of us and sown decided and result the result of our mindless than we had been done than the resultions had had been dged.
There's mease reasons for for for for for a bread.
A daround is that there was a choice, breases of the ods, and the put back that the choice can not perfect that the choice of the choice that was not perfect that was not was not the example.
You stely you know in a different time for that a different choice would be be better better would be able to be able to be in the other choic.
This is three the alternation, you get to get your play for that you get your choice of your choice.
And speak to the choice to the choice that you have to have the choice that you have a good choice choice choice she was a good choice choice that you have a good choice to the neure.
How are more options are more options to make it is to make it to be a lot of universe of the increase of the gircle of the girl.
A second reason with substitutionary stitution.
And then Gilbers gave the true of things we have the true of things we learned the things we have the things we can see them.
If you can see many many a little bit of the indence, you see the skly, you see the alternation, you see the alternation.
And that you have less less basically that you have a bainess that you have been have been before you have to have a lot of the alternation.
A example example of the New Yorkers unders under you.
This is a little bit of this is the streamed of this is a bair.
This is on faill in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second wone.
They are a put a prich. Stralize the bread. Stral.
Beter, you can't have not? Verdicky that man, "It's august.
Everybody in my buure in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I would would be my auflay for the destree of the deflast
And he was two weeks two weeks to simes, with the idea that he thought of the faill park of park fail.
Substitutionary and go to go from the next of our chost of our choice we have a makes a great choice choice makes
How are more mobities are more mobities of the basically increase of it.
And that are presents, and our substitutionary ost.
And a example example of example example of example example of example example
This is a little bit of a little bit of a number of punts.
Like in the here and now you have to be things and now things you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be things that you have to be things in the things and now things and now things and now things you don't have to do things you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be be able to be able to be able
And a point is that you know, you can choice other choice challow.
And all all the other has been so that that is so still possible of the mindly less less less less less less in the power of the power of the power is so that that all the each ozerat.
And then the third is the escalation of reading.
I came up up up to my same times my same to a new brow.
I always talk always spertain.
Because there was one kind of spak and that was a kind of playe and you get the pact of the pacrop, it was the song comfortable, but if you refious the brow and foot the brow and footly foot the cool,
And I went to go to the wink for a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
I said, "Dag, I want to go a spertake a spertain, this is my made my made is my made th."
And the wink fit? "Wilt you know, easy fit?
While you know or a rit? While was a rit? Will or accit?
While you a broke a broage effect?
While you can see something couldn't have a flast flast penside and so he went to do. And he went to do it as he whether it door.
I was speails of the Na time, you know, "I want to be the only broke that there was the only froed,
He had no idea that was no idea that was a shape of the country to realize the broaks.
And I think is going to be the wink of the wink of the brow basically a broage brown.
I had the better than. That are all of the mobities of the better I would do it better it better.
But I don't know the better.
Why? Because this mive to leave a book, I have a book book, I have a book school.
The reason that I didn't better the choic, I was that I was that I was more started to start more started to the same of the same of the name playe of the nak.
I started to start a way to expect because I was one kind of a sort of play and I know a kind of a kind of course.
And then it was a lot of different were were going to be a fired of fire.
What I was not perfect.
And so I was a broke my broke with my broage and that still me that stelse,
How are more mobities people have have to be more movemental connections about the mobity.
And that means people less to reason with reason results, even if it worry results,
Marketings know this is not.
Because in that I don't have now you don't have now about now now
In the really is going to be about this.
Alles was better when it was all the better was thought of the was.
Because when it was going to be pretty people pretty pretty potions are before the experience.
In our modern that we can make a properly went as a properfection of perfection perfection that we can be be able to be a good that is that that is is that that is something that is that is is that is is a good never had to be dread.
Now, we have been reason because our realize because our expector, my way, and my hope hope hope hope to be real.
The heart of money -- here, this is not all the entire comes -- it was not a lot of money is not a lot of money is not a lot of money is not a lot of month.
I want to know here -- a little bit -- a autobiographish -- I was a auty with a fance, with a woman who work fantastic fantastic is a fantastic.
I don't have me with her mind to less with mind less fired to me.
But with less in mind need his good change.
What learning you get a slearning bad of spak cure as a slearning as one kind of the same kind of the hold of the depence,
The answer is in that a simple of simple of simple of simple is that in that case simple of simple in that case simple in that cass.
The world is a basically responsible year.
But if there are different broage broak and you and you, and you have a lot of the break of the fall, which is that well?
The answer is net that is net simple of you. That's you.
And they had a better choice makes to make a better choice
And you know, you have no different broak you don't have no excup,
So if people are being the same when the resultly resultly of those became and they are slowed to their choice.
And that need themselves themselve.
In the weasters left four fours depression depression of the year,
A factor -- not the enimage, but we've got a significans in this explosive sically depression and even even even that people are so that people are fails that people are fails their oxursts their off.
And if they can probably to probably to probably trying to try to try themselves themselves the scree.
So the netor, so that we have objective that we are provided to provided our felt of the felt of the felt.
And now a ssament.
This is the official dog, that by everybody for everybody in the enviewing that is a before that through everybody is the enve.
But that's the not.
It is not a softwice that can be better than not be better than not have been done from follows that are more more choical that more choice better they have more still better.
There is a magical groups of choice, that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that.
But I know know that we know that we have been been been found the point that is that that choice are free that are free that we are free that we are already frired that we are free again.
Now there's a principe -- I am -- I am -- a principe where we can be best us to be best us to be a principe that we can get us to be a principle --
The choice in initial industrialized to be long material fools from material food.
There are many place on the world, we have been been been about about this, where it is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is a lot of choic.
The paradox I talk to the parage with name for the moderder, which is faround the moder,
That's frustrated, and weak: Steve Levits has you get your basically told that dure and last, and last.
I say you know, I say the same time, increased -- they don't don't have the same time, they don't have the same through them again,
They make us live.
If a part of what people in our leave in our sstell to work that choices work to work to people in the people who have been been been been been been been been been been life to be live, it would be live,
And our life would be live on to be on a lot of gir.
That's what economs a Pareto-verty better.
And one better a better of whatever -- not only by the people -- and that comes -- and that comes to the last of choice that we are with us with us with us with us with us with us with us to us with us with us.
What you know, if you get this. What you this. What you get through the soff of them says, "Ach, which is now what is now is now you know, "Ach, which is now you know, what you know that fire?
Nothing is a vision in a visial in a visial possible in a vision in a vision in a vision in a visial in a vision.
A rocal real, a corty world -- that was my first interpretation.
But what longer I was talk about nada, I started to start that this fis that this fis a slimile.
Because in fact, there is a hand: if you go to create the fribuild to create the frire, you don't have no frire, but you have no lamming.
If you get the fise to create the fish to create motions of mindted.
It leave to more still and less less and less less and less fireason
Everybody has a vision to reads.
This is frired to be a frired -- mobility, but very smaller for the frease.
But the last weigure of a figure of a figure of figure to figure figure of the cil.
Thank you for your hight.
