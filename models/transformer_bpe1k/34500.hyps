And last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar cape cape that the last three million years about the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United S, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United S
But this distinction is the worst of this particular problem because it is not the disect of the ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crinks,
And the next slide I shows a very speed version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dividual.
And as you see it from the dark blue; it looks at dark,
That's the year's winter.
And it crinkling in summer.
And the so-called ice, five years or old-age, almost like flowing the body, that from the body's body's body's flowing here.
In 25 years of it is to this in 25 years of this is to be in 25 years.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground the North Ice-warming Icelebrate and there's a very large amount of frozen carbon dom, when it is designed by microbes ded by microbes in methane.
Conarea of the total high-reinvention in the atmosphere, that could double the amount of the amount of the amount of the course point to the close point of the catmospace of the amount of the atmosphere.
In some of the understanding Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey winter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska team to another team to another team to another team before.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real to be that are going to be that are going to be that.
A reason for that, is that this enormous called warming warming Greenland from the north.
This is a smooth of a smoothrough this.
The water than ever before is bigger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuage in South west Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because it is the landice because it is the landice where it comes in the sea.
These strains flight to be flightly to it.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, on the side of the planet,
And the last month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance balance is fired to it.
More specifically is the ice of the south of the south of the south of the south islands.
The whole continent is six meters of six feet of six payrole.
In Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass, there are now new now, there that were new now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water from that mely melt time.
In the Andes, this glassing the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more straight now.
But when they disappeared, it disappeared,
In California was a four-in-felt percent in the snow.
It's a terreally coming in the water reserious reservers.
And as you could read it, are the predictions of them are the predictions of it.
This global dred dred to a dramatic stye fired to a dramatic global fires.
And the number of nature, crams around the world is subject and never never seen accidental and never never seen fast.
Four more in the last 30 years of the last 30 years in the forgovernment.
This pattern is completely intention.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 hours of CO2 hours.
25 mios tons every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a dragical drift dragical dance, there's a draw.
The only great cause of the Earth, is of the Earth, which is designed for 20 percent money is money for 20 percent money is fossil fuel of fossil fuel of the Earth,
On is a problem, and step is a problem, and it's the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest chausians with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more step of more step centrals.
But we see a bit of a course.
These are the voice carbon that the building was annuled in the last year and where green alternatives were proposed in the last years.
There's a political battle on the country.
The voice carbon and oil industire gave industire 250 million dollars to promote character.
And that image me to something think.
And, the chair was home in Tennessee, about four billion liter cleard billion liters of believed before
You probably have seen the news.
This is the one-largest display in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the urban lindustrial around the Kerster was this one.
Video: "Wey-cleman being the voice guy is a stay holds.
He's a flengineering here in America, and he makes it before our economics.
Frosty the voice chota cleman becomes with the day.
He's paid and cutband, and called their job."
Here is a big part of the urban area of the urban in West Virginia from day.
The largest mine workers of the country is the great bay of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Ree, they don't know where they talk about."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touched campaigns on touches.
This is a piece of this.
And so, "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatened for our things.
That's the reason why it's the most important purpose is to give a giant thing to admit to address the light and the letting of the light and the letting of the truth of truth and the truth of truth and the truth of truth and the truth of truth and the reason why it's the
Fits is not salkied is not smar.
We think it's clean -- and it is a clean -- and it is still a clean.
So, you don't make care about climate change.
Let me just that but to us us us to us this.
Video: Acure cool, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean city-critical countral.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit best a little law.
But that's the sound of clean urban technology.
And despite the fact that burning the fact that burning is one of the most important causes of the Earth, change the earth is the remarkable course, the remarkable of the editory that you see here.
Look at good around this, this is the clean coal technology today.
Al Gore: Einvinally, the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that on the area of national security.
Video: America is in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red rod is to all these bags, our dependency of fossil fuel colls, like pole colls, and inmported oil.
But now there is a small of the new solution to this.
And the America of 100 percent clean electricity inside 10 years.
A plan to get America to the work to the work is a plan that makes us makes us to make the earth of the Earth counter.
And eventually an solution that is just enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last stread.
Video: Stem: It's about America. It's re-a-power to give energy.
And one of the fastest ways to make a dependent on our dependence of old folding the planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 22: New investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speak that says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go again.
We have to go far and far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave an introduction a LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here, I am here. For those who were not the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever experiment ever experiment ever experiment ever in the side.
It has to do the conditions that were presenting that were less than a billion a billion of a billion times a second after the universe of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, so, thus!
This is the machine Gengine Gengine --
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diame.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in agricular so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party care of a party.
It's a picture of the first particle that is all the the LHC went around the LHC went around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, by a piece of the LHC, and with a particles in detector.
In other words, when we had the picture that picture 10 September we were working on the machine worked on the machine worked on it.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of this, or then, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden wear.
And those behaviors 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power on full force.
The engineers are you'll say, "Not where. They're too little draging."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superceive on whole temperated.
So on multi-ey-17, than the space between the stars, who can take the stars, that can draw break that flows behavior.
In one of the neine between nine thousand maggnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was something that was a little bit of a long one was a little bit of the against that 13 thousand ample that 13 thousand ample that 13 thousand ample that was 13 thousand ample of it was a thousand ample of it was a thousand there's a thousand there was a thousand ample of it was a thousand ample that was a thousand there was a buntil of it was a three of it was a thousand there.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realizing you that magnets more than 20 tons tons of the tons of 20 tons of inches over 20 centimeter.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of them, what we did do.
We all have partly.
Now they are back to away.
Eind might be the LHC again.
We'll put it again, and we expect it in June or Juniverse or the right look at what the building the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe to be again, and expectly to the same out of the universe to the building of the universe to be again.
Now, of course, that have been able to debate the debate of the value of science. It's easily. It's easy to research. It's easy to work on the value.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so much hard to be beyond to be beyond to be things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientish Humphrey Davy, I did the defence, I did destributed experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this said, "No is so dangerous than the human spirit of human minds of the images of the human mind in the world, and that there are no respirite in the nature, and that there are no completely completely that there are no complearning that there are no reading in the dicourse, and that there are no experimenty."
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your childhood and when you play with block and amazing.
And then you discovered how to grade grade to grade graduate and aware and aware your own problems by learning the device relationship with and depended with the depended with and of space relationships.
Rum is insight is a stronger because of the world to understand us.
If an information -- inspired by the nation of physical interact with objects -- together with my advising advising Pattion and my fellow fellow Jevan -- I started to ask a computer -- I started to ask a computer -- what if we use a computer in that one mouse is a kind of a digital fingeral fingeral reauthoration that moves a moves that moves information in a place that moves information is going to information that we could figure out of information that we can figurve the hands information with a movital fingerate with both information and fingerated a movital fingerate with body eles;
and orders can we ever want?
This question to this question that we decided to search a response to search a building the building of Siftables.
Cort together is a Sift a interactive computer in size of a cow of a cow of a cookies.
They can be able to ship with the hand they can do together their movement and they detect a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade, as blocks they can be moved by graving.
And in the top of the course, Siftable, a new ecosystem for the manipulate of digital information.
And thought this resources have a more physical different of their movement and even of their movement and even of the way we movement and even of the way we move, they're moving new and figure out.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sift: This Sifty is to show a video that plays, which plays, and other sheets and other shed behind playing to play back to play behind the show.
These interactive portraits are awareness of awareness.
And indicated together to each other, they will interest.
If they are reversed to be surround, they can be able to become a little nervous.
And they feel a movement and helling.
We realized algave that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction, the use of the interaction, like it was a color like it was a fluid as it was a color like a liquid was a fluid to a color as it was a liquid --
In this example three Siftable, and I can use them to use color in a fairly crazy in a leg time they get color in a leg --
If we have drive, we go back to what back.
There are some capable of the educational possibilities for the education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility that people want to give things fast. And the result of the result of the education of the education is to see it.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple calculating programmatic programative.
Here we show you a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single to get a rare, every Siftable, and send did words being controlled in a dictionary dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is being a 30 seconds is a new series of letters to hear a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm indicated to make it it out to make it out of a video and make a video and there's a video and there's a video and there's a video and there's a video and there's a video and then a video and I am to the excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm a lot to the Me
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need almost no instructions that people need nearly need instructions of this applications.
Everything you need to say "Make words" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our young basically test, right?
And it seems that he just just seems to step the Siftable.
For him was just blocks.
Here is an interactive painting an interactive painting show.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftled by the same the Sift-cating the table.
Here he shows the sun up.
Video: The sun coming.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of David Mrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene braw.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done done Yeah!
By shake the shaking of Siftable, and the next to the characters to one anothers -- Video: Weal.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it distrike.
Video: The cattled away.
DM: The last example that I will show you that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument, where every Siftable, where every Siftable, where every Siftable, based a sound and drum.
Any has been four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftable, so you can detern themselves to pattern itself.
And you place a sound in the pattern by the atterns by a leg Sift-live controlled live controlled effects like reverble available and filter.
They're being a sound and added by side.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattacking on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a leaving a lead.
Now I place the basic.
Video: DM: Now I feed a little bit slaght work.
Video: And now I buy the filter to the filter to the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate it by the cancering of the obviously blocks.
Video: Now I buy the filter to the base for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can recognize it a pattern while it play.
I don't have to provide everything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And finally the dims of the end, by the end, by the end, by the end,
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from new people, my passion from new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and work our brain and work our brain and work and work and works.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of design with some possibilities that we develop the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just a new generation is just a new generation to a very new generation to interact with digital media, which brings the information to our world like we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to you all and talk to you all and talk to you.
I'm writing
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long time, I am not writing writing that ever will change it.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, and career, and careering my relationship to my relationship to see my work.
And it started a book that I wrote until I wrote under, a memoire, "Eten, Biddle -- Biddy, very contrained to my first work and a international existence the whole world and an international exist.
And the consequence, people all all over the whole and always it to be damned in the ways of doing it.
World that -- you know, basically what --
People come to me and ask me and asked me and asked me to say, "Don't you afraid that success is never going to be evenars?
Don't you afraid you will stay your entire life writing but never write more a book that people will be published for people to be write for warm to be write of heat?
You don't afraid to that,
And you know, the tool, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be very 20 years ago, I was when a teenager, when I was a teenager, if I said I write write to write 20 years ago.
People said, "Don't you afraid you're never succcess you're never going to be success?
Don't you afrather for wish, you won't go on through it.
Don't you afraid you will be living your life work without that there ever did something that comes out of your broken droms of your broken dreams with your broken broken broken with your bitters of fail?
And it is in that strets.
And in the short comes to the questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that are called
Always of it.
But I'm also for a lot of other things that you don't know you want to know that all of them all --
For sea for example, and other singdom.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that comes from, where that comes fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody is to be scared to be afraid for the work for the work for the work for the work for the work for the work of the work for the work for the work that they are made to their opin?
What is so particularly so exactly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of them on the spirity, something that is not happened to work in the way that is not happened to work on the mind.
Take my father. He was skull engineer, and I can't remember that there was anyone in the 40 years that he was asked to him it to him it for him or he didn't afraid it for a bang for it.
And so said, "Yohn, how do it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, so there was no talking about it.
To be fair to be fair to engineering engineers by the centuries, also not the reputation of manicalcoholists.
And so writers writers that have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have blank people, the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reput
Look at the griming doctors under the most magnificant creative spirits of the 20th century.
And many of the boys, often young, often by own own own own through own them.
And even those who don't have suicide no suicide to be able to obvious to be obvious.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of myself affect of myself."
That's a little bit of what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of spoke to the way from this kind of spoke longer out.
We've all heard it before and it was accepted to solid it all before.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity of unlose is that connected to suffering that an artist, and that an artist, eventually lead to care of the subject.
So I want to ask everybody here today: do you have that idea of living this:
You fill through that, OK?
I think I'm going to talk about it at the way I think about it doesn't have pretty pretty thought of thought of it.
I find it representation.
And also another one of this.
I wouldn't like to see that this century is going to be so much like this.
We can spirit of better to live sports.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to that dark thought of this dark thought of thought that dark in my situation.
See the phase that my career, where my career.
Go only after young, amper further age years.
I can maybe I can be four decade a four decade
Heye probably will be anything that I'm going to be published by the outside world as it work that extraordinary successful book.
We're friends up here with friends under one another, so I can do you felt my biggest success of my greatest success of behind me.
Jem, which is a little bit of an idea!
If you go think, you know, you know, you're going to know the morning to the negs hour to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me song me the work I love to the work I love it.
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after long after a conclusion that I can only go through with writing if I decided to write if I building a psychological protection.
I have to write a safe distance between myself and my overwhile, and my overwho's very understanding for the reactions for the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the responsecurrenty to write a safe distance.
I had looked at ways to ways to ways to do that.
I am in history and I did history and have distances to see if other civilizations or anothers have found a better way to help creative people to help creative to the emotional complicative process.
My search has brought me to the old Greeks and Romein.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeinen and Romeins people didn't believed that creativity was from themselves.
And I believed that creativity was a garden, who was a well-mind of a distantly place to human before and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks now called these basically circle of creativity "demonth."
Oobvious that he had a demon who had a demon who influence him to influence.
The Romeins had a kind of equalifically idea.
And in them called a little bit of a geniused to be a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius not a particularly piently pired of a genius to clear.
In their political entity was a genius, a genius, and that opened in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist of the artist was the genius of the genius was the genius of the engineer.
And he shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about the earlier -- the psychological protection of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work went in his work
The artism was so in protect to protect for example,
If you brilliant, you came to be there, you know, you know, you won't get all the ear.
Everybody knew that a unvisible, which you have holped a genius.
You know, you get a work on you, you know, it's not just you.
Everybody knew you had a rather indehange genius.
Long time is that the West, the Lang time creativity was considered to be providing
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed it.
There is a whole new idea: the individual human being is the resource of the universe and state all the godds and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, attack from the dival world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely came from the individual completely came to the individual.
And for the first time in history was about artists artists said that they were a genius and not that they didn't have a genius.
I have to say that I want to say that a big wrong time.
To one person, one person, one person, one to believe that he or she or she or she she or she saves the fattle, the source of everything good evalue, and the same familiar is to figure out of a fragingly human psyche.
And as if you ask somebody asks the sun of smits in a slight.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high experienced to expressions of prestations.
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists of artists have made a lot of artists of artists in the last 500 years of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not to be
Well light we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes.
Probably in the audience people who reference resident doubt about the idea that elphysics about the idea that elphysics of the fairly pooder the work of artists to inspiring heights to inspire artist.
It doesn't seem to be to me.
And I ask it up.
Why not?
Why would we not have to do that thought to be follow?
It's just as much as much as all of the other explanations of the total uncomputational uncomputational process.
Everybody who are trying to create something has trying to create something -- so in fact -- so in fact that the creative process here -- that the creative process is not always ration.
That sometimes almost paranormal.
I have recently recently realize the great American closer Ruth Stone meet meet meet of the wonderful American Stone of the wonderful American Stone of the wonderful of the wonderful American Stone of the wonderful American close close of the amazing American close.
She is the next design. Her whole life all writing them.
She told me about her childher right on the plattrtracted of Virginia.
Somes, if she was on the field, she felt a poems a bit about the country.
It was, so she said, she also was a big wave air.
And so a poem wave golf than the country to her
She felt that the ground under her feets started to shake her to do and knew that her on that moment but to do one thing for her life.
And she went home, back-following and she had to see so fast so quickly as possible and paper.
And when it was her poem through her her was that her only her only to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then rounds, but running and ran ran and ran ran and ran room.
And in such moments the close of her her her her -- in her words on the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And I think there were a little bit -- I think that was the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost lived the poem -- they almost light to almost mist.
And then she was in the house and paper and paper and paper, and she level through her it.
And Juist that moment she had a pot-hand-up.
And with her other hand, she plucked me she plucked out of the air.
and she picked it to his tail, and pull it back into her body, as she wrote, and she wrote it up.
In that case, the poem wonderful wonderful in a paper of paper but then in the follow.
And when I heard that I thought -- which happens to be -- which is my creative process of the creative process of my creative process of the creative process of thought period.
And so my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, who is a mice every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating through it and trans through it is a global through them.
But even in that day day I had had a experience I had such an experience.
You will also know it to yourself in your business, that feeling that there are creative ideas in your broidentify that you can can identify your impossible that you can identify your impossible that you can identify your impossible that you can identify your impossible is that they can identify include you can identify it
What is that source?
How can we use the without that we are crazy to be able to us?
At a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example, I can think I can think I can think is musician.
I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way to do it this.
And in fact, a big part of his life of his life of his life of the amazing of the amazing of the same artist that trying to get to the unforfortable creative impulse to him in him.
And the years of the years was Tom a little roostigation.
And one day he reference in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed it a process of radical.
And as he was so driving a fragment, he heard a fragment.
The decided him, like inspiration that is does it does understand,
It was a beautiful mesody and he wanted to hold it the holds.
But that wouldn't be that.
He had no paper, no paper -- no taper, no taperecore to them.
And the wonderful familiar exciting exciting the melods, "I rerecommend the meloddge, and then it turns out to follow.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't refully in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the wheel?"
"Do you really think I can be a song you now a song of the song?
And if you really want to get that this song you, you have to get later age you for you.
Not if somebody else did somebody else difficult --
Ga neighborhoods at Leonard Cohence, from that center to be a very different.
The work itself is the same thing, the dark of the familiar submarket capital underto.
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him away when he distanced the engineering of engineering the engineering of engineering in him of engineering in him to the creative process of engineering him away to him
The genion sat him on the skin and liversion and liversed only one.
And realized that there was no reason to go to understand it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the ownership between Tom and the ownership ect that was not quite as a long as a coul.
That story has changed my way of work is changed.
I had a profit from there.
I was writing process of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle.
And I am in a calling point of despair.
You know that well, you want to work and you won't do well-edge and you think it's a terrible disast. The worst book ever book it.
Not just just bad of bad bad.
I wanted to purpose.
And then I remember Tom that are who wished to be a whole wished a point to a point
I wished me from my manuscritical cript and direct me to a very corner of the room of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know everybody thing, we know everything that if this is not only coming through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the stop in me.
And I can't give it up.
And if you think it better can, you have to do you.
You don't have you? Do you don't do that, unamber thane.
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notor, and in the notor, you know, again, you know, now am a difference."
And I mean, it comes up here on the right here on the down.
Euws came up in the North African desert African desert people to dance to dance to dance in sacred music.
And then hours and hours and hours to the morning global global --
That was always great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometimes there was something something happened to be something like something extraordinary.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know, you know, what I mean with that, you know, you also have seen you also have seen something like this, you know, you know,
It was like the time standing stand the dance through a patch of step.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of them together, but now everything together.
And it seemed to seemed only a human being.
In him, under him, under him, above him.
A good fired fired him.
And if something like this, you know, people who was going to be Dan people who started to clap them and close to clap and call the time, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
And the Moren of a fun fact -- when the Moren South South Span, they broadly broading this wonderful with it.
The equired is real by the centuries, by the centuries, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, other, Allah, other."
That you hear the day of you today and flamengodancing and flamengodances.
If an artist in Spance something impossible or magically dood, "Allah, Allah, other, Allah, other, browing through this, broad."
Right? One of the God.
Precipies what we need to do need.
And last is real real that the dance the next morning to the next that he discovered on dincluding 11 hours at the morning of the morning charge is not a good charge more ladn’t more head.
At that moment he is going to be again, he never before that may never before that may never will come to such more like this.
Maybe never going to be more somebody God privated during his dance.
What to he now to the rest of his lives?
That's hard.
That's really hard to squarter for a creative spirit of a creative spirit of a creative spirit of a spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative sp
But so painful hits not need to be it being not be it.
Not if you don't get out of your person aspects of your person aspects of your person aspects of yourself.
And imagine you believe them a while she didn't have a while, basically bream of a source.
And when you're ready to them, they're given through someone else.
That's what it is to consider everything.
I handle inflying done in the moment that thought of thought of it.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside of a book that is going to appear. It was going to be a lot of reach long time.
The follower of that illuster progregater progression.
And if my mind to me the hands of the hold me on the hold before, I don't know.
And just a little bit of work.
And just just a lot of your things, which is it is.
If you get task you is to dance, you know, dance.
If the good genius that you is to decision to decision to your work at enious sources something of the wonderful sources by leage, "Ol.
And through it doesn't dance through thank you through it.
And then, "Ol.
I believe that I believe this.
"Ol, anything as ever -- because we pure human love and wisdom by human loving plooter.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that means, and the discovered.
We actually start from a new point of a new point of the biology at the digital code, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new fase in biology, with the designing and synthising synthiss;
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to understand what I think many biologists tried to understand on different levels.
We have tried different approaches to learn to minimum components.
We're now it to the digitize of digitize the digitize of the digitization.
And when we have sequenceed the human genome of the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask the question: can we create new, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory to multiply in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we have tried to look at a nonce if we can come to a non-tinue.
We can go into the order of hundred genes from the 500 or anything that are there are 500 or anything that are there are are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively is that relatively simple to the one.
Gelebrity, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can basically example, it's very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell that we could probably be a living cell close to all the genes that this is a living close a living cell close to
We decided to be the only route forward to synthetic this chromosome of the most fundamental synthetic so that we could ask a few of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as wondering, "Can we have a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic
So the chemistry to do it very large molecules that we never seen before?
An, if we do that, if we start a chromosome "?
A chromosome of chemical inert is just a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accement on exponential way.
Our power, to write the genetic code.
And our last point would place it would places on an exponential curve.
We're over 15 years ago.
There were some of corning towards, starting with a bio-ethic tool-ethic tools of course.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be hard to be very hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to be a very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be a synthesis of DNA is very hard to
There are tens of thousands of powers in the world that little pieces DNA make, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the more mistakes of the longer you make it be.
So we had to put a new method to the core of these little pieces and the corrigerating of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt of the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the wrong,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we piece of a chemical stopping chemical stopping the bacteria closer and the bacteria close, and viral particles went and viral particles went to make a chemical particles went to make chemical particles went into the bacteria of chemical particles went to do chemical par
The viral particles were cells from the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back after that, and deathed the E.
I was until I was speak with the oil industry, and I said that they were just too good snast.
They laughts over you.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software building his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial ch
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in the size of viruses, so that we could captures -- so that we could captures --
to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is crital information and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accurable.
And when we first came to the genome of the genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard per 10,000 baseparated a 10,000 baseparat.
And finally we found after resequencing 30 mistakes 30 mistakes the original sequence, it was not to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to be able to started to figure.
And designing the design is the designing of pieces that have to be five learning out of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they have to design so they can go to design so that they can go to design so that they can go to design so that they can go to design so they can design so that they can be able to go to design so that they can be able to go to de
We designing here unique unique down.
Maybe you have read to stop water that we put water in stop.
There's think, we have a source, we have a squartery genetic code: A, Gend, Gend,
Trios of those letters of letters for 20 aminoseirs -- that there is a letter of clearning for every aminozle.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentence, thoughts.
And then we only called a bit only one.
Some of them were television there were no close.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repay and they put them in each other.
And we started pieces of them to piece, start pieces that five to 7,000 letters long time, and you have pieces that were pieces of 24,000 letters, to 72,000.
In every stadium we came to a fluence of these pieces so that we could sequence, because we want to create a process that is very robuust -- that will be very robuust -- that will be very robuddge.
We're trying to achieve the point of automatic.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as soon as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate basepars -- they don't grow easy more in E.
And that is the extincluding of the modern tools of the modern of the molecular biology.
That's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombination.
Here is an example.
There's an organism called Deinococococococococococcus that three million rad rad to can.
And you see that in the bottom panel, she just looks like this.
12 hours later 24 hours later it was in each other, like it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely opened being completely dried
They can life in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure there can life in space that can be moving in space, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shows shows that there is a lot of this, there.
Here's a failecule microphone of the molecule that we've made these processes -- actually usually only with these processes -- actually only yesterday mechanisms with the right designs that we did in it.
Gist makes it automatically continue to the automatically
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a non-photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we have include.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecuulght is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there's 142 pages only to drugs to drugs only to drugs to drugs.
Well, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the activator?
And with a virus is clearly easy.
And with a bacteria is the much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you take your eukaryots, like we just wheel, you just wheel, you just wheel, and that's what you know if you clloud to cloud as it class.
And in the bacteria of chromosome of the chromosome of the cell in the cell, but we have showed that we have a complete transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of the cell to another and activate.
We have a chromosome of a microbbing of a microb-species.
These are about so far as far as people and micked mess.
We add some extra little bit of extra genes that we could select select to be selecting a chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the extra chromosome extra general extra chromosome extra chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome extra chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the extra gen
We have been transed with enzymes to make all the egs to make all the egs of the egs.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced graphical images -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of chromosome in the cell.
We even thought he would come to sover and shape the process of a process of developing a process of developing a process of develop.
This is an essential evolutional evolution.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the third them or a third somewhere they add thousands of properties in one times to the species.
People who are evolution to evolution evolution to the same time, not change a lot of biology that are not a lot of biology.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that are actually failed DNA
The chromosome that was not ever ever ever ever eating.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- well,
It was expressed, and the recognized the other chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cell of the cell of chromosome of the celement, and it was a little bit was a little chrow
He was blue because he was stopped in them.
And in very short time away, all the characteristics of the one species, and changed the one of the new species, and he changed completely in the new software that we stop.
All the same times changed the membrans -- when we set the genetic code.
This is a made clines like genomic, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Now, I've been paying before that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a billion years evolution, and I have pathree of the Camblic explosion of the Cambig, and I have pathree of the Camblic explosion of the Camble new species that make big scaling in this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it needs to look at what it needs.
We're going to take a six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context placement -- I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for each of us that in 1946; within 46; within 40 years that are going to be four there.
We have a lot of food, with food, with clean water, global water, goods, fuel for the six-and-half billion.
That's hard to do that.
We use five billion tons of colles, over 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
And when we take biological processes in the momenic process than any process to replace that is to replace.
Then there is a natural dioxide of the core of the cities that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming up in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is a cool in the atmosphere is coming the carbon dioxide of the cool dioxide of the cool dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmoal.
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had been a doing a dozens of components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming.
We're mainly limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now now that we have this faster synthesize synthesize that called combination to do called combination --
We now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the course of 20 million different genes or thinking, or trying to optimize octan, or drugs to produce octan, we can produce a little team or a small team biology to change in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular biology than science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select to life for life fatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design design designs that we work on the global that we can actually go to the global kind of like computer.
We don't know what it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We now focus on fourth generation fourth generation fuel of fuel of fourth generations.
And so you have seen your flour, you know, just a bad experiment.
We have two-third generation and third generation fuel that will come from sugar, like sugar, as more higher fuel like octans or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think biology can have biology without the food price of food price and make the available price and the available of available and the available of the food subject that we have the first shift in that way, and we think that we are the first showed the first square fun generation fuces in about 18 months about 18 months of fires in about 18 months.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered the global discovered all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea -- about 2.5 kilometers dep, with calculating him temperature of them.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the course, CO2 we can be able to be able to figured through a pipe of failed to fability to furely this process.
So in a short time spend of a spend of expanding that we are able to basal question the basal question is: "What's living life?"
We have really, you know, -- you know, you have the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can do this?
A major energy source.
But we're working now now to use these tools to think of these tools to think of fast.
And this year was the flu -- we walked always behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the age of aged vaccine.
And here you see how the future can see the future that the evolution tree is going to change the evolution tree is going to change with synthetic bacteria, and eventually bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still away from the improve people.
Our goal is sure that we make a chance to survive a chance to survive long enough to do. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to be a new technology that we based to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can figure out on the immense amounts of visual data can work on the fish.
We look at this hands here many gigabyts, and can be able to stay in the case and can be nedless and out, and extincluding the currens.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at these collections or images are images.
Most of this, most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and sit in the 300 megapixally reach.
It doesn't all of it because the only thing that would be the only would influence, on a subject system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image picture.
This is by Dickens. Every colle. Every collect is a chapter.
To evidence that it's really too, and no imagine, and not a imagine, to show that this really text is; this is not imagination.
And maybe this is a little strange way to read a book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistically example. This is an example.
Every large picture is the beginning of a part of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or caps or capital or capital is a scale medium.
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a bunch of advertising a lot of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertised.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of accortions of accorporate through the screen of accorrect through the limitations.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other other thing, and other other thought flaure.
Of course, landmaps for a hand longics for a technology like this, I will not spending to a technology like this, I will not spending this field-basically be contributed to this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And on the top of the NASA --
Now let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two technologies with each other.
One is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snah, promoved, so by Seitz Steve Seitz U.W.
and Rick Smare with Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
And when we do this, you see this, we see through the images and the multi-solution.
The space of the images of the images of the images here.
The computer vision algorithms have been pictures have been broken up with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome -- where they are genome egy -- where they are genome elements of stabilized diashws or pancy images of these things are space.
I don't know sure or there's time time there, other environments.
There are much more space there are mucher.
I like to like Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a setons -- and this is a seeal prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summer -- to the communicate the communicate of the environments on our website.
We had to do with the advocature and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames with imaginarian of Flickr. You search Dame on Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus
And every single of these orange gets a imagination that part of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model in the bull thing again.
And so these are all Flickr imaginations, who are all in this way space way space in this way space of space
And we can care about simple way,
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would work to Microsoft of Microsoft --
It's overwhelming here is so designed to be so much of this.
I believe you can see that these many types are cameras are cameras are good to mirroflexcameras, a big number of them, and feed in this environment.
I'm going to try to find some weird images.
There are so many covered by faces and the same through this.
And between this, even though a series of pictures -- here's them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is goodged by the program.
If we came through the poster in a physically image of this environment.
What we really want to say is that we really can do things with the social environment. This uses now the data -- of the whole collective memory of the collective memory of how you can see -- and buy that everything to do about one anything to each other.
And all these pictures are being a very larger than the shapes a little bit larger than the subject of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is from whole Earth is --
And so, this as a squarter, on Stephen Lawler's work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use, and also the view growing for the people who used it.
Their own photographs are being a metaphor.
If someone would like someone would like to attrack and their names and their names invotes and their names of the Notre Dame alone, and I can use that data, and I can use it as a metaph, which is a metaph, which is used to be a metapholent of anybody photographs, and create a kind of a kind of a cruise modal, and create social social social social social social social social social social so.
And of course, the bety-product pictual model of this immense rich fashion Earth, who only only from airl, who only only from airl, who only only from the airstance, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I started to do that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are departed by everybody on the world can buy on the world together to the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this really doing is discovered.
And the creating of your wish, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that is that exciting when you think about the riches of semantic information that you think about the riches of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
And when you look for the web to the pictures, you see a search of a searching in the web, and the text on the webpage of what the imagina lot of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagina sweb page of a pictures, you see a pictures, you see a little bit of the images, you know, when you get a pictures, you see the text-eype of the imagina is a lobal information about what the imagina lot of information about what the pictures, you search of information about what the penvagets.
What if now that is the imagination is all your imagination?
Then the number of the underived and the amount of the amount of wealth that comes out of that, it's a classic. It's a classic. It's a classically networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible.
One of the intense pleasure and of eating eating and of eating the ability to live between them, between them, who are not forget to forget, who are not forget to the wind, who are still feeling their past, the profitters in blow-police plants, the probability to the profession in bloaders.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky Way galaxy, or that the myths of Inven-parently parently with meaning the Himalaya boodhist boodhist on the boodhist of Dharma, you remember to remember the world in the breathropology in a breathropology in a bsolute sense, but is not a single model of the world in a model of the work of the world in the basic.
the consequences of a light set of a choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all shared the same tape every edge: World born. Brength.
We all thrite of independed up thrites.
And because of the individed diastinctive diase.
So it can't be surprising that we sing; dance and art.
But the unique is the unique cadance of the dance and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is to the Penan in the wire Borneo, or the Vood-acolliers in Haiti, or the freedoma's fighting in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-based or the Caravantage of the Carai in the Sahara. -- this is the guy of Sahara. -- this is the guy with the deathrough the deathrough Qoma's word-based in the Anya-based Qomolangma,
Everest, the godin-mother mother of the world.
They're learning us to be different, otherwise can think of the Earth, differently.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of this.
Shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her and cultural life is as biological web: the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine your same as a ebat.
And the nosphere you can defines you defines the totally of all the thoughts, dreams, mythes, mythes, and intuitions that are constantly by human imagination that are constituted by human imagination that are consciousness.
The eater is the great nalatency of humanity.
She is the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be amazing and all that we can be amazing curious species.
Not like the biosphere is heavy is the eater that is -- and in many larger that eyellow is in many larger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist that least half of all the species of all species on the point of extinction, because that's not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this, it's loss of this.
And then everybody here was born born of them were spots, and they were trying to talk on Earth.
A language is over her than her grammary or her grammatic rules.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the ference of the sicle of every unique culture the material world reach.
Every language is a centuried spiritual mind, a disingd; a thought, a discontinue possibilitual opportunities.
And from that sixth thousand languages today the day is not fluence.
They're not learned babies no longer
Effectively means that, unless a change that they are dead.
Is there something that is to be a little bit of silence, the last of your people, the last of your people, speaking the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children have to see
Pifice that is somebody's benefits every two weeks on the Earth, because every two weeks of the last letter-a-fairly and with him the last letter.
Some of you say, "Well, you know, don't have better place if we all all the the same language of the same language of the same language of them. Or Kantone. Or Kantone.
Or Kogi.' you'll realize you realize how it would not be your own language to speak you.
So what I really want to do is take you today is taking you on a short journey by the eating noshed a picture that has lost a picture of what is lost in fact,
And many of us to forget that when I'm talking about another way of being a different way of being a different ways of being a different ways.
Let for example, this Barasana child in the North West Amazon, the people, the people, that believes that believes that the close of she was flowing out of the and, in the buy cleans, from the east.
This is a whole cognitive the colors blue and not substance, because it wonderfully from the skulling of the equivalence, where the following is depending on the dependence.

And one of the fascinated tribes that I had read lived the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuadorani in 1958 performance contact was contact in 1958 perced.
In 1957 tried to five missionarisss, but they made a critical phyage.
And the air, they were pictures of themselves from themselves to our idea of themselves that this completely never seen a two-dimensional image image be.

It's a picture I jump a bit of the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive mountains of the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.

And that pooder your nose is in blower of a being a shot of a being shot of a sea baroker images, to country to a country to a distribution of the reality; the shipe of reality.
I was trying to figure my professor, Richard Evan Shtes, to convince a man who discovered the psychedge in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean that these tryptamines were not to identificate as hallucinated as hallucinated to be intrying to experience, there is no one more home to experience. Tryptributed to experience. Tryptamines are not order to be a smelling enzym by a single simal: mmonoamine oxi.
They can only be oral organizing something that the monoamine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the sample of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the samine of the samine of the monoamine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the being onenomist.
The fascinating is that the basically carbolines in the limited monoamine-supports subjects are to activators to activate the tryptamine of the trype of the trype of two morphological planties two morphological planet, two morphological variety of the combined species that are bigger than the shapes that is bigger than the shapes that is bigger than the ship.

Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even those sympathic folks that sympathy seeing in the history, as course, and colorable and colorable and colorable and colorable to see a foot-need world in history as the real world, meaning our world, meanings our world, through the world, through our world, meaning our world, through the problem.
The truth is that 20th century about 300 years to be not remember to be his war or technological innovations, but before as the age that we were stood and active particips or passive participated to the mass destruction of biological and cultural diversity and cultural diversity on planet.
All the cultures have always part of a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Siously, when they gavate their pile, and they gavate their pile, just as the Americans are stops Americans say, when they gave.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the ethreatened the integrity of threat. It's powere.
The crude of the government of the government.

And one day they put per unhappiness on a poorer on a Mao. For this continued for this controlling earlier.
The pain of Tibet can be unwonderful but the free of the people, but the free is something to correct you to core your fast.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Do we have a fline world of simply or want to live a color-world of diversity or want to be a color?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead said she was peaced, that she directioned that she direction.
We would not only see the human imagination are being a smal, modited a smal, but also we would have to be able to wake and forget to exist.
We can feel nederived us to feel that our species is about 150,000000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave us agriculture gave us the cular of the seed, when the point of the shaman became replaced by the prozors and we had a shocked by specialization and we had a showed thousand we put a specialization of the bad 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
And these surface history gives me not the idea that we will not get all the answers to all the answers to all the question of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to people, responses are asked 10,000 different voted voices.
And it's that song, that we will discover the capability to be what we are, a full species, that is a full species, that everything in the work and all of the gardens and all the garborners. There are great moments of optimism.
And this picture I was on the north of Baffin Island genomen, when I went to Inventually sheed.
This man, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Iner. In the 1950s became in. In the 1950s, in closes of course, in closes of currents.
The opa of Olayuk.
The family peace for his life, and afterter, all his tools and receipens, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Insian, they used to us.
The gline of their key became made of their key became made of fish in charibooks.
Olayuks opa was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that was windown.
He went out, like, like, he went to free-hits and put put his hands. And then he went the poop started freezing, shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a low speak to the side of the side of the mess.
And when it was solid solid a dog measure.
He did the dog and improvised a hearnas.
And from the ribbankly came to a bag.
He was looking at a neighborhood and disappeared about the ice flate, including pool poops.
Over with nothing comes to be around anything about this, in many way, many symbol for the weather and all the indicularly people.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Infrom the entire being a piece of country and Texas a bigger than California and Texas sample of the called Nunavut.
It's independent area. They retails all the groundary of the grounds.
It's a amazing example of how a national example of how a national example.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly clearly at this hits of the world is required that they actually didn't get away away away away away to far all.
They're manding myself home country.
They're going to be the same thing of human imagination, that go back to the beginning of the time. And for us, the dreams of these children, just as that are part of the unclean, part of an universal of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is going to be extensive from the idea that politicians never achieve to something like this.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemic -- we think a polemic -- but we believe that stories can change the world, which is that stories we probably think the best tellers in the world, we are 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries a month, we are in 156 countries on TV and our magazine public public.
We make a lot of traveling to travel a lot of travel, with our audience, to our audience, to the same particultural cultural places, where it sees he seeing what he sees hopefully anything he seeing in the antropology will be to existencouple of the antropology that will be in different in different in a way that we can find a way to life and life in a multure.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some ask that I have dedecided to you a book a book of a book of thing.
Maybe you see parallel parallel with information of other sources.
I try to explain a little bit of surprising you may be mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly being exactly -- the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma of skifically as follows on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good is a great dealing part of the human being part of the human being.
And then, by access to access to access to access to account a higher providing to reach a higher providing without of this.
And the ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically more wonderful wonderful wonder.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would take to evolve ever doubt of doubt that nobody would take a society.
And in our life is this dogma corn.
I'll give you some examples, I'll give you some example.
This is my supermart. A big.
And, about dressing.
Now, that 175 can-hand-hydressems of three of them are extra-virgin my supermarket viral and different balsamics and a different balsamics and a different balso.
And that can make you couldressources of the dresses between that 175 species for you.
So that's the path of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can imagins. You can imaginate your stereoset of the game -- airler, cd-player, cassettal power.
And in that one electronics you can choose you can choose out of this attack.
You can say you can say and a half million systems with parts of systems with parts from that store.
Give too -- you've got a lot of time.
And again, again, again,
And when I was young time you could take all kinds of phone services are all the phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You're not going to be your bought it. You don't bought it.
That was the front of the advantage that it never ever went to be piece of the benefity.
That time is the age of time.
Now, there are a lot of different stated.
And before to cell phones is the diversity is the diversity
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the average -- that with musher and crusers pired and critership breakdown.
Wellight you have not seen this model in the store, but you can see there are certainly short that happened.
And the follow: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attack of stuff is this explosive increased of choices of choices of choices of choices are a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States that you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do that, we can do that.
A has this force, and navor and navor and navor this formal and after.
And I mean, this is a picture and navade?"
And you say, "Doctor, what does you?"
And the doctor, says, "A has this form, and the doctor and the doctor.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Docter, if you was, you know, if you was, what do you do?"
And the doctor, says, "But I'm not you."
And that called "own inbring inker of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means that the heavy task of decision of someone of the decision of things -- the doctors -- the doctor -- to a seemed -- to a person who certainly sick and not the best condition to recept decisions -- the patient. For on recept -- the patient.
Good consider consider that ners up, because the goal, you can't buy it. You can't buy it.
Why do they make it affectly, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctor to ask our doctor to ask that other mark to other market that other marks.
And our identity, yet a singroom of us existing on the existence, now in this slide.
Our identity state in our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to just want.
Every morning to the open to the open you need to think of what you want to be you.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that free everybody else that you were going to be so quickly from that you can imagine, and then by the way, and then then started to kids and started to kids start.
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did did you did doesn't do this.
Now lies now is free everything for the opening.
I give lesson for particularly intelligent students, I give 20 percent less homework less than the early.
They're not dom, if you were early in the way,
No, they have drugs choices.
"Well, I say, whether not? Well, I now?
Or I'll wait? Now, I will wait? Now, I will shether a career?"
These are all the way questions.
They go through to them, also they are not going to get a little bit of their homework and therefore and therefore no good number of triends.
And they have right. They're important life questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just gave that technology us to work. Carl us, every minute of every minute work -- capable than in the Randolph of the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place place, which I love secret, where WiFi the does.
I won't true, because I want to keep that place for myself for myself for myself for myself to me.
But anyway, who are huge choice of work holding that we are going to work on the right or whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a football widdle of our son the one hand, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all stand all of them, are we all get every minute of that continue of that continue to all kinds of questions?
And I think about this emailt respond? And already writing this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne," we experience, we experience.
What we also look at the small, the small, materialistic bags, lifestyle, lifestyle.
And so the world asked on the world looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a issue of choose.
And so the world now looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of course?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we're good is good about it, I'm going to talk about what's bad about what's bad about what's bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects on human being.
A very contraining effect is that it is paralyzed than basically basically basically than basically basically basically basically than basically basically basically it's better.
And with so many choice possibilities people to make it a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research of investments in freedoms in volunteers.
A colleaguard of me to investment data from Vanguard, a big polded a big polity, a big policy society of spread of 2,000 vestigations.
She discovered that for every single designed the worker that are the working fundred the work of two percent desire.
In fifty fundred 10 percent less percent less than five founds. Why?
Because it's fifty founds, so hard to choose people are just existing the choice to the next day, and that was though, and that opened this, and so on.
And of existence comes from outside.
That is not only that people after their pensioned after their pensioner because they don't have a dread, because they didn't have any money because they didn't have any familiar the choice that she was working on the work of the pensionate of them shoot share.
And that led them to a 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worked was capable of the work was pretty to double.
So the thing that is a lot of choice can work on the freedom.
And I think the world out of that, there's so looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make a very low to make the right choice choices, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundressembing founds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we have the lower of us shape and choose eventually less teeth, eventually less tevace than the case would be if we had less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had led as the case of us as the less of the case of us as we had left lea
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, behind the choice can stay that the choice didn't perfect perfectly was not perfectly not perfectly on the choice,
You ask you in such case that would have been better better would be better better.
And this is dream alternative alternative to your choice.
And speakes break on the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you had a good choice.
And the more option, the more option. And it's easier to have a spired to have been able to have a speak of the geckod option.
A second reason of substitutions cost of doing substitutions --
Dan Gilbert from morning to how often we have the value of things that we are depending the value of the things that we equivalue.
If you can think of many alternatives you can think of the attractive opportunities of all the alternatives that you did.
That makes you have less text less text that you have chose to you have chose to the alternative that you have chose
A example. For non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example.
This is a slight on the Hamptons.
They have a fairly second wound.
They are a beautiful beach. Straling again. No human beautiful.
Don't be won't do it? "For, it's augenty," thinks that man, "It's augendor.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of it.
I could flat my car, I could park my car."
And he is too simply simmply there with the idea that he is a great parking again,
Substitutic cost of the entire cost of the environment, even if we make a great choice choice.
And the more opportunity of the more opportunity alternatives are there.
And those presentation cost of us as substitutions as we should be substitutions as we have presentation.
Another example.
This pictured a few of the points.
Life in the here and now for example, and that you don't have to continued it.
And one thing is that you have to do is that you have every choices of choices.
And all that other has been so many similarities that the geckoses are less attractive less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this through my search for a new bask.
I almost always spired to spired to broad.
Well, if you were only one kind of played broek, and that bought your dan. It was not a lot of incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the broek and often the broek of the broek and often enough and often enough the right OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new new one.
I said, "There's my make, I want to do a spired a good break of a global break."
And the store said, "Will you fit fit, easy fit or relaxy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know or a rits? Will you know a stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you know a break with a bit of submity?
You know, walking something extinctive pipe, or flash walk." And so he went down." And so he went to through this.
I was spoke to a spoke a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say the only break that was."
He had no idea which was a broek, and so I have a long time long all the possible broeks of the possible broed.
And I mean, I left the store eventually eventually extensive a bit of a bit of broed.
I had better done it better of those possibilities.
But I didn't better it.
Why? To explaining myself out, I wrote a book of them.
And the reason I didn't feel better with all this choice, was that I started to expect more expected from a good speedition of a good speek.
I started without no only expectation, because I just just one kind of spired to know.
And then turned out there were different and one of them would be a single of that,
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my break with my break with my expectations, and that asked me to me.
And the more opportunities people have did to expectations of those earning about the earning of those opportunities.
And that means people are less texts, people are less texts, even if it's good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In really the way it is about it.
And everything was better when everything was better when everything was better
Because when everything was bad and people could have pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society of society as well-citizens perfection, but the best thing that is so good as we can achieve ever expected as we could do it is so good as we had to do it.
Never before we are surprised because our expectations, my expectations, torently being tol.
The secret of happiness -- you know, the secret -- the secret -- the secret of happiness.
I want to stand -- I want to get a car biographically elemental -- that I am with a woman who really faile.
I didn't have me to her less text with less text less teeth.
But less enough take less enough his good side.
And finally, you to find a bad spired a bad spired to buy a bad way if there is only one kind of a piece of being why you are unteving.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bits of salize and you buy a lot of them to fall the time, who is the responsible of themselves?
The answer is just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decisions, even if people decisions of those decisions of those decisions, they television their choice.
And they take themselves themselves themselves --
In the Western society square clinical depression under the young generations.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive total of depression and suicide is that people often often very often television and suicious experience.
And if they try to explain the country to explain, they give themselves themselves the device.
So the netoresulate is that we have objective spoken on forward to go on forward but our bad of this.
And even a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody for where you are taken to be true.
But that's not the same thing.
It doesn't have a bunch of that can choose better than not automatically automatically that is better.
There's a magical boundary of choice possibilities.
But I know that we have been for for a long time, that choice is that choice us are well.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing that can keep us the best of the best thing that can keep us the best of the best of the best thing to do to be the best of the best thing that is the best thing to do to be the best of the best thing to be the best of the best thing to be the best of the
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, there's a lot of places that the problem isn't that much choice is not so much choice is to be there.
So the paradox I talked to the paradox I talked to the modern West.
That's frustrating, and that's frustrating. Steve Levitt you yesterday and told to installing to children's children's boating kids not help kids doesn't help your money.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help it. Erger not; they didn't help it out.
They make us live less worth.
If a part of what people in our society of those choices to make all these choices were behaving to be able to countries to where people have to have been to go to forward the life of those people who went to it.
And our life would be going to go on on on forward.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improve improve it.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have been doing with our freedom.
And finally, if you take this picture, you know, if you read this picture, human saying, "Ach, what do you know about that?
Nothing is possible in a fis."
A corrector, a short-mind global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the time I was better understood that this fish is deeply smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you fish, you have the fish, you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom, but lowing paralyzing.
If you get the fish to create possibilities, you get less text less text your less textless text of the business.
It leads to more lost and less text less text and less text less text.
Everybody has a fish.
This is a single to limits -- it's sure for us.
But the age of a figured to figured to ask is to ask call of the same thing, unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
