And I show these two slips I show these two slide of the polar cap, which is the last three million years of the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is the reason of this particular problem because it doesn't the disease, because it shows not the dised.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense of the clopping heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crack in the summer.
The next slide I show is a did version of what happens in the last 25 years happened 25 years happened.
The permanent ice is clear in red.
As you can see, it looks at dark from blue.
That's the year, that's the year,
And the summs in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years or age, is almost like blood, which is almost like blood, which is almost like flower,
In 25 years is the from this to this is going to this this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icel, and there is a very big amount of frozen carbon anger freors carbon methis. And when it is the designed by microbes in methan.
Something to the total high-regular remosponing in the atmosphere, that could double the amount of the corner as we write the crite of the course of the course of the course of the course of the atmosphere.

Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with Alaska with another team to another team down to another unear.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real real or we will be able to be that.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warm-break Greenland from the north.
This is a smell of this is a smell of this.
The water volume is bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea left of sea because it's the landics of the sea of the sea is coming in the sea lot of the sea of the sea of where it comes in the sea of the sea legacy that is the place where it comes in the sea leglass of sea full that is the place where it is the sea legist of sea leglass that if you want to know how the sea leger to know how
These streams are taking away again.
On the other side of the planet, on the South pool, on the south policy mass on Earth.
And last months scientists that the entire continent now is a negative imaginent now is a negative imagine.
More specific is the ice of the ice of the South pole of the South pole very quickly underwater islands.
The whole continent is for six meters are sea legacy six meter, just as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the size of the ice-mass, there are new now, that are new now, that are a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drops of that smel.
In the Andes, this glass this glass of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared the drinkwater.
In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It's really coming in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dreamed dreamatic sty-dramatical sty-burn.
And the number of nature, of course are cities, incredible and never seems to never see.
For the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the corner from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 24 hours.
Twenton every day in our oceans, which is good to our oceans, and look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, from America, and every side of the India subcontinent, there's a drawise of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is designed to design in 20 percent of the Earth, is the burning of fossils.
Oil is a problem, and stone carbon is the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest instoters, so, with China.
And there was a pretty to build a lot more more urban individual.
But we see a course a mean.
These are the voice carbon cool that the building was annule, in the last years, and where green alternatives were alternatives of the last years.
There is a political battle stick on the gang in our country.
The steone carbon and oil-induire gave induire to promot the cool of the cool of cool to promot cool and promotting carbon cool and promotle, which is a contesting customy.
And that image to me about something like this.

And I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come up with an update about how that works.
So here I am here. For those who didn't have anything that the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever experiment in the case of the labor.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion a billion this, after the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious ambiti!
This is the machine Gengine.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of the ATLATLATLAS detector -- 44 meters the ATLAS.
Spectacular photography of ATLAS, in connect so you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photography was taken by ATLAS.
And that was a party for a party of the party of the control.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the way around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and in the detector of the LHC, and the detector of the LHC went down in the detector of the LHC went in the detect of the first photograph.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we did that the machine working, which is a huge overwhatever we have a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of this, or then, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internetpage.
That means we have a both of a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold.
And they were taking 13 thousand thousand thousand thousand power to the engine on the full power on the full resears of the engine on the full regars that the machine on the full reduce of the machine.
The engineers are going to say, "No true. They are too small rows too small the thing."
They can do that because they are supercept because they are super-entire temperaturs.
So at the min, 271 degrees of space between the stars, who can read the stream that are dream ago.
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wire of the wirmer, and there was an electric weather of the 13 thousand ample that reason.
This was the result.
This is another impression of the way if you realize that those magnets more than 20 tons of the 20 tons of the inches of the way and they were in.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did do.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We'll be able to put it again, and we expect measurements in June or right now with the further of the universe.
Now, of course, that have that unhappiness that resears the debate of science started to research. It's easy to research. It's easy to research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to go further than ever beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the definite of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangergerous progress than represented the progress than represented of the human beings are not mysteries in the natures that there are no remain the result of the definitive of the red of the definitive world that we dicular of the definitive cond once of the definitive of the definitive of the red of the red thing that we are of the ded thing that we are of the res of the res of the res of the re, and re, and dicure of the res of the res of the red work of the ath, and the re
Thank you very much!
I would like to start to ask you to ask back to your childhood and and and drops with blocks played with blocks of it.
When you discovered how to figure out how to figure out and consciously problems to learn with and depended by the resolve relationship.
Ruimtely insight is a strong because with the world to understand the world to it.
If an information of information with the nut of the nature of physical interaction with objects -- show with my advising advising objects and my feleer Jeee of Kalanithi -- what if we were used to ask -- what if we were used to use a computer information of that only information as a kind of digital fingeren-fingerreauthoration that indict with a platattace of information that information fulation fry information of information in the figure out of information that we can information that information with themselves in the shificity information with ber fulation of information of the sing ficity information of the fication of the fication of the ficity information of the shipief of the interact in
and can orders orders like we want to lea?
This question of this question of us that we decided to look for a answer by the building of Siftables.
States is a Sift of a Sift a interactive computer size of a cookie.
They can be able to the hand become field with the hand they can detect each other, and they detect a screen and wirely contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical accustomized by the way, they can be move by fixed to understand the figure of the cutting of blocks of the cure.
And the top of Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulate of digital information.
And before these resources are a more physical differences of their movement and of the way we have to movement and even of the way we move them and we have a movement, are different new and we like, there are different new and leactions of the new and leactions of the new and so,
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is Sift is institute to try to do a video that played by can't play another than the others and otherwise canopy and others played the back of the other.
These interactive portraits are awareness of each other.
And indicately next to each other, they will be interesting.
If they are remarkable to do this and they can do this and can be some sense of the wonderful.
And they feel, they feel, and helling.
We realized algave that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the stuff is like a color a fluid as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluence of the interaction of a color a fluid of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of a color of the interaction of interaction
In this example three Siftables for three Siftable, and I can use them to go to to argue color in a leg to go and I can use them to be collect to to argue where they are becoming me.
If we have dress to do what we did is a little bit back.
There are some of the cape of the capable of education, maybe game with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things fast, and the result of the capable to try to see things fast.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci result of a simple calculator.
Here we can show a game that a cross-of-Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every single around a lightly letter on every Siftable, and send dictionary dictionary in a dictional dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is that rescued to be a new series of letters with a new series of letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am it to make it and I have a video of the character.
They were really away from the way from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to almost of this application is that people need to have instruction.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the test of the other people trial.
That's our youngst basically trip.
Because he seems just the Siftable.
For him was only blocks.
Here is an interactive painting shown the interactive paint.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can new characters in the scene of the scene, by just the Sift with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done an! Yeah! Yeah!
By the shake of Siftables and the next to each other, he can respond to each other -- Video: Wealet -- Dide!
DM: and so his own story of the story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it decided to the distrike.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: the last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed to developed a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
Eengineering has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
And these sounds can be injected in Siftables are being injected so you can depick the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leg Sift that are live controllling effects as reverble age and filter.
They are being a sound advanced and advantaged by canopy.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are put on the whole pattern.
Let's look at a look at that.
Video: We're starting with a lead. We start a lead.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: I don't feed a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of work.
Video: That I couple the filter of the drums, so I can influence the effect live influence live influence of the effect of the drums,
Video: I can do it by the way, I can accelerate the off.
Video: Well, I couple the filter of the baas for what more expression.
Video: I can re-hit the pattern of the playing.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvise improvise and make it very longer and short, as I want.
With the dims of the whole of the whole Siftle.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from the creating new mental computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and lights.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with a new element of element that we developing to the developing of the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the case of the attack is a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it with you all to talk to you all with you here.
I'm writing writing
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am not writing for a long time.
And yet there is something actually happened in my life and careers in my life, and career, which I think my relationship with my work.
It started with a book that I did wrote that I was written a memoire, "Eten, Bible -- Bible in the way that was really the world and a international world and a international existence the whole world and a international existence.
The result is that people now and always have to always down to always do.
And in the way, called --
People come to me and ask me and ask me to ask me and ask you very succcess that you can never ever equival?
Do you don't want you to remain your life will be write but never remains a book publish that people will have heart to be hearing to the people for warm to go to where people will be heard to be hear?
Do you don't have any prett?"
And you know, the directly, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be a remember 20 years ago -- I was when I told a teenage -- I was write a teenage -- I was write I wanted to be a teenage of course.
People said, "Don't you get to succcess is never going to get succcess of succcess of you?
Don't you know, if you don't go on through to the subject by the way?
Don't you afraised that you can deal with this work without of this is that it comes from the public and you will dead on the public of broken with your broken bitters of fail?"
Something in that stread.
And in the short, my answer is to the questions of this questions, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called the things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called the things that are called the things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called counts.
Always the again.
But I'm also many other things that you don't want to know that all of the other things that all of the way for all of the things that all of the other things that all of the things that all of the way you don't know for which all of the other things that all of the other things that all of the other things that all of the other things that are all of the other things that all the other things --
For sea whose for example, and other ends.
But what is writing writing the last time that comes from, which comes fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be work for work for the work for the work for the work of the earth?
What is so particularly the creative processes that we make us to make the effects of it on the effects of the mind of the mindnesses.
Take my father. He was a skull engineer, and I can't remember that there was a little 40 years that he worked in the 40 years that he didn't have a bang for it.
And so said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, not became not talked about it.
To be fair fair fair fair by the centuries have not the reputation of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
And then writers writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental human beingty instability.
Look at the grimble death, the most death of the most magnificc creative minds of the 20th century.
And many of the stipate justice.
And even those who don't even have suicide that don't seem to be able to be fix under their gave gone to be concerned to be concerned to be able to be concerned to be able to be suicide of suiciic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey every of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty about your life work.
But of these kind of spoke we don't see anymore.
We all have the before and we have heard and have it with subject.
The critical thought is that creativity is that creativity is involved with suffering and that an artist-destributed to a very eventually include.
And so I want everyone here today ask everybody here today: do you have that life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about a good about that, I think the whole thought I don't think about the prettic thought.
I think it reference is failed.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this is this this this century.
We can creative spirit to add creative sports.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be dangerous to that dark though.
Sup, the fase where my careers are now inside my career.
OK, I'm young, I'm young, amper say, amper say, "OK.
I can maybe I can work four decades work through decades.
Hoogstlikely everything I'll see anything that I'll see now is that the outside world as it work on that extraordinary succccessful book.
We're with with friends, so I can lap you know, so I can lap you s: high-probably likely to be my biggest succcess for behind me.
Jem, which a little idea!
If you go think, if you think of the character, you know, for the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work of where I love with the work that I love with the work
The question is, "Do "Hoo?"
After long after a long time I can only go to the conclusion as I can only go by writing a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in.
I have to create a safe distance a safe distance between me, and my overwherever I think of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of my future publications.
I have this last year in ways to do that.
I have down in the history and I did me depends in other civilizations to see whether maybe a better way to get creative people to help creative with the emotional complicative process.
My search, my question has been in the old Grees.
Let's say, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romein's believed of people didn't believe that creativity was not the creativity of itself.
And they believe that creativity was a good mind, which was a good mind, which was a requence, incular place and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks now the Greeks of these basically creativity of creativity "demonstren."
Or, Socrates believed that he had a demon who influence the demand influence of the demand
The Romeins had a kind of a kind of a similar idea.
And in the called them was called a genius, a genius,
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, is not a particularly pended of a bit of person clear.
In their policy was a genius, a kind of magined entities that are redddenly in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the artist, the artist,
And he gave shape he gave form to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier to the result of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artists was so in the artist, for example, for example, so much narcism.
If you were working bread, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the early one.
Everybody knew that a knew that a unvisible genius,
Well, you know, you know, you know, the work of the way, well, not only have to you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time is that the West of the Wests creativity was considered to the West of the creativity of the West.
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed the Renaissance.
There was a very new ideas a very new idea: the individual human point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attackaystical world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual.
And for the first time in history was said about artists of artists that they were said that they were not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big wrong thing.
And in a person, one person, one person, one individual individual human beings or she said, the essenti, the source of the century, of everything that is good responsible of the familiar is to responsible for a fragifragic human psyche.
Anybody asks you the sun.
Egos are remained to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high-expectations of exprestations to exprestations to express experience.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back understand back understand the creative of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the air.
Maybe not a disn't
And we can do 500 years rational humanism curren't unctioned in a 18 minutes,
Probably are in the audience of people who have read scientific doubt of doubt doubt of double creatures with some feet, the work of artist to inspiring heights to inspiring heights to inspiration
It just like I don't seem to get you all that I will get you to get you to get you to me.
And I think it way.
Why not?
Why would we do that thought that thought that would we have thought that are the thought that would we have thought that thought that thought that would we have thought that thought that would we have thought that thought that would we have that thought that would we have thought that would we do that thought that would we do not have thought that thought that would we thought that would we have thought that would not have though
It was just as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally incomputability that decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something has to do something that has to be able to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so that the creative process here, is that the creative process of the entire contributts.
That sometimes it has almost paranormally includes that almost paranor.
I have recently recently the amazing American close Ruth Stone meet.
She is close in the nine. Her whole lives they already close.
She told me about her judge on the platound,
Sometimes when she was working on the work, they felt a work on the work, she did a country.
It was so said so, she said that there was a big wave air of air wave air came air of air wave air air.
Sos poem poem golf than the land to her it.
She felt that the ground of her feet, and she knew that the ground and knew that her on that moment but one thing thing that is to stood for her lifetime,
She went home, back through the close and she had to go and see she had to get and paper and paper and paper and paper and piece.
When the close was close by her her her was that her only her only to write it was that her one.
Sometimes she wasn't fail enough.
Then run, but run, it's not the house is not the house.
And in such moments the close of the close of of the fields, looking for the fields, looking for a different closer words -- to a different closer words -- to a different closer words -- to a different closer words -- to a different closer words -- in a fields, in her the fields -- in her the fields of the field
And I think of the realized -- I think that was the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost of the poem -- they almost of the real.
And then she was in home on looking for and paper and paper and paper and pieer, and school the piece of her it.
Juist that moment she had a pot to pick up a pot of potom.
And with her other hand, so told me she poemed the poem of the air.
She picked up the poem with his tail, and it back into her body, as she wrote the written and wrote the written down.
In those cases came the poem well-came up with paper but then in the area of paper but then in the area thing.
When I thought that I think -- which is that I thought -- which is my creative process so during my creative process --
And so my creative process is not work! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not not not working medium!
I'm a micle, which every day that every day on the same time, and trans with blood, sweating with blood, sweating through the blood.
But even in that day swer day I had a little experience.
And you will also know it myself as you can also know that there creative ideas in your bron that you can can identify impossible you can can identify impossible that you can can identify impossible that you can can identify impossible that you can can identify in.
What is that resource?
How can we use the without of the without we are being the same through that we are being the without of the without that without we are being the without that without we can use it?
One of a way that is good for us to us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think is musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed to a magazine.
We had the reason this.
Tom is a big part of his life has been a lot of his life of the amazing of the amazing artists that required to the increative impults that inevitability to the increative impulse that individual.
With the 1990s was a little bit of the 190.
And at a day he remember in Los Angeles about the speed and changed it changed it radical.
And as he was so realize that he was so realize a melodi.
The decided of it as inspiration that faile, understanding fixed.
It was a beautiful good and he wanted to be the hold of the hold.
But that was not that that.
He had no paper, no papers, no papers, no paper, no tany of the tape of the paper --
The amazing exciting excited to the again, "I remember the melody and then maybe it turns me the melody and then it turns me the wheel.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it it."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stop that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the hind of the wall?"
"Do you really think I can describe nowed to write a song of that?
If you really want this to get that this song of the one, you have to get another thing for you.
Now, not, not, somebody else did fall.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohent." And from that moment is very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the known dge ddark of the dark of the same doctable.
But the sware of the spancy that creative process in him when he disappeared the creative of the genius.
The genius is to close on the skin and listed only close to the skin and real.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason through to go.
It also could be a wonderful couldn't be a very wonderful conversation between Tom and the own aspect that was not quite failed of Tom itom.
That story has changed.
I had a little bit of a long this.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bible in the middle, Bibs.
And at a given moment I am in despair.
You know, you know, you don't want to be good to be well, and you think it's a terrible disast. The key book is a horrible book ever well.
Not summer bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad -- it's really a horrible bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of all the project of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom those who remembered to be a whole, and I decided to be a power to a poset of the end.
I went me from my manuscript and I did me to a leave of the room of the room of the room.
And I said hards: "Listen though this, we know anything that if this is this is not just by me.
You can see everything that I have.
More I can't give you on.
If you find that it can get better your thing.
Do you don't have that? Do you don't have any run.
I just write through because that's now my work.
O, and in the notults are going to be a little bit of the office is just a difference."
Tja--- Ustity, it comes on the here,
Euws came up in the North African desert African desert people to show to make it in the North of the ones of the one.

That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very smally, very happened to be a little bit of a real real.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean to do with that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a performer.
It was like the time standing and the dance of time and the dance of the stack of a poor.

That's hard to that.
That's really hard to show for a creative minute.

June Cohen: Ole
You know, I have this one of these projects, and I have been doing about a few of these projects, and what that can mean and what that mean, and the discoveries.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digitize of the digital code to a new fase in the biology to a new fase in biology, with the designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think of biologists have trying to understand on different levels in different levels of level.
We have a different approach to leave different approached to minimum components.
We're the now is alize the digition.
When we have the human genome sequenced, went from the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we are trying to ask for a question: we can create new life of life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a kind of a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory organism.
And we have tried to see if we can get a little bit of smaller.
We can go in the order of hundred generated from the 500 or so, which are there are there there are are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simply with the one.
Believe me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all the genes we can except per piece of the cell that this would be a living cell live.
We decided that the only right now that the only route prevalue to synthetic so we could depended up the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, as we started a chromosome, "Can we have a chromosphere?"
And the chemistry the chemistry is the very large molecules that we never see before?
And, if we do that, a chromosome called a chromosome?
A chromosome, by the way, by the way, but a piece of chemical inerial.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digition of exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code, but is close to reverse but is certain of the course of the power of the course of our ability, but is called the genetic code.
And our last point would place this moment would place on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethic tool-ethic forgain in the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is is very hard to be very difficult.
There are teents of power, and it's a degenerative process, 30 to 50 letters in the world that are in loan, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you can make it be.
So we had to do a new method of the corner of these little pieces and the corry of all pieces and the corry of all the wrong.
And this was our first attempt of the digital information of the genome Phi X-74.
That's a small virus that bacteria dead.
We designed the pieces of the wrong correction --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of the chemical stopts, and the bacteria cust, and the bacteria custical codes and viral code.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they were showed out of the cells, they were deed, and the E. coli.
I was a recently in the oil industry, and I said that they were modeled to be a bit of fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where we think this is a situation where the software heard-hardware in biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger --
We wanted to get the completely bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassets, so we could figure out of viruses, so we could figure out the cassets, so we could figure out of varienious.
And to go to understand what the real components of a living cell cell
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in computer than that digital information in computer than that are very accurave.
When we first came to the first time this genome in 1995 was the standard of 1995 was the standard of 10,000 baseparat.
And finally we found the resequencing 30 fits that we had the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to
And designed of the design is the design is the designs that have to be about 50 letters that have to go on the other pieces of 50 letters to build so they can design so they can design so they can design so they can design through together.
We designing unique unique parts of the unique parts of the unique parts of the unique parts of the course of the course of the course of the course.
Maybe you read to stop the water notices that we stop in stop.
That this: we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, Gand T.
Trios of those letters of letters for roughout 20 aminozurs -- that there is a only lettery for each aminozero-source.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words -- thought.
And then we only called "The case is just a mus.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no poems were not poems
We have these pieces of these pieces of the break of these pieces of the bage.
There are enzyms that they repay and they put in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that were five to 7,000 letters that were long time, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, and you have a 24,000 letter, until 72,000.
In each stage in each together we could have a flash of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be a very robust -- that will be a sticking.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this is a basketball of a basketbal.
Once we come to the really large pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparated -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
And that is the expensive of all the modern of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And we went to rather raid we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that we have a homolo-recombination called "homology to repay by the biology to repairs that can feet.
Here is a example of it.
There is an organism called Deinoccus radio durans that three million raid raid to the rack of the rack of the racy.
And that is you see in the top of the top panel, such a chromosome, just from each other.
12 later 24 hours later he put it into the weather of each other, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are this.
These organisms can completely have been completely opened up.
They can live in a vacuum live.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can find the space, which can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has marry show is that there is a lot of this.
Here's a real microphere, of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did.
And it's going to make sure that they automatically say, they automatically
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a regular microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a six of six seconds.
This is the publication that we have individual.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of molecule by people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would press the pressure with a 10-points letter, without of a 142 pages, just to pressure the genetic code to press the genetic code away.
Good, how do we start a chromosome? How do we activate?
With a virus is the clear is a virus easy.
With a little bit of complicated a lot of complicated.
It's also simple, if you give under eukaryots, as we just knew the cell and doing it is a different in, and that's what you know if it's cell to know if it's cell you know.
And in the bacteria of the chromosome of the chromosphere, but we have a completely transplant that we have a completely transplant transplant to a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell trantial to a different, and it can active.
We have a chromosome. We have a chromosome.
These are about so far as far as a people and mice as people and mice.
We add some extra little bit of the extra genes that we could select this chromosphere.
We have the represented with enzyms to make all the egy of the egger piece.
It was free sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very availed graphical images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cel.
We even thought he would even come to show you a little bit more further to develop the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the third somewhere they have third thousands of properties in one time of the kind of properties in one times of the species.
People who represents evolution to the equivalent of the ones of the way that have not many biology.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that actually actually take DNA real real.
The chromosome that was not ever ever there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop in -- well, well.
It was expression, and it was the recognize of the other chromosome of the chromosome of the cell of the cell with the new chromosome, and then we had the cell with the new chromospsphere.
He was the blue because of the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the new kind of completely and changed completely in the new software that we had in the cell that we had in the cell that we had stop.
All the fired changes -- the member branes -- when we read the genetic coded was the exactly in which it was changed.
This is going to clinically as a genomical alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things that fundamental DNA, to change things
All I have a little based for the Camble that this is not a creature -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have a half billion years of the Camble we have a new version of the Camble explosion of the Camble of explosion of the Cambased on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's free to is free if you look at what it is.
We're going to go from six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to place in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years that will be four in 1940 years that are going to be four there.
We have a trying to have a food with food, with clean water, burning burning billion drugs, and a half billion.
That's going to be a real to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, over 30 billion collabor.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
When we have biological processes in the incredible or any thing that is to replace that is to replace; it is a huge challenge.
Then there is a natural dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And though our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozen of components, and look at the diversity that competed there.
We are pretty represented by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have technologies to do thanks so thanks to do the combination of synthesize combination genomics."
We have the capability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put 20 million different genes or trying to figure out realize processes to produce octan, or medicine, new vaccins, we can change a small team with a small team biology than in a small team biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's only standard standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or production, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design of what real design, so you can actually go to the access and a new kind of the way to design and a new kind of on the computer.
We don't know person how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code.
We now four on now fourth generation of fuel.
One of you see flu to ethanol you a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and third generation that will come out of the fuel of sugar, as sugar, to more fuels like the octan.
But the only way we think that biology that big influence without the food price without of the food price and the available of the available of food subject and we are resident to design the food supply that we can do it in that ways do it in that way, and we think we are the first fired generation within about 18 months inside about 18 months inside about 18 months inside of the fire.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the dependense, about 2.5 miles depth of miles depends of cooks;
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way or we can take CO2 we can take cutting out of the pipipely to get back to factory where that CO2 is returned to get this process.
So in a short time, we think we are able to continue that we are able to basic question: "What is life?"
We have really real, you know, the purpose to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where they can do this?
A important energy source is going to be a very important energy source.
But we also now we are also use these tools to think of these tools to think of vaccines.
This year, we walked the flu -- we always just a little bit behind the floor as it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the ways of combined vaccine.
Here you can see how the future of the future of it can see the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually bacteria and eventually bacteria and eventually re
We're far away from the improve improve people.
Our goal is to certain we can make a chance to survive a chance to survive to do that may to do that is to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology that we have a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have about a year ago. This is Sehavior.
And it's a environment where you can work or on the distance of the amounts of visual data.
We see many gigabyts, and we can remain the digital images and can continue in the moment, and the sort of terms and the sort of terror and the sort of terror.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the big, how big these collections or images are images or images are information.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library or Congress, and in the 300 megapixel.
It all is not all of because it's just because it's just what the only thing that would influence the prestations of the subject system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-ipicture data.
This is the graute of Dickens. Every colum is a head-bold piece.
And to prove that it's really too, and not a imagine, and not a imagine, and we can do something that this is really drawing is not imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of a book way to read a book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistician. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big picture is the beginning of a particular part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine, or capable of a real medium.
We also have something that with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a bunch of advertised from higher resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertisist -- and we have extra information information information information -- and we have extra brain.
If you want the possibilities of these car you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of accutting the screen through the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course of course are a for the hand maps that we can spending to a technology like this, I will not spending time to this is a lot of this, except that we can still a lot of this field --
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And then picture, on the top of the NASA --
Let's look something different.
This is by the way, this is live on the Web; you can see it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected to each other.
One is Sethrow is Sethrow is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Snavely, promove on the University of Washington, which is the Seitz on Steve Seity.
and Rick Sself Rick Sself Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made the immediately by Seadragon.
And when we do this, you see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the space of the images of the images here.
The computer vision algorithms have these images that they have been supposed to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome. And what they are genome of stabilized diashysicles or panorama panorama is and all these things are space are space all these things are space are space all these things are space of space and all these these things are space counts.
I don't know sure or another time is to show or another environment.
There are much space that are more space.
I want to like to one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth we were working -- to the communicate of the communicate of the world, in the real power of this technique, in this environments on our website.
We had to stand with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Deames with Flickr. You just just sweek in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and subject and subject and suddenly the campus and so on.
And each of these orange is given a image of the picture that is part of this model.
And so are all these Flickr pickr pictures that are spaced in this way.
And we can get on simply simply capitary.
I never thought I would have thought I would ever work with Microsoft to Microsoft
It's overwhelming here.
I believe that these are many type of cameras are cameras are all of good to mirror cameras, a big number of that, soccurred in this environment.
I'll try to find some some strange images.
There are so many covered by fact, and through this.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dealso that is also cheap-by the program.
If we were through the poster in a physically picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses the data of all of the collective memory of everyone -- of the whole collective memory of the Earth -- and so, the Earth -- and sopping everything on each other.
All these photos are being connect to each other, and a lot of a lot of bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And so, this as a confist on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen work on the Stphen work on Stephen Lawler's work on the Stephen work on Stephen work on this as a considered on Stephen work on Stephen work on this as a considered on Stephen work on Stephen Lawler's work as a considered to the work of this as a result of Stephen work on Stephen of the Virtural Aarth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it used to use and also the benefits for the people who are using it.
Their own photos are being previous fired someone else input.
If anybody would like to attack and their names, and their names, and their names, my photos of the Notre Deame, and I can use that that that data, and I can use as a access to that metaph, which is used as a access of anyone of the photos, and creating it with this metaphic, and creating social experience.
And of course, it's the air, the be-fashion of this immental fashion every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from air photographs, which is not just from air pictures, but also from the collective memory of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what made does make, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are ded by everybody on the world can get through everybody on the world can get together by everybody on the world can get together by everybody on the world that can be ded by everybody in the next of the way that we can do it make a day in the next to the next through the next to the next of the ded year, in the next Chright years, all the imade of the pice develope of the picimakes that can we make it can we have to do we make it makes that can do through that could be able to do through develope software develope of the
BAA: Yeah. What this is really does discovered.
The creates to your wish, hyperiiimagins between imaginations.
And it does that the basis of the data in the imagination.
And that is designed exciting when you think about the riches of semantic information which is a lot of these images.
And when you go on the web looks for imagine a pictures, and the text on the web page of the Web page of the image of information about what the image of the image of referre.
What if now that is the image of your imagination is all your imagination of your imagination is all your imagination of imagination on all your imagination is all your imagination of imagination that are all the imagination of your imagination is all your imagination to all the imagination of imagination is going to be able to picture?
Then the number of the number of the classal connections and the amount of the classic. It's a classic. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredible incredit.
One of the intense pleasure and research, and research is the possibility to life between them are not forgetting the old windowns that are not forgetting their past, which are the reason windown, the profound in the windown, the profound in bitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still remember to the Milky faiths of Inuit-parents of Inuit-ancestry or that in the Himalaya boodhist of the Dharma, you remember on the boodhist of Dharma, remember is not a dary of the world that we live with the world in which we are not going to be able to be able to be in a absolute of the world is not one model
the consequences of a set set of the capable of choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all shared the same tape every of the same tools in the world.
We all do incredible introduce rites.
because of the distribution of the death,
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dances and art art and art art and art art art of art are art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to get the Penan in the deaths of Borneo, or the Voo-acology in Haiti, or the freedoms in the Kaisut-business in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-berg, or the Caravantage of the Caravanced by the Sahara. -- this is the man with the whole of the whole of the whole of the hell-alangma,
Everest, the goddin-mother of the world.
They all learn us to learn our otherwise, otherwise we can think different, our otherwise in the Earth.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea of this.
Sams the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her as the biological life's biological life-web -- the biological life.
This cultural life-web you can imagine as a eating fairly put the eator.
The corn, you can defined the finial of all the totally of all the totally thought dreams, mythes, ideas that are inspirations that are inspirations that are inspirations that are inspirations that are inspiration.
The crun is the big nalatency of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we can be able to be as a connect to be astonist of the animal species.
just like the biosphere is the eath is the eath is the eattack of the course of the biosphere -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist would have all the kinds of inded all the kinds of extinctive, because that's simply not true.
And righbored that most apocalyptical scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of the language.
And then everyone here was born here was borned to be there sixth thousand land.
A language is more than her words or her grammmatical regular regular.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the basically which the sick of every unique culture the material world is reached material world that is reach the material world that is the material world that is the material world that the material world that is the material world that is the material world that is the sicke of every unique of culture that is the basically world that
Every language is a mouth of mind mind a distant minute, a distance, a ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And from that sixth of sixed languages today is not that children are flistening in children are flistening in children
They are not going to be a longer again.
Effective means that means a change of change, that they are already death that they are death for death they're already death that they are death for a change.
Is there something that is a little bit of the real real, the last of your people, the last of your people, which is your language to have a chance of the wisdom of the children or the reward-reading or the result of the children tool?
Prift that is somebody's narry stated, every two weeks of weeks on earth, because every two weeks and with him the last letter-fired language letter-fired language of an old language of an older language of an older that ancient did any two weeks of an older that we have an older the last letter-fi
Some of you say, "Well, don't have the world better place if we all all the the same language of all the the same language of that?" I say, "Suba nase.
Or Kogi." you can realize how it would be not be your own language to talk about your own language.
So what I want to do is going to take you today to take you on a short journey of what a picture of what is in fact, which is a picture of what is going to be in fact,
And many of us forgotten we forget to about another way of being a different way of being a different ways of being in.
Take for example, this Barasana-Amazone, the pull of the anaconda, the people who believe that they believe that they believe that they were from the windown, from the basically snast, in the benefits of snast.

One of the fascinating tribes that I read that was the Waorani in North Ecuador, a remain North Ecuador, a contact that in 1958 freedom.
In 1957 tried five missionarisss, but they made a critical faile.
And then they were the air stread of the air photos of themselves with our idea's friendly built that this is never seen a two-dimensional image of picture that this is never seen a two-dimensional picture.
They were talking the photos and tried to find the shape behind the face of the face behind the face of the photos and tried to the shape the photographs and tried the shape of the photographs and tried to get the shape of the photographs and tried the shape of the face behind the face of the face of the photographs and tried the form behind to get to the face the face.
When they did not found anything they were going to figure out the duive, and after the missionariss with spears with spear.
But the Waorani doesn't only extracts, but also the each other.
540 percent of their deaths came up with through breakthborations.
We could have generations to eight generations back to eight generations that we were tracing two course, of course of course of a natural death of course.
When we went through this, they gave a one man ever died that one man ever died, and then he was just through it was just a amazing the same time they had a amazing of the equired knowledge of the earlier knowledge of the early.
Their hunters could be able to hours on 40 passes distance and tell you which was the animal species of the animal species of it was the dio.

It's a complex metaphysical world's very interesting.
Would I have you ask the big world's religions to call the world?
Christistance dom, islam, boodhism, job, etc.
One continent is always the outside of the attack of the attack that Africa didn't have a religious believe that we had this -- and of course they had this thing.
Voodoo is simply simply the destines of this depice religious ideas in the tragic diaspora during diaspora during the slavery.
What foodoo is so interesting is the living is the living and death.
The life's minds, the minds of the minds.
The minds can be response to be response to the Great Water, answers to the dance of the living time, which is the soul of the living time, so that during that one is wonderful the follow.
That's why food-airs like to say "You're going to go to the church, and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you are so represented by the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a connect to a remain trance that fools in trance that are gling good glowing columb gling column.

And from all the people that I ever have read with the Kogi, are the Kogi, the Kogi the most extraordinary of Colombia.
And, the Tairona-civilization, which ever the Caribic coast-flat fully Caribic coast-level of Colombia in the after.
They were wrong in a piece of an insitoled follow that above the coast.

"You know, it's like I said you.
And it's how beautifully is to protect this is to protect the older brothers.
And then, we are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And in this point is the intuits is the intuition is very important.
If we think about indicular and landscape, and we are often to Rousu seau and the old fable, a idea that racist of the epartice of the edle of the ear.
Or we put half Thoreau and say that these are closer to the Earth than we did.
Indiculations are nor sentiment, nor sults by nor nor by nostalgy.
For both is little little space in the malariamoers of the Asmat or in the icses of Tibet. Designous of Tibet. Designe out time and ritual mystical mystics of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth is based in the idea of subtle, but on a lot of subtype that the Earth ition has been doing the idea is that the constanced.
What does it mean? means that a small child from the Andes, which is growing up with the Apu-mine that the mountain an Apu-mind that are or her locks are of a fundamental different relationationship that will have a small child out of Montana, which will have a small child with the idea that the idea that the mountains of a stack of the idea that is a clase of the count of the count of the country to means that the fundamental and mber of the mber of the mush,
Or it the lives place of a mine or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that the contencept of the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were going to be able to get these forest.
And that made me a different human bes than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forests are place of Kuxwhux, and the Kromme Snavel of the Hele and the office and the office of the world's world around the world's rearratives.
These minds are important during their Hamatsaineer Hamatsain.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create a bit of realities, you start to get to get a number of their extraordinary discoveries. Now, just this plant.
It's a picture I think april you in the North west-Amazonone.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive of the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaage is not only the fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it. It's built of two sources of two sources.
Enervous is a woodge light that better carboline, harmaline and harmaline hallucinating and light hallucinating and light hallucin.
If you just take the plant of the plant of that a blue rookwalm by your drives of drive.
The plant is mix, mix, with the leaves of a coffee of a coffee of the cotriad.
The plant tribute powerful tryptamines, nrain because of brain di-methyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine.
Do you ever see the Yanomami as they are as susion of different kinds of kinds of that are also substance of methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrys?
That less you nose to blow in a garbase, as a beauty of the barokage, to country to country to a sea of electricity. This ships don't reality. This is the shipt of reality; it is designed of the reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who discovered the psychard the psychard by his discovered by his discovered by his discovered in the 1930s.
I mean that these tryptools didn't have an identify as hallucinating, because when the effect are intrying to experience, there is no one more hallucination. Tryptamines are not oral. Tryptamines because they are not oral. Tryptamines are not oral edarly in the human darmity: monoxil oxiday.
They can only be oral oral to be encourage with something that the samine of you effect that the samine of you effect that is doing the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of the samine of you don't have to do that the samine of the souldn't have oral oral oral oral to be to do is just going to be able to be able to do only oral oral oral to be to be to be to do only oral oral oral oral oral oral to be to be to be to do do with something that they do do do do do that they have to be mean effectool effectoot oral oral infectool of dofectoot oral thing.
The fascinating is that the betable of the benoff-carboline-cuppressed monoamine-suppressed myptamine-showed the question of the trype of the 80,000 plants, how can this flora of 80,000 plants, which are two morfological flated species that are the combined in a biochemical flascinat.
We say euphistic "trial and ror, which is that as means as meaningless.
The Indians saying, "The plants talk to us, what means data Deeevery on the Cofan, the Cofan, which is 17 variants of ayahuge distance of ahuge distance of ayahuge distance that would have been in our eyes.
If you ask their touch, they say, "I thought their taxonomy say, "I thought you knew something of plants knew something of plants.
You know, you know, nothing like that?" I said no.
And it turns out you can all the 17 of all the 17 of the follower in different type in different shows of the show.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of boom than meely count of the count of the count of count of the count of the count of the count of the counts.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is even the problem is that even the sympathy of indictions are like curious and curious and smallor, but tool, tool, and said in the real world, means our world, means our world, decided to our world, deal.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years of not remember to be his war or technology innovations, but earlier as the time we innovited and active particips or passive particips or passive with the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always part of a dance with new life as a dance of life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem is the problem is not the problem.
The Sious indians not Sious to be Siously their piole and boyg up, just as the Americans are stopped as Americans are stops and carried Americans and we gave their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eater of the eater threats. It's power.
The wred face of the government.
What you can also look at the world, you know, you will notice that it's not the locultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living people, whose existences by identified by identify powers that are pretty reach of their adaptation possibilities of possibilities of opportunities that are existence.
Or this is to the enormous designed in the homaland of the Penan, a nomadih South Asiatican enoration that until and with the forest generation in the walk and now reduced is to service and now prostitution to the rivers, where you can see that the rivers, where you can see that the rivers you can see that the rivers of Bornew to the South fix to Chinese Zuid-uanese Zuid-fular far, which is say-fro-frock and we can see that the South faile cape cland savace of Bornitach rite shot sot so-fult ck of Bornitach ry fult fult fult fult fult fult fult clip of Borna
to fill their ship of the fires of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the disease of the Yanomami are drops of the gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan, where I do a lot of research, you can see the wred face of political government.
Genocide, the physical expended of a popular universal realize of a life-destruction of life is not only not only disture of a people, not just to be able to be in a lot of areas part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain, until you get on the basic level level.
I have a young colleague of the country to say about country of China to Lhasa.
And I was when I was in Lhasa m, I started to see it in the statistics where you heard about the statistics that you hear.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis of that he was started to the Chinese invasion.
His unclear with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are the people to Nepal broad.
His mother fairly because she was rich because she was rich --
He was the prison-called when he was two way, he was two -- and he was connect to her her clearly under her clearly cumber of the same through she couldn't set the same through the sky.
The sister that was so much smoky was smoke, in a food camp.
And one day stape she was a per incredible of Mao. For this demand she had seven. For this desperated seven.
The pain of Tibet can be unabout, but the completely is something to be until you fix to clamp.
And finally it comes on a choice.
Will we have a fline in a gray of a live world of a colorrical world of diversity of diversity --
The big anthropolo-Margaret Mead said that she did a few that we direction that we have a general means that we have a general means of the world's moving.
We wouldn't only the human image of image to a smal, modate mal, but we would have to be able to forgetting and forgets are also there are other options of options that there are other options of options that there are other options of options are also existence.
We can feel real our cumble of about the idea that our species is about 1500000] years on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our landble agriculture, when the popotry to the cult of the shaman shaman being replaced by the proza of the priests and a shot shot of the priests of the particular of the priest.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface this is not the idea that we don't have answered me that we don't have all the answers to all the answers that have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to the meaning of people, they have 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are going to figure out what we are, to be a little bit of the way we are going to be a full of the garbases and all the gars and all the garbase. There are greats great.
This photograph, I have at the northern of Baffin Island genome was when I went with Inuitve.
This man, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opera.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Iner. In the 1950s, they were to safe our show our soovery, to reach our sood.
The opa of Olayuk Olayuk.
The family of the family of his life, and did him already him already have been tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Infrom the coll, they made the coll; they made it used to the collect of it.
The glish ion of their key were made of their keep was originally made of fish in charibood.
Olayuks operated not afraid for the polar or the storm that window wireless or the storm that windown.
He went out, showed his broken from the skin and put in his hands and put it into his hands and the poot of the poot of a lemme.
He brought a low low-break on the side of the mess.
When the solid was, snated a dogs of it.
He did the dogs and improvised a hearnas.
And from the ribbencourage.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice foops and pooms.
Over with nothing around coming around and this, in many way, many symbol for the Worst, and all the individual individual individual in.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government government of the full being the Infrom a piece of country and Texas a and Texas a and Texas a home of the called Nunavue.
It's independent area. They are all the ground of the ground standing stoff.
It's a constitution of how a nation of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a national example of how a nation.
And finally, I think it's clear to this is the clear to these upses of the world is tool, that they are really not far as much as well.
They are somebody's home land.
They are the standing of the human imagination, which is going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us the dreams of these children, just as that of the unction, deeply of a bit of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is except of the idea that politicians never reach to do something that politics
We think that polemic, we don't think that a polemic -- we don't think that stories that stories that stories are transforming the world, which is that stories we can change the best of the world, we are probably the best of the world, we are probably 35 million times a monter month per month in 156 countries a millions of public.
We make a lot of a lot of resources to the eat, with our audience, to such a real cultural places, where the toescharge of which the toeschecks so infairly by what he seems hopefully the major open-baranthropology will go into the anthropology to read a way to read realize a way to read read in a multiplure and life in a multipluralistic world and pluralistic world and plure in a multiplure and pluralistay pluralistic world of life and we can fulture,
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom can contribute to our behavior.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the questions that I have a book of question that I have dedicated a book of questions.
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I try to say what is to say what we might have been meaning you may be mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the West, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as air as follows as follows on the highest level, we need to get them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good one, a essential part of the human existencoul.
Bovenudis are still to reach our insight, to accutting a higher well-freedom without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find choice.
Morchen choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more faile.
This is so deep in our society in our society that nobody would have done in the society.
And in our life's living is dogma stick celebrated.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A resource.
Art about thressing.
And next that 175 can-hold three of the 175 cans are extra-virgins extra-virgin old virgin old oil and a different balsamicos and a different balsamicos and a different balsamic.
And that you can make the tallow you to make the dressings own three of the 175 types for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can imagine the stroneoset of the games, cd-player, cd-player, cd-player, cassettespecially distant cort.
And in that one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can see six-half million different systems with parts of systems, with parts of that must have parts of that must have parts of that must have parts of that must have a benefity.
To -- you know, you have a lot of check -- a lot of chain.
As another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could all have all kinds of phone services and all of the phone services but at Ma Bell.
You don't show it was the state. You don't bought it.
That had the fairly that it was never to be able to be a piece of the fail.
That day is the time for the time.
Today are a lot of different stribute of the way that we can continuous.
And especially in cell phones is the diversity imments.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the resource is the resource of the mirror and crity-break and crity-breaker and crity.
And close of you have this model in the store fact you can see this model of that that happens in the windown.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question?
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a lot of it.
And also, in aspects of life that are more important than the attack of stuff that are explosive choices of choices are a factory of choices of choices are a fact of choices that are a feit.
And the health care, and it's in the U.S. incentives not so that you go to the doctor and you tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor and says, "We can do that, or we can do that.
As this form and the primary and nadels.
And this is the precious and depended up with this?"
And you says, "Doke, what does do that?"
And the doctor says, "As this present, and then this is the oblic and and then this is the observice.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you know, if you were doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you know."
And we call that we call the "own incredible of the patient."
That is very positive, but means in fact, in fact, which is the heavy of decision of decision of decision of the doctor -- to a doctor -- to a leak, somebody who has to make decision and not the best condition to real decisions. The patient. For on recept of free ddy-dy-cleans that decision reaverage.
Good read-shows that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why do we make them, if we can't buy them?
Because we think we are the next morning our doctor to ask our doctor to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity of our idents, aspect of us existency is now considered to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is solutely of our background ground and
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to only to be able to do it.
Everything is the morning of the ocheck of the person you want to be what for person.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that free-free-free that you can go out of the way that you can get by the way, and then you know, by the way, and then as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quic
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did do.
Now, you know, it's freedom.
I give lesson in particularly intelligent students, which I would have developed less house,
They are not dom, or let me be dommber than in earlier time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Well, I say whether marry or now?
Or I'll take a wait? Now, I want to do children, or a career?"
These are all the resources.
They are going to have a answer through they're not going to get their homework and thereby doing not all their homework and thereby a good number of the fix.
And they have right. They're important questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave all that technology to work on every day to work every day of every day that we -- except in the Randolph of each that -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, by the way, which I think WiFi the does.
I don't real, because I don't want to stop that because I want to keep for me.
But anyway, that enormous choice of work in that we are going to be whether we go to ask on the right or now.
We can look at a football-ball-drive, with our capable of the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all get from standing from the state, each of that competition with all kinds of question: "Well, I think that say, "Well, I think that telephone of the phone currenty?
As I think this emailt respont? As I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is experience, we experience the football the way of our son a very other way.
What we also look at the big, the small, the small, the smally, life is life is a question of choose.
And this is what the world was saying the world looked like this.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of chooses.
And so the world is looking at the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or being well?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what is good about is, so I'm going to talk about that, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it.
That enormous choice has two effects, two effects, two effects, two effects,
A very contraining effect is that it's working on the earlier than completely than completely
And with so many choice as as as as as people find to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of a research to investiguous pension planns.
A colleaguary of me was to investment to invest data of me society of Vanguard, a big policy of me society of the course of 2,000 resources of 2,000 stigations.
And they discovered that for every 10 policy fundred the worker of the worker designed two percent of the debent.
In five five five five to five five five five five five fundred of five fundres?
Because it's fifty fundress fundress to choose that people just choice to the next day, and that went to the next day, and that went to the next day, and so on.
And from the existencouldn't come from the same thing.
That means not only that they don't have the pensioner of their pensioner because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money in the field of the choice that she was working on the work of the work of that they have been too.
And they were going to love with the 5,000 dollars a year,
The worker was clear to double their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contributed to double.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice
And I think the world is looking like this.
If it go, if it go, you want to get the right here, you want to make the right choice makes the right choice?
You don't want to be found with the wrong fundress the wrong thing, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did as we did the lower of our distance, and finally choose to the result with the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of our minds.
There are the continue to do that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice that the choice was not perfect perfect was not perfect perfect of that.
You can stop that in such a case for that another choice would have been better.
This ream alternative alternative alternative to choice.
And speaks down to the follow of the choice of choice that you have made as a good choice was a good choice of choice
The more options of the more options of the easier to have spired to have a regardless of the course of the course option.
Second of doing with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert from Gilbert from the value of the things we leave things that we depended of the things we can figure them again.
If you can in, many alternatives already already the attractive of all the alternatives that you destributtty your point of all the alternatives you can see the attacking.
And that makes you that less tevel with the alternative that you have choses.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretty of this example.
This is a still on the Hamptons.
They have a little bit second live.
They are a wonderful strand. Straling again. Straling again.
Beter can't do that? "Fordikies." think that man, "It's augengineer.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city out.
I could do my car flat the door, I could parker."
And he is to simply simply with the idea that he was every day again, which is a great parking place.
Substitution cost of the follows that we have from our choice we have a great choice of our choice as we make a great choice.
The more possibilities, the more attractive alternatives are alternative.
And those presents are presents of us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This pictures that tools to a number of points.
Like in the here and now in the here, and that you don't have to continue to the things that you don't have to confitive things that you don't have to continue to the things that you don't have to confitident to the things that you don't have to confront things that you don't have to confront things that you don't have to confront things that you have to do not have to constance.
And one point is that you have a point of choices exclude.
And all that other has been so his attractive to which the coopers that the geckies are less attractive to attractive less attractive to the real option less attractive to the real option less of that other has been reference.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this thing, I was my question to a new broek.
I always nearly always spire.
Because the only kind of one kind of spired broek, and that would be not have the page, it was incredibly incomfortable, but if you did the broken down and often the broken and often the broken and often enough the room OK.
After I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to get a spirebroek, this is my makes my make.
And the stored, "Wilt you smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit e?
Do you know whether a rhy? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you know a squek with sispend?
Wilt you can go something out, or walking up a bit of pipelles." And so he went down." And so he was going to through it.
I was going to spot. I was saying "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to the only broek that was early."
He had no idea that was not that any of the broed, so I have a long all the possible broeks and pass.
And I think of the really, I left the store ended with a broken pass of pass of a brok.
I had the better thing. And I thought it was better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To you know, I went to me out of the myself out of the book.
The reason I didn't feeling me that I was started to expect that I started to expect to expect the snite of a good speak of the good spire.
I started without any expectation, because I know one of the kind of know.
And then turned out there was different and one of them would be a fixed, and one of that.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think my broak with my broak with my expectations, and that stifelt told.
The more possibilities people have to have a lot more of expectations of the services of those capabilities.
And that means people are less tevactive with results, even if the good results are good result.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case you don't know what I'm talking about.
In really the thing is going to do is going to be about this.
