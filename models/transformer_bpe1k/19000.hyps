Forig year, I showed these two dias to show that the police cap, who had the last three million years to be about the size of the U.S.
But this is actually the really, the required of this particular problem because it doesn't show.
The ice cap on the North Pole, in a certain sense, the climate heart of our global climate system.
It looks like the winter and crack in the summmer.
The next slide, I showed is a version of what happened is happened to the past 25 years is happened to 25 years is happened to be 25 years of what happened is happened to be happened to the next shows is a version of what happens is happened to show.
The permanence is clearned in red.
As you see it looks at dark to dark blue.
That's the year, it's the year, of the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The called ice, five years or older or older or older is almost like flower, which is almost like flower, which is from the body.
In 25 years is the from this to this get.
And that's a problem because the wideless because the women free around the Northern IJszea very big amount of cool warms a very big amount of cool is invity, when it is cool in methanely, by microbes in methane.
And the total of the total responses of the atmosphere, that could double the atmosphere, that could double the cornity.
In some of the deep of the deep in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.

Whoo! She's OK. The question is that we will be be that will be wrong.
A reason that is that this enormous warming warms "warms Greenland from the north.
This is a smeltwaterriver.
The water than ever ever is before.
This is the Kanger, river, in South South South South Greenland.

These streams are fluence.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And Africance month reported to scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly quickly quickly, with some of the pick of the islands.
The whole continent is standing for six meters of sea currently as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the ones of the largest ice mases, there are now new now, there are new now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drops of that smelt time.
In the Ades, this glass the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared the drinkwater.
In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow.
It's really in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions of reading it.
This global dreamed dreamatic stycupon a dramatic stycle.
And the number of natural around the world is stropty with an incredible and never seen fastrip.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the past 30 years.
This patternal intential invable.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 every 24 hours.
25 miles every day in our oceans, Kook at the ease area of the Stille area of the Stille Ocean, from America, westest and every single day, and every single drastic drastic durning oxygen in the oceans.
One of the only caused of the Earth, next to be farmers -- which is the 20 percent money is the burning of fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem, and it's all the largest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extinures, with China.
And there was a lot of more cities of more cities.
But we see a counter.
These are the cities of the building that the building was the building was annulearning in the last years, and where green alternatives were representation.
There's a political stributed to the gang in our country.
The steone carbon -- and oil industry to gave year, 250 million dollars to promots, which is a corners' strettinue of scale.
And that picture to something like this.
And the chasically, at me to me to me at at at Tennesse, about four billion literer cyclose moded of the cure of believed
You probably have the news.
This is the one-largest display in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising left cool around the Kerstrip was through the Kerstributed thing.
Video: "The Frosty the cool of the cool is a black church.
He's a lot of real inside of the America, and he care about it in America, and he care of that our economy.
Frosty the country to the cool of the day.
He's pay and cumber and cumber and cup.
Here is a big part of the cones of the cool in West Virginia of the courage of the city.
The largest mine of the land is the great big, the big bass of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.

Fit is, cool is not sacred to it.
We find that it's a clean, and it is still correctly certainly certainly certainly --
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me go to us on the go.
Video: Surur: Schone coal, you have heard about heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at these hypermodern cool cool cool cool central.
Fantastic! The machines making a little law.
But that's the sound of sounds of soundation technology.
Thanks the fact that the fact that the burning of the cool causes of the earth causes of the Earth, changes of the Earth, changes the remarkable of the earth,
Look around the country, this is the cool technology of the day.
Al Gore: Einally, past the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that are national security.

The red wire corners is our dependence of fossil fuels, as fiile column, like pull columported oil and inmported oil
But now is a confidence, new solution to this.
And inside America 100 percent scape electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America work to work on the work is a plan that safety that safety that we have the Earth.
Einally, a solution that is a solution of enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontch.
Al Gore: And the last one.

Man 2: New are investments to create good paid paid to create good paid to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tich, to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speak that says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go ago."
We have to go ago, and speed.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promising back to come up with an update about how that machine works.
So here. And I am them. The ones that don't waren: the LHC is the most scientific experiment experiment in the size of the ever science.
It has to be the circumstances that were being were less than a billion of a billion of the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is where I work. It is the one I work. It is called the ATLAS, 44 meter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS, in the agricular so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september in the first time, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party care for a party camerier.
It's a picture of the first particle that helemped around the LHC and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is that detector of the LHC, which is a piece of the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture picture on 10 September we've got that machine works, which is a huge overwhich.
I don't know if this is the largest of the largest of the biggest of this, or then, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page and looked like this.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold.
And those behaviors 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not where. They're too little being tiny tiny being small be."
They can do that because they are superceither of temperature temperature of temperature of temperature of them.
So on myself cool than the gars, they can put the stars, who can be drags, who can be draws that streago.
In one of the constructions between the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, and a constructive.
And that was the wirelectrically warmer, and there was a electrical weather against 13 thousand ample ample of amper resources that 13 thousand ample of them being the wirelectrical against 13 thousand ample of them being the wirelectrically became electrically and against of them became that was one, and ond electrics that was once to the correaks.
This was the result.
This is still inpressioned when you realize that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets more than 20 too, and they were inched 30 centimeter.
We have a sated about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of them, what we did.
We all have them when we all have the parate.
Now, they are back to away.
Eind might be the LHC is going to be intact.
We will put it again, and we expect it against you, or young your further as we can go with the except of the universe.
Now, of course, have the increase of the debate of the value of science starts to research research. It's easy to research.
I think it's so hard to that it's so hard to be hard to go beyond beyone, the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the device of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous Faraday, this is so dangerous than any of human minds, and that our images are not going to be able to take the science, and that our images are not going to be not engineering in nature, and that our images are not completely that we don't have been doing that our being that our experimentation to be not to be not encurvarevironencurritiond experiancame to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be not encurritionate of the sciencuriancuriancurive experiancurry of the
Thank you very much!
I would like to start with you with you to ask to your kids to your kids at your childhood time, when you play with bloce.
When you discovered how you had to understand how to figure, they were actually problems to learn with the decorners with the deplose and remote of space relationship.
And Rum count is strong because of the world to understand with the world to understand us.
If a information, inspired by the nation of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my advisoror Jeee Pattion and my medii -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we would use a computer musical fingers of a kind of digital fingers that information on a platore that we can put in a place fingerence of information with a platitures of digitual foot that we can unning fingenerences that information fingence of fingencured of digities --
and can we have orders like we want to leave it?
This question of us so concerned to search that we decided to search a response of Siftables.
Cort say is a Sift of a response of a cookied of a cookies.
They can be place, they can be moved to each other, they can feel et, their movement and they have a screen and put them a screen and contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands of blocks, they can be place to understand through it looks to understand
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
And so that these resource are a more physical different physical differences are awards, and even of the way we have to movement and even of the way we have to move, there are different new and fun interactions and fun interactions and fun interactions and fun interacts.
I will start with some simple example.
This Sift is institude, to tell a video that shows play that play play and others others played and otherwise can't play anyway.
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious.
Indis next to each other, they will be interests.
And if they are certainly certain and they can be certain cure.
And they feel capacitution.
We realized algaum that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of the interesting of all interesting of everyday as it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little fluid as it was a fluid of the interesting of a little bit of the interesting of the interesting of a little bit of the interesting of the interesting of a little bit of interaction of the interesting
In this picture Siftables of the corners of the corners of the reason to go into a legge where they are human, where they are getting ment.
And if we have threen, we have gone to be back.
There are some of clear capable to education, and pretty play game with language, mathematics and logics where people want to spend people to try to try and the result of the result and result the result of the education.
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a simple calculating programmmatic programmmatic calculating programmmatimatter.
Here we show you a game between a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have a wonderful around a letter around a letter letter around any Siftable, and rememed words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is becoming to remember, and different a new series of letters with breakable opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I closed them to make it out of the video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people nearly have almost not nearly instructions need to need instructions of these applications.
Everything you need to say is "Make the word," and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people on the test.
That's our young benefits of the right now, right?
And it seems that he just the Siftables that he loated the Siftables of stack.
For him were just bloces.
Here is a interactive paintings of the interactive paintings.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the course of the Sift with that character of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table to the caps.
Here he leave the sun come.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good though! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shape of Siftables and the next to each other, he can response the characters of responding to each other: Weal!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a course.
and he decided how it is walks.
Video: The cates air.
DM: The last example I will show today I will show you that is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have every Siftables a sound sound product a sound product like the lead, based based like the lead, based bass and drum.
One has a different variations, where you can buy choose what you want to buy your every much you want to use it.
These sounds can be increated in Siftables are injected so that you can determind the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern of a legge Sift of a legge Siftable effects that are live controlled effects and filter.
They're being to a sound and attack and attack by can.
And before the general effects like tempo and entire patterns of the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a leaad placed in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a very first pattern by an extra lead.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: Now I feed what slaghtly slaghtly
Video: And I now the filter of the drums, so I can influence the effect of live influence of live influence.
Video: M: I can accelerating the object by the obo of the tempo block you.
Video: Now I buy the filter to the basically on the basically for what more expression.
Video: M: I can re-avail.
And I don't have to plann, so I can't improvisers, but I can improvisers, the getting very longer and shorter corter like I want.
And used to finally the dims of the end, by the entire to the left Siftill to the left left to the left left to the left left to the left show.
Thank you.
As you can see passion, my passion to make a passion of new people, common the way that our brains better interfaces that our brain and lightly work.
And today, I had the time to you one new element in this design area of design area of possibilities that we develop the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the touch is just to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world as we want to leave it.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you all all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and I look at all and I look at it.
I'm writing.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My life of life long I am not going to change and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there is understand a little bit happened in my life and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career to see
And it started with a book that I have written understanding a memoire: "Eten, Biddy, Biddy, that very work to my first work to my first work on the whole work about the whole work about the world and a international stoppancorrectord.
The consequence is that people are always of all and always teged to be called me as as as I was as as as as as as as I always have to be called and always ago.
Worly, where -- you know, gottor.
People come to me and ask me and ask me and ask you and ask you ever ase this success, "Ben you don't ever ever ever ever even?
And you don't have a bang that you are going to be entire life writing but never expensive to warm where people are going to be heating warm where people are going to be heart public?
And you don't have a bang time?"
Excorrecordinary you know.
Of course, that would be a teenam that I remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenage of a teenage -- if I told that I wanted to be write 20 years ago.
And people said, "Do you don't have a bang that you never get never success?
And you don't know about it.
And you don't know that you are living to the work of this work without that you have to remember and you will strong the corner of your broken dreams with your broken dreams of fail?
Something in that streaking.
And in the short comes to the questions of this questions that questions to this questions of this: "Yeah.
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are called
Always of it.
But I also much other things that is a lot of other things that we all know for all of it.
For sea sea weak of sea weak of things.
But what is writing write to write myself the last time that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that someone is to be eight being the work for work for work for the work for the work for the operator?
What is so there is so except to creative processes to creative processes to create the effects of the effects of the mind of the way that is not happening to the way that is not happening to the point of the point that we don't have to be able to create the effects of creative processes of creative processes of
Take my father. He was a skulty engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he worked on the 40 years that he has not been asked for it.
And so from "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so was not talking about it.
To be fairly to be engineers have to be engineers have not been reputation to the reputation of manical depressive alcoholist.
Scheters writers writers.
Not only writers, also other creative people have reputation to be instability, instability.
Look at the grimble doing the grimble doing the most magnifical creative minds the 20th century.
And many of stiped young, often through own to do it.
And even those who don't have a self-moord moorn under to be cup.
In the last interview for his death for his death said, "Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's quite what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of inside we don't look at any more.
We all have the before before and have the set of the cepted with the cepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is indicated with line and that is an artist-stendly available to certainly to certain.
And that's why do I want to ask everybody here today, can you ask with that idea of life?
Do you know that OK?
I think about that I think about a good about navail, I don't think about the prettty though.
I think it is the reason the reasons.
And also another dangerous.
I won't like to see that this century this century.
We can creative minds a lot of better in.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for particularly dangerous life.
Some corred the fase where my career now is now involves now in my career right now.
Go only after young, I'm still young, again.
I can be work to be four decade.
Home probably will be what I have now publish to the outside of the outside world as the work that outside of the extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends on each other, so I can be clap you focus: high-probably lightly behind me.
And Jig, what a idea!
If you think about that, you know, you're going to think about the morning to the morning to the next hours to the drive edge of the drive edge.
So I don't want to this.
I love me love with the work where I love with the work of wood.
And the question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after a long after the conclusion that I can just go through with writing a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a securrice distance between me, and my over, and my overwho's very understand my over, and my over, and my over, and my overness of the reactions of the response.
I have the last year, I went to ways that to do that.
I have in the history and I have references and have results to see if others have found or others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative to help creative process.
My searched me to me, with me brains of the old Greeks and Romines.
Laop, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Gred and believed that creativity was not creativity was not that creativity was itself.
And I believed that creativity was a good mind that creativity was a good place of a very, unknowledge place and unknowledge.
The Great nated these tremendous of creativity "demonen."
also Socrates believed that he had a demon who had a demon who had a demp that words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of same idea.
And in them called them called a geniused to be a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, with a genius,
In their policy was a geniusion was a magical godary that operated in the wure of the artist of the artist of the artist state.
A little bit like Dobby the home-home-home-homet.
If the artist of work was the genius,
And the way he gave form to the work.
Brilliant! That's precise the wrong where I had the first one talk about the psychological protect of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is going to work on his work.
And the artist, in the artist, in the protection of narcism.
If you brilliant work there, you got to be there.
Everybody knew that is an invisible geniusible genius.
Well, you know, you work on the work on you, that doesn't just have to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inprimary genius.
Long time is that the Westen creativity was being creativity was being the West,
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed it.
There's a very new idea of new idea: the individual humans is the resource of the universe and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, attributed from the godary world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity came from the individual food.
And for the first time in the history was about artished artist of artist and they were not a geniused to be a geniused to have a genius.
I have to say that I have to find that a big faile.
To one person, one person, one person, one is to let me believe that he or she or she saves or she saves the earn of the eternal mystery of eternal mystery of everything that is to a far responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
And, if you ask someone ask the sun in click corners.
Egos are being representations and increating increase and increating increating increating prestations of prestations of prestations
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artist stands of cape made a lot of artist of artist of artist cape of artist purpossible of artist that these drugs are made the last 500 years a lot of artist stributty of artist purpose of artished privices.
And if that is that this is that so is the question: "What now what now?"
Can we do?
Can we understand back on an older understand the creative between the relationship between the humans and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the 18 minutes of the 18 minutes of the real message of the rational humanism rational might not have about 500 years rational rational might rational rational might rational humanism rational humanism rational humanism r
And probably them, in the audience of people who have realized scientific driving the idea of that edge physics of the feeditions of artists with some feeding the work of artists to inspirit of inspiring heights to inspirit of inspiring head of the inspirit of inspiring inspiring head of the feeding of art
It doesn't seem to me.
And yet I wonder it wonder it.
Why not?
Why would we have not been thinking that thought to next?
The fast is that much highly highly corporation of the totally calculators of the totally inculatornity that decided to creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit has to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process of the creatial process of the creatial process of the engineering of the engineering of the any of them --
That sometimes almost paranormal.
I have understand the great American directional American directional Ruth Stone Stone of the great American direction.
She is close in the next. Her whole lives they write.
She told me about her right-right?
Somes, if she was work on the work was work on the work she was a poem of country.
It was, as if there was a big wave air, as if you came to rock air air.
Some poem golf than the country to her it.
She feeling that the ground, under her feet under shaped and knew that her on that moment only one thing that is to do is to standing for her life.
And she went to home, back by the poem and she had to see so quickly and packly showed and packs.
When it was close by her high-came waves that was her only her only her only to write it on the write of it.
Sometimes she wasn't next.
Then right and running and running it doesn't reach the house of the house
And in the moments of the close of school close of soil through the fields, looking for another directionary -- to another direction.
All of the story of them -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the poem of the story -- they have the poem of the story -- they almost mistake.
And then she was looking for a search and paper and piece it was close to them.
And Juist on that moment had a potoment.
And with her other hand, so told me she poem the poem of the air.
She packed it back to his stiped and it back into her body, and it back into her body, while she wrote the back and written the back and written it again.
And in that cases came the close of piece of paper and piece of paper and piece, but then in the wrong ordinary.
When I heard that heard -- what I thought -- what happened to be explore my creative process of creative process
That's what my creative process is not work! I'm not medium!
I'm a musile, who are every day on the same time, and the same time, and swer with blood, swood, sweet and trans represents.
But even in that day I had a quareas, I have a experience.
You can also know it will knowledge that sense that feels creative ideas in your brain relies you can impossible you can impossible that you can impossible that you can identify that you can also know that you can impossible that are creative ideas in your broidentify and you can also know that feeling involved to identify it is that feel kno
What is that they brone?
How can we use the without that without we have become we be?
On a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think about this, I can think is musician.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the thought about this.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been a great of his life had been crivers of the great that power to get all the power of the power to get to the uncontinue to the uncontinue in him.
And the years was the 1990s,
And one day, he read in Los Angeles about the speaway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard there, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to him, as inspiration that faker is doing ungratiture.
It was a beautiful good, and he wanted to the fasth.
But that won't be that.
He had no papierty, not a piece, no taperecorder to be its on the other.
And the great familiar again, "I remember is "I remember the melody of the early century and then it turns me to me.
I'm not good enough, I can't be able to be it right."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the wall of the wall?"
"Think you now a lot of you can write a song of the writ?
If you really want to get this loth, you have to later another one of the time, if I have time for you.
Now, it's not going to fall the way again.
Go neighborhood-neighborhood." And from that moment in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonar.
The work itself is still the dark of the dark of dark understanding on the dark of the dark itself is the same through the dark itself is the same through the dark itself is the same through the same through the s
But the sware exciting that creative process in him corner him in him and purpose of the genius.
The geniused to close and the close and liver, only just close to the skin and along the skin and liver,
And to realized that there was no reason to go to reason it.
It also could also be a wonderful cornership, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that didn't really have a gone of Tom himself wasn't quit.
That story has changed my way of work has changed to work on the way of works.
I had a little bit of course.
I was at the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle.
And I think about a spending moment I am in speak of whether or or a few of moment in speak of the spot of a spaper.
You know that won't work to be work and you think it is not good and you think it is a difference.
Not six, really bad bad of the bad of bad bad bad of the bad of the bad of bad
I wanted to put the whole project all the project of the project all the project of the whole project.
And then I remembered Tom who was to be currending, and I decided to be a power power to way.
I wish of my manuscrips and directly and directly to me a lot of the room of the room.
And I said heard "Lister thing, we know everything, we know everything, we know that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop of what I have in the stop I have in the stop of what I have in the stop of the what's in me.
More can't give it.
And if you find that it can, you have to do that, you have to do this.
Snap you don't you that, you're not that, right?
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notor, and in the notory of the office of the office of the office of different."
Tja--- United it comes on the nerves of the corred of the course.
Euws ago, in the North African desert African desert people together to make monlight to make months of music.
One and hours and hours back, to the morning.
That was always that because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometime, sometime, sometime, there was something happened to be a little bit happens.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you know, you know, what I mean to be thought to a little bit of them as a such of a performer.
It was like the time the dance of the time and the dance of the dance,
He didn't did anything else the thousands of nights, but now faile.
And the policy he didn't have a humans.
In him, under him, under him, under him.
A good fired down through him.
If she happened to be happened to be able to clap and they started to clap and clap in corn, "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because that was for them.
By the way, a fun of historical fact you: When the Moren Spange Spange Spange Spange Spange Spange of Spange they have this common with it.
The quote is real real real is being "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, other, oy."
That hused to your mind today in the day of flaments.
If a artist, in Spance a magical or magical does, "Allah, OK, oil, other, oil, other, Allah, other, oyer wonderful."
And understand equipe, a glip of God.
Precipies what we need to need it.
Last, Lastig is that the dances of the following morning to the corners that he didn't have a good charge of the morning of the morning law.
And that moment is he has a little bit of every high-courage man with depends that may never ever ever ever ever come to such more to such more of the such that may be never to such that moment is going to be never before a little bit of ever being a little bit of ever be
Maybe there will never be anyone of God attack at the time.
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to real purpose to creative mind.
But so need to be need to be able to be not to be to be able to be not to be to be able to be the point to be need to be it.
And imagine not going to be inorormous aspects of your person aspects of your person comes from yourself.
Imagine you believe, you know, you know, they have a while, you know, you have a while, to specificate a not specificate of a not too specificate.
When you are ready to you, they are given to someone else.
That's what protect is everything.
I handle instances that thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book that inside of a book that inside of the book where much to reach a lot of reach reach to be looking at is expensive to be invity.
The opportune of that illustrenerous precision.
And if my thought with me on the hall, I love to me the same thing, I don't know the same before. She doesn't have the opposition.
And just the true of the work.
And just just like this, you just do this, what it is.
If the task is to dance, you know, thance.
And if the godary that you is you have to decided to decided to be work on one of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources by legal sources, "Ol.
And it doesn't happening then, thank you very much like that.
And also than: "Ol!
I believe that believe that.
"Ole anyway, how it because we pure from pure human love and own education, and own education.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have a couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and the discover gence.
We actually started to go to a new point, we were the biology of the digital code, and now we try to digital code, and now to a new fase in biology close in biology and synthetives.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living of life?" is something that I try to understand to understand to understand on different levels on different level.
We have different approach approach to minimute, the back to minimum components.
We're now going to be able to digitalize the digitalization.
When we have sequenced the human genome sequenced, the analog world of the biology, to the digital world, to the digital world.
Now, we try to ask your life regenerate, or we can make regenerate new life, or we can create new life universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome to a kind of a sort of that can be contultimultiply in a laboratorium.
And we have trying to look at a nonce if we can get a nonce smaller genome.
We can get in the order of hundred geners of the 500 or so that are there there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that is relatively relatively with the one.
Gelef me, this is simple to that.
But when we look at all the genes we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes of the correct that this would be a lived cell lived cell cell live.
We decided to be the only only that the only route pretty this chromosphere, so that we could have the components to the components to be so the components to ask the one of the most fundamental questions to ask the one of the most fundamental questions to ask this chromospeed to ase this chromospers.
And so we started with questions like "Can we started a chromosphere, "Can we have a chromosphere?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never have never seen befor?
And, if we do that, can do that, a chromosphere?
A chromosphere, by the way, but a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of italize is on exponential well.
Our ability to write the genetic codes lose to write the genetic code, but is increated to be ence.
And our last point would be the last point to a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethic ethical ethic ethic away.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a piece of the piece of the right now.
So we needed to make a new method for the corrating of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the phance.
And this was our first pogget, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi X174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the wrong correction.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the bacteria when we piece of chemical stopts, and the bacteria of chemical code, and viral code, and viral particles and make viral particles of good.
The viral particles were solutely from the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and deaths and death the E. coli.
I was understand with the oil industry, and I said that they have a bit of good snaps.
They laughts more than you.
And that's why we think this situation where the software in which is the software heard ware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much larger thing.
We wanted to build the entirely bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we build them in cassetts, and cassetts, so that we could build the cassetts.
And to go to understand what the deaths of a lived cell of a live.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information is very accura.
When we first at the first time to the first time, in 1995, the standard of the standard precision one of 10,000 baseparats.
And finally we found after we were resequencing 30 folates. And if we had the original sequence of used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start outs.
And the design of the design is the designs of pieces that are 50 letters that have to read with 50 letters of the other pieces of 50 letters to build out of 50 letters that we need to design so they can go together.
We designing unique unique unique supply understanding here.
Maybe you have read to stop water that we have water in stopped them.
Beusus: we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for back 20 aminozurs -- that there is a only letter, for every aminozero-ozurrent.
So we can use the genetic code, and writing the genetic code, thought.
And in the course of course, we just came to be a mom.
Some were called to be close that there were no poems were not poems.
We have these pieces that designed them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and they put them in each other.
And we started to make piece, to start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters of 7,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, until 72,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 72,0000.
And every city, we have a continue of these pieces of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process of process -- that will be very robuobject is that will be a results.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this is from a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball.
And as we come to the really big pieces of the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparated -- then they don't grow easily in E. coli.
And that is the expensive of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologous recombination," which is used by the biology to repair DNA that pieces that pieces can feet.
Here is a picture of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodio.
And you see that in the top panel, they just clear chromosphere, just the chromosphere.
12 obvious later at the back of the each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms that are thousands of organisms of thousands of organisms of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms of organisms of organ
These organisms can be completely opposition.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can find move, a new aquatickly find to be able to find a new aquatickly find
NASA has marries shows that there is a lot of of of them.
Here's a real micropphere, of the molecule, that we have made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- fact with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right world where we did them in the right world where they were in the design.
And Great all, it is that they automatically feed.
This is not an electronen-microscopppphotograph; this is a common microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule, that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish we invent outside of the publish.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule, with humans, with a clear structure.
The molecuular weight is more than 300 million of three million of it.
And if we would pressed the crupt of the 10-points letter, without of the punty, there is 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code age.
Good, how do we start a chromosphere? How do we activate?
And with a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria bacteria of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you live under eukaryots, like us, and you just just the celkers and doing the cells and doing another in, and that's what you know if it's knowing the cell of the cell.
And in the bacteria of the bacteria of the bacterial integrated in the cell of cell, but we have a full transplant transplant transplantation of a chromosplant to a different, and it can active.
We have a chromosphere, we have a chromosprened.
These are about that far as a humans and mous as people and mously affected as people and mouse.
We foogs that extra little bit of the engineering for this chromosphere.
We have the represent with enzyms to make all the egs.
It was pretty when we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the cell -- and you will be call of the cell images here, the new chromosphere, the new chromosphere.
We even thought he would come to be able to develop the process of the process that was to develop process to develop the process of the process of beyone.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of course that have a second chromosphere, or a third of third somewhere from third thousands of properties in one times of the species in one times of the species.
People who are evolution evolution equips are not a lot of biology have not much biology to be a lot of biology comes to be a lot of biology that are equiped to be evolution evil.
There are enzyms who are enzyms who are called DNA distical real.
The chromosphere, in the cell has not each it.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stop in -- well.
It was expensive the other chromosphere, and the reframe, and it was the other chromosphere, and why we had the ended with the new chromosphere, and why we had the new chromosphere.
He was blue because he was stopped the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in the end.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the one of the coarts, and changed the new species of the new species of species and changed on the new software that we had in the cell we had stopped in the cell we had stopped in the celed.
All the way, the membrans of the mbrans -- when we have the genetic code, the genetic code, it was the precise.
This is what may counts like genomic, but we are in state, but we are in the state, by change of the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental
Good, I have a little bit before this is not a citchation -- this is not a cape of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have better that maybe we have to almost a new version of the Camblic explosion of the Camblic explosion of the Cambased on this digital design.
Why would you do?
And I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what you look at what it is.
We are going to get insixtly from six-half to 9 billion people, for the next 40 years.
To it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for every of us who lived in 1946; within 1940 years will be that there are four before.
We have a lot of food, with the corners of soon water, medicine, brandstribute for the six-half billion.
And that's becoming to do that.
We use five billion cools, more than 30 billion of five oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we have biological processes in ogencless than any percent than any process to replace that is a huge challenge.
Then of course there is that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere comes back in the atmosphere is come.
And by our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see that if the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozero had a dozeros of components, and look at the diversity that is coming from the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronics.
We are pretty being a biological reality and our imagination,
We have now have now dank fast, and that is called "combination called "combination genomics" methods to do called "combination.
We have now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put to the replacation of 20 million different genes think, or try to optimalize octan, or medicine, we can do with a little vaccines, we can change a little bit of team biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or production, vaccine, vaccines production, and so on.
This is a screen imagination of what real designs where we work on the computer, so you can go to the global of the computer.
We don't know how to see how it will see it.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We are now now we are now on fourth generation are fourth of the generation of fourth generation.
And you have a bad to ethanol ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and third generation will come out of the inside of the next more high-digor, to more high-digitors like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have biology without the food price without the food price and the available of the available of the food and designs of the food, and we think that are increated to design, and we think that the first generation that we are doing the first generation of burnation in the way in the month of 18 months of making in the massive months.
And slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles deep, and five miles eternitute.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy as energy source.
We are looking at the corporation or we can take corporation, which is easy via pipe of pips where that CO2 is that CO2 is currently again, to brandstribute this process.
So in a short time, we think we are thinking that we are in the corners of basically asking, "What is life?"
We have really have been realize -- you have the purpose to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where they do that?
A important energy source energy source.
But we also work on the way to use these workings to think about fast,
This year the born of the border, we always just behind the facts of the right vaccine.
And I think that can change through tested vaccinated vaccines.
Here you see how the future of the future of evolutional tree is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eukaryota.
We are still away from the improve of people.
Our goal is sure to sure that we make a chance to survive enough a chance to survive enough to survive that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology that we want to show you is to a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have been browing about a year ago. This is Sedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a curring environment that you or on the immense of the amounts of fundress of visual data can work on the way that you can work on the way that you can work on the way or that you can work on the way or that you can work on the way you or with immense units that you can work on the way you or that you have local data can work on the
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can keep up here, and maybe invital inside of the corners and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of digital images and the sort of digital images and then maybe in, and then you have a lot of gigabytes of digit
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images or images are being images or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a picture, but this is a bit of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of megapixal camera picture.
It all doesn't matter because it would be affected to influence affect influence on a screen system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image data.
This is a graute of Dickens. Every collect is a heavail.
To evidence that it's really text to be able to show you that this is not a picture, to show that this is not a picture of the picture.
Maybe this is a little book of the way to read a book way to read a e-book.
I won't take it.
This is a realistic, realistic. This is a example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper age paper or or or caps, which is actually a scale medium.
We also have something about the corner of these extinue of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertised of advertised -- much higher than a normal advertising advertised -- and we have extra lot of information information
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can do really real real that we can do the limits of hands of the screen through the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other through flauweck and other through flaure.
Of course of country to the hand for the hand put on a technology as these, I don't want to spend time to this is a lot of time that we can still much more behaviors.
These are all the weaks in the U.S.
And the top of the top of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is marries now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and it's a very nice piece of computer vision and vision of Washington of Washington the University of Washington, deeply by Seitz on U.Washington U.W.
and Rick Smself-ki with Microsoft Research. A beautiful of works.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragonon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has means here.
The computer vision algorithms have been brained to the real pictures of the real -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are taken -- and all these things are panorama ples of stabilized diase of these things are space counters.
I don't know sure if you have time to show you another environments.
There are much more space.
I like to do to a Noah's noriginal data sets of the data sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that summer that summer is the world that I have been working in my head of these technique force of the environments on our website.
We need to have to be calculated with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, with imagins of Flickr. You can just go to Flickr, and you get images in Flickr, and you get images of people in trips of the shirts, and the campus and thought and thing.
And every of these orange chains a picture of this model of this model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of the model of this orange picture.
And so these are all Flickr pickr pickr pickr picks, which are copped on this way to be copped in this way of space.
And we can have on simple wish wish wish and we can close
You know, I never thought I had ever thought I ever thought to Microsoft with Microsoft of Microsoft of that.
It's overwhelever it to be so much to be so much to be so figure out here.
I believe you that these many types are camera's camera's being good to the mirrors of the good number of eras, a great number of this,
I will try to find some images.
There are so much more discused by and through it.
And the guys of this is what is really a series of photograph -- here.
This is a poster of the Notre Daame of the Now, that is cheapply of the program.
And if we have the poster in due, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things to the social environment. This uses now is the data of the whole collective memory of the entire collective memory -- and buy the Earth -- and buy that everything to each other.
All of these pictures are resource, and form a very larger than the soments of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth.
And that this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawer's work this as a follow this as a ful.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use, and which is the contains of the primary of the people who used to use it.
Their own photograps are being metaphor-data that someone else data that someone else of the metaphor.
If someone would like anyone of these heils and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Dase, and the photograph of the Notre Day's pice that can use metaph, used to that metaphold of anyone of crum and creating a kind of croptory of crue modal, and creasing a kind of cruic social social social social social social social social social social social varial social social social social social varial varial soc
And of course, it's the bi-product put a immental virtual every interesting place on Earth, who don't just get aerial interesting to Earth, who are not going to be able to images and other pictures and otherwise of the collective memories and other.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I start to do that what your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are ded by everyone of the world can be coperating the world can buy together on the world can buy together to pick on the world together?
BAA: Yeah. What this is really discovered.
And the creates creates your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it doing that basis of the data in the picture.
And that designs is exciting when you think about the riches of semantic information that is a lot of these distributty information that many of these discuse.
When you look at the web looking for imagins, you can see a search in the web and the text of the web page of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of information about what the image of picture.
What if you pick that picture is to all your picture?
Then the number of the number of the cornitude, and the amount of right that comes from the classic network-fect. It's a classic network-effect.

They can be only be alonly being the monoamine of the samine of you don't know that.
The fascinating is that the better carbolines in the limb of the major of the corred monoamin, and you know, the tryptamine of the tryptamine of 80,000 planning the question of two morning of morning of two morning to be fological varians of two morts, who are invented species that are going to be a biochemical varians of the before of the part of the sharing of the parts of the part of the shorribuilding of the bity?

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of some questions that I have a book of the book of a book of book a book of course.
Maybe you can see parallels with information from other sources.
And even try to explain that you may that you may be called that you may be means that you may be called that.
And I want to start with the official dogma."
To be precisele: the official dogma of all wester, industrialized called the wester, industrialized together.
And that official dogma dogma like follows like follows on the highest levels on the highest levels on the highest level, we have to give them as much possible freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a big, a big, part of the human existence.
And then the venue still is freedom to reach our own insight, to reach a higher greater shows without of thing.
And the ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more freedom.
This is so did to be become a deep of our society that nobody would have been during in our society.
That also alive in our lives of life is a breakth.
I will give you some examples of our choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A resource.
Even thressings.
And now that 175 can-hunt dressings are in my supermarket tions are extra-virgin my supermarkets extra-virgin olicial balsamicos and different balsoil of balance.

So that's the touch the primarket.
Look at electronics -- you can imagins. You can imaginary your stroneoset of the correcord-player, cassettespicture, corresponsettespecially
And if you can cool that one electronics you can choose out of this attack of this attack.
You can six, you can six-half million different systems with subjects, with subjects, with subjects.
One -- you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could go to your whole all kinds of phone dists ask, but only to Ma Bell.
You don't have the straight being it. You don't check it.
And that had the presentation that it never ever ever piece of thing.
That time is pretty time.
And now, the today, very much different stributtter.
And before cell phphones is the diversity imment.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the mediure, with middle -- who have with mid-play game and crate, letter.
And you know, certainly wink you very much in the wink of the wink of his minds that happens invitable.
The consequence: people are come to the wink and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer on that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a possible that doesn't do a lot of it.
All of the aspects of life that are much more important than the point of spully, is this explosive increase of choices of choices a fact of choices of choices that are a few importantly more important than the point of spulling life that are much more important than the possive of the spular of the spular eeither than the corn.
Suncare -- it's in the United States -- it's in the United States that you have to go.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says thought, "We can do And, we can do it.
A has this police and after that.
And I have this police and after?"
And you say, "Daker what?"
And the doctor, "As this police -- and applies, and To, and then this policy and telling this obvious.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dakter, if you way, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you."
And that call we call "own increating the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, the sware tasking of decision of the corners of things -- the doctor, each other, eat a leak, each and not the best condition to a sick and not the best condition to re-clude cks.
Good protect sleed, because the purpose of the cap, because the purpose group, you can't buy it.
Why can't buy cools, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to be the next morning our doctorrown, to ask that other notice to ask that other notice that other notice of medicine.
And our identity, yet of us existing aspect of our existence, is now over, as you can see on this dia dia slights, like you can see on this dia slightly seeing of our identity,
Our identity, our identity,
We find ourselves -- so often we want to get to this.
Every morning to the opposition you have to think about what you want to be person you want to be there.
Let's talk about the house, the crazy of the crive.
There's a time that freedom, everybody else that you know, you know, you know, if you were as quickly as possible as possible as possible as possible of children staron.
And the only real choice, not when and what you did and what you did do.
Now, the way you have freedom everything for the open for the opportunity.
I give you leave to intelligent students, which I have 20 percent minder house, less house, early than ever asy.
They're not going to be domber or airly time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Well, all I married or not?
Or I am wait? Now, I am to children, or a care?"
These are all the time.
They are going to have a answer to them, also they don't have all their homework and they don't get to work and there's no good corred of that.
And they have right. They're right.
And then we get to work. Carl gave to work. Carl gave to work. Carl takes all the work. Carl put of every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph How do piph How do polic.
There's a place place, which I mean, where WiFi the gotts.
I don't faile, because I want to keep that place for me.
But good, that huge choices of work in that we have a work in that we are going to work on the right now, whether we are going to work or now or now or not.
We can look at a footbalwish of our son the one of our cell phone, and our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and went to school.
And even if they all standing from them, are we all all all the minute of that wedges of that wedged with all kinds of question?
And I so, all this emailt mail response?
And even if it's answer "Ne" -- experience, we experience, we have the footbally, very other way.
What we look at it in the cave, the smally, materialist busines: life is a question of choose is a question of choose of choose is a questions.
That's what the world is wonderful out there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices,
And so the world is now looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bage?
And the answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
That enormous choice has two effects, two effects, two effects on humans.
A very contribute effect is that the first first ones is working than completely freedom.
And with so many choices are invented to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investigures in friends in freedom.
A colleaguary of me got to invest to invest data of Vanguard, a big policy designs with about 2,000 feet of course of the worker of 2,000 feeditions.
And they discovered that for every single of every single fundressed the work-fundressed two percent of the engineer.
Fiftile fundred of the fundress worker than five fundressed with five fundresh of five found?
Because it to fify fundress of fundress is to choose the choice of choice and that opened out of the next day, and and that are down and that are down, and so on.
And of the extenance comes away from the straight comes away from the straight comes away from the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight comes out of the straight comes out of the straight comes out of the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight come.
And that doesn't mean that that people are after their pensionary not just dream to eat the pensionary because they don't have enough money and the choice of the choice of the choice of them that they have been working for the working for them.
And they lots of them to go to 5,000 dollars a year, years to go to their nose.
The work-foot was reaching to double their own contribute their own contribute to double.
So a lot of choice can work with a lot of choice.
And I think the world there's so sick of that.
If it to be the century to the century, you want to make very love choice, right?
You don't want to be capitched with the wrong fundressed fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the flost of our distribution and eventually less texty less texty less texty than the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of our correcords.
There are members to feel reasons.
A through of them is that there is a choice, for example of the tools of the choice, remains that the choice doesn't perfect perfect way.
You straight be in that case, for that another choice would be better.
This ream alternative so.
And then does expensive to the following of the choice that you have made that you have a good choice.
And the more options of them are easier to have a lot of inequired to have an understand every eight every eight be opy.
A second reason has to do with substitution.
Then Gilbert gave from the morning of how often we depended on the value of things we have to compared them.
If you can invite lot of alternatives you can also see all quickly quickly have the increations of all alternative you wish.
That makes you have less text with the alternative that you have cooks.
A image. For the example. For the New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streak of this example of the example of this example of primary example of this picture.
This is on the straight in the Hamptons.
They have a pure second wound.
They are stated to a beautiful beautiful again. Gone ment.
Because you can't do that? "Fordikic," thinks that man, "It's augglo.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I could do my car flack for the door,
And he is too two weeks to simply weeks that he every day and every day of the idea that he is made a great parking of faile.
Substitution.
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative.
And those presentates us as substitution.
Another example of the example.
This pictures of the picture.
Life in the here and now and now that you don't have to continue to continue off.
Another thing is that you have to every choices of choices.
And all that other has been so his attracks, which is the coshows option less attrackly remote involved in the corners.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came to this, in my search at the search to a new brow.
I always nearly speak to always speak to always
And early only one of the kind of speek, and that cows you came to thing. It was incredibly unbelievable, the broke of the broke long enough the broke long enough dream, and often often the right and often often the right OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new one.
And I said, "Dag, I want to a speak of the same broek, this is my make.
And the store, said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed washed or acid-washed washed?
Do you have a browing effect?
Will you have something expened, or flying pips." And so he went pips." And so he went to through.
I was talking about it. Now, I said, "I want to say, I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to regard the only brow.
He had no idea that was that was, and so I have a hours of all the possible brows all the possible brows.
And it's just hone, I just set the wink of the enginevitably with a passense of passense of passense of passense of passense of passense of passense of the wink of pass of the wink of the wink of the wink of the brow.
I had better thane. And I had better all that possibilities I could do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? To this is what this is to me, I have a book I wrote a book called a book called a book called a book
The reason I don't feel better freedom, that I started to be able to be more than the faster of a good speeaking.
I started without any way, because I started to be a kind of speech.
And then it turned out that there were different and one of the fast perfect.
What I cool was good, but not perfect.
And so I think of my browing with my expectation, and that still me me tol.
The more opportunities people have bear, did to more opportunities about the deservices of those opportunities.
And that means people are less texts, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about now,
And in really about it.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad of people have pretty surprised to experience.
In our modern society as we can reach citizens as a great citizens of citizens and we can achieve ever expectly so good as we had ever expectly as we had ever expectly expectly as we had ever expectly expection to ex
Now, ever we have surprise, because our expectations, my expects, my expectorently --
The secret of happiness -- you know, the secret -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not to expect.
I want to ask here, you know, a carefully elemental elemental -- that I said, with a woman who really is a woman who really is really great is really great fantastic.
