And I showed these two slides to show these two slides to show that the pole cap, who was the last three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this distinct is the series of this particular problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of ice.
The ice cap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crach in summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what's happening in the last 25 years.
The permanences is dived in red.
As you see, it set out of darkblue.
That's the yearal ice ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or old is almost like flower, which is from the body is flowering here.
In 25 years of this to this crazy.
And that's a problem because the frozen floating around the North Icelebrating and there is a very big amount of frozen carbon classor of carbon diother, when it deed, deed, deed, by micros.
And compared to the total amount of unreverse in the atmosphere, could double the amount of atmosphere, if we can double the corn.

And I gave an introduced an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back to come back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am own, for those who were not going to be the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment ever experiment in the entry.
It has to be the conditions need to have been able to set the billion less than a billion of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitiously, so, so, so,
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of that mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the one I work. And this is the one I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in building to the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That made a party corned in the controlle-cule.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was all the way around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and put that particles in the detector of the LHC, and picture classed in the detector of the LHC to photograph of the first particle of the LHC to photograph street around the LuC to the first of the first of the LHC went around the way around the way around the way around the way around the way around the LHC, and picture.
In other words, when we had this picture picture on 10 September we had that the machine worked the machine worked in the machine of the winning.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest page or this, or then, then, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page of it was looking at a time.
That means that we have made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden wear with these golden wear golden these golden wears.
And those wear wear ago, 13 thousand amper is thousand the machine on full force in full force the machine on full force in front of those are full currents.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too little wear. It's too little wear."
They can do that because they can do superceither are superceive temperaturs.
So in the multi-degrees of space between the stars, who can drags that are draws that are draws that are drawing stream between the stars,
In one of the connections between nine thousand magnes in the LHC, was sat a constructive.
And that was something warmed something warming, and there was something electrical resistance against 13 thousand amper results.
This was the result.
This is more impression if you realize your realizes that magnets more than 20 tons are weight, and they were about 30 centimeters.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did do.
We all have repair.
Now they are back to way.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We will set him again, and we expect measurements in June or June so we can further to figure out what the construction of the universe is the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who are unhappiness.
I think it's so difficult is so difficult, the fact that we go further than the LHC.

I would like to start asking to ask to you, to go back to your childhood when you play with blocks playing block.
When you found to discovered how to understand how to move it and consciously problems to learn by learing and learning space with and depended up with and depending space relationship to solve and ded space relationship to the depended up and learn the way to understand how to solve it and space relationsed to be able to understand the space relationships and found spaceaking, and learning space relationsick and learning to be able to do to under.
Rumultiply insight is a strong because understand the world to understand the world around us.
If an information inspired by physical interaction with physical interaction with objects -- together with my adviser Pattion and my compassion to my advising Jee Calanithi -- I started asking -- what if we were a computer mose to be able to mose of that mouse to be able to mose as a kind of digital finger-fingerences that we could move on a place of information that we could move captube able to understand flysical flysical flying floor five on a kind of information fult of information fulating information full fulation,
and orders can orders as we wane?
This question to pick us so decided that we decided to look for a answer by Siftables.
Cort say is a Sift is a Sift of an interactive computer in a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can be movement to each other, they can feel each other and contact them a screen and wireless.
The corrip is the physical trade-understanding of the blocks of cutting out of graph.
And in the enormous Siftable, a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
And so that this resources are a more physical different of their movement and they movement of their movement and even then, and even of the way we move them move, there are different new and ful interactions of fun and fun, there are different new and fun.
I will start with a few simple examples of the examples of the simple examples of a few simple examples of the simple examps.
This Sift is institude, to show a video that are playing to do a video celebrates and others played and playing other.
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And then they will be place each other, they will be interest.
If they are surrounds, they can notice this and can be able to be able to be able to smile.
Then they movement and she movement and helling.
We realized that is one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all of the interaction of the today, as it was a fluid getting a fluid of a fluid -- it was a fluence.
In this example of Sift three Siftables and I can use them to go color in a leg and I can use them to go into a leg leave color in a leg of fixed --
And if we have overleft to save back to what we have back.
There are some clear capabilities for education, mainly game play game with languages and logics and logics where people want to give people the quickly give people to try to do things quickly to see things fast.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmative.
Here we show a game that a cross-crash is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every raround a willing to every Siftable, and dreamed words are controlled in a dictionary word in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds, it is removed to be removed, and shaps a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I low them to try to make them try to make it out a video of making.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly nearly nearly instructions that people don't need instructions
Everything you have to say is "Make words" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test the test of it.
That's our youngest basically true strong, right.
And it seems that he just said the Siftable.
For him were just blocks.
Here's a interactive painting shown painting shown again.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language of develop.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the scene with that characters with that characters with that characters of the table.
Here he is going to come up with the sun here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good guess! Yeah!
And through the shakters and the next to soil the characters to each others responding to each other, Waly.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it walks away.
Video: The cattle.
DM: The last example I will show you that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument that we evolved recent a sound product that every Siftable, basss and drum.
One has four different variations, where you can choose what you can use the choose you can choose any of it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftable, so that you can determine the pattern of them to determine.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leg Sift is live controlled of effects are live controlled of reverb, and filter.
They're added to a sound and added and adapted by side.
And the almost entire along the alize of temple, and volume that are applied on the entire pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a lead.
Now, I place the basic.
Video: Now, I feed a little bit slaugh.
Video: There's a courage of the drums, so I can influence the drums, so I can influence it to influence live in the fect of the drums, so I can influence the filter of the drums, so that I can influence the effect of the drums, so that I can influence the filter to the filter of the
Video: DM: I can accelerated it by the office of the blocky.
Video: Now, I put the filter on the basas for the basas for the basas for a little more expression.
Video: DM: I can replay regular the patterns while it plays.
So I don't need to planning anything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And finally the dims of the fence of the volume Sift to the full left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new human being computer interfaces that have been tile better interfaces that are tile in the way our brain and working and working and works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design region to you some new element that we develop the developing of the ab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the touch of the resources to a very new generation of interact with digital media, which bringing the information to our world like to bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much of heart.
I look at it to you all with you.
I'm writing write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My entire life for long I have to do for the writing of writing and I don't think that will change it.
And yet there is something own in my life and owners, in my life and career, and I had to see my relationship my work again.
It started with a book that I did written uns a memoire, "Eten, Biddle, Biddy, that is very opposed to my first work and was very opposed to my first world and an international considered to my first world and an international constantly was international constitution to my first world and a field.
The consequence is that people are now all over the whole I came aged me and always drawing all over the time.
Do you get what -- does!
People come to me and ask me ask to me and ask you to me and ask you will never be successful?
Don't you concerned your entire life writing your entire life writing to publish you, write where people will write for warm to write where people will write you?
Don't you see that?"
And very single reasoning, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I want to remember 20 years ago -- I was when I told a teenager, when I told I wanted to be write I write write.
People said, "Don't you have never frightening that you'll never get success?
Don't you know, you don't conception to it.
Don't you can not afraid you live to this work without of this work without and you will die, and you will die in the mouth of your broken droms on your broken drown fail?"
Something in that distrike.
And in the short comes to this question to this questions to this questions -- "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that are called
Always the real.
But I also much other things that are bang, you don't want to know that all of the things that all of the things that all of the time.
For instance, for instance, and other engineering things.
But what is write write I ask myself the last time that are feeding fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically a context to be afraid to the work for the work for the work for their opinion of earth are making on the Earth are they put in the fact that somebody is doing to their opin?
What is so particularly creative processes that we make us to make the effects of it the effects of it was supposed to be able to do the effects of work happens.
Take my father. He was chific engineer, and I can't remember that there was no one in 40 years that he was asked to him any of him or he didn't have any for the fright.
And that's what you're saying, "You're how to your chemistry blocks?"
No, it didn't work about it.
And to be fair fair engineers have engineers by the eterns have been didn't have the reputation of manicious to be piece.
And so, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writing, also other creative people have subject human beings are instability to be instability to be instability.
Look at the griming deaths the most magnificent creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died, often young, often by own own own own through own own own through own own own own own through own own own own through own own own own own own own to be doing through own own own own own acts.
And even those who don't have suicide no suicide of the suicide of their gave under their gave leave.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Well, each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit about your life work.
But of this kind of excerced out of this kind of except --
We all heard it before and we've all heard it all before.
The concerned thought is that creativity is involved to be connected to suffering suffering is going to lead to ellere.
So I want to ask everybody here today: You can you with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it is a well, I think about it is not the pretty thought I don't think about pretty pretty though.
I find it representation.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century is that this century.
We can sports a lot better to live.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to that dark concerned to be dangerous.
And the phases that my careers now in my careers now now.
You're just took up, I'm young, amper safty a year.
I can may be four decades through decades.
And so, the same thing that I will have publicly seen publice the outside world as the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up with friends up to you, so I can slap you know, my biggest success of behind me.
Yem, what a sense.
And if you think about this, you know, you can think about the morning to the morning to the neine hours to the drink.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me work where I love with the work I love.
The question is, "How ?"
After long after a long time I can do the conclusion I can do with write I can write a psychological protection in the process of in.
I have to write during a safe distance between myself between myself and my overwhich, and my overwhich, and my conceptions of reactions in my future publications.
I have looked at the last year, to ways to ways to ways do that.
I have been down in history and have dissed, and have disses in other societies have found a better way to see some better way to help creative people to get to the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romein's didn't believe that creativity was coming from henable.
And people believe that creativity was a faul, who was a faul, unknowledle, unknowledless the humans to the humans to the reasons.
The Greeks called these concerned spirit of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon who had a demon that he had a demic words in flu.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And in the called them called a geniused to be a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius,
In their production was a geniused to be a kind of magic dives in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artists was working a work of assistance,
He was working form shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about before, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work was going to be work.
The artists was protection to protection against for example, to example,
If you brilliant was brilliant there, you can't get all the every fairly ever ever ever to it.
Everybody knew that a mean, that a few genius, you know,
Word you work on crowd that not only you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time is that the considered how in the West creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change the Renaissance, and changed it.
There's a very new idea: the individual human is the resources of the universe and the resources of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, sent from the dives from the dive.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity came from the individual production.
And for the first time in history was talking about artists artists were said that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say honestly that I have a big front of a faile.
And in one person, one person, one person, one individual individual is the fiel, the essential, the essential, the source of the century of everystery, of everything is good to be familiar family of family human psyche.
Anybody asks somebody asking.
Egos are blown to a huge proportion, and there are universed incredible higantial experiences to exprestations to express experiences.
And I think this pressure, the last 500 years of artists are capated in the last 500 years of artists artists are made a lot of artists artists capot.
If that is, and I think, and I think is the question -- "What now?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back older the older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the parentship of the relationship between the relation
Maybe not.
Well light in a 18 years of humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably in the audience people who have reversed scientific basically double double creatures about the idea that elfully creatures the work of artists to inspiring artists the work of artists of artists to inspiring high-texts.
It doesn't seem me that I will get you to get to you.
I won't ask me it.
Why not?
Why should we have this thought to do that concerned to do that concerned to do that?
It's just as much wrong as much wrong as all the other explanations of the total uncompany incomputational process.
Everybody who have a little bit of a little bit of anything -- so in fact, all the presents -- you know that the creative process is not always rational process is not always ration.
That sometimes almost paranoral.
I have recently recently to the amazing American closer Ruth Stone of the result.
She's in the nined. Her whole life although they close poetry.
She told me about her childher right on Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field of work, she heard a poem about the country.
And it was so saying, as if there was a big wave air, as if there was a big wave air.
And the poem wave than the country to its the country to its her.
And she felt that the ground, she was started shaking her feet, and knew that her at that time, but to do is to shake one thing to her life: running for her life.
And she running home, followed by the poem and she had to see the poem and paper and paper and paper to showing and paper and paper and paper and package.
When the poem through her her came her was waves her enly to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then run, but run, it's not the house is running and running and run.
And at the moments shot poem close of her it, disappears -- in her words -- in the words -- in the words -- to another poets -- to another poetry.
And there were also one -- I think about this -- I think the most beautiful part of the story -- they were the poem -- they almost miste.
And then she was looking for the home and paper and pies, and the poem through its its it.
And Juist on that moment she had a pencil of pencil suit.
And with her other hand, so told me she poeded the poem from the air.
And she picked up the poem of his tail, and it back again, and it again, as she written the write.
In that cases came the poem close of piece of piece, but then in the close of paper --
When I heard that -- I thought -- which happens to be able to clean, my creative process!
This is how my creative process is not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, who every day on the same time, which every day and sweating it and sweating it and trans it sweat.
But even in that day is swrong I had such a experience.
You can also know it myself, that feeling that there are creative ideas in your brearels from a source that you can identify impossible you can identify it to be able to identify it might be able to do itself.
What is that for sources?
How can we use it without we can be crazy?
And in a way that is good for us?
The best contemporain example that I can think I can think I can think I can think I think is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the around this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life had been shown the showed of the amazing artists that are trying to get to the uncontinue to the uncontinue to the uncontinue creative impulse that are indive.
And the years, the years was Tom a little bit of smess.
And one day he reflect in Los Angeles over the fast, and changed it really, and changed it radical.
And as he was driving this fragmental of a melodie.
The decided that faile, like inspiration that faile, understand the available, understand
It was a nice nice and he wanted to hold it the hold.
But that went doesn't have that.
He had no paper -- no paper -- no pies, no tarp, no tarp,
The amazing exciting exciting exciting excited the melody is leaking the melody and then it turns me the melody remains me behind me eught back to me to the real frame.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, to the sky and said, "Sorry heard you can't see that I behind the sky stuff that I behind the same down,
"Do you really think I can write a song of a song you can write a song of the song of you can write a song of you can write a song of the song of you can write a song of the song of the song
And if you really want to get that song you have to get to be again, you have to have to class for you.
Not that is not, well, you don't have a different fall.
Go neighborhood." And from Leonard Cohently from the process of the process of very different.
The work is the same thing is the same thing that is the same dark of the same dark of the same dark of the same dark of the same dark of the same dark is the same dark of source.
But the heavy of the engineering that creative process in him called the engineering of genius.
The geniused to close the skin and liver skin, and like, just the skin and like.
And to realized that there was no reason to go through through this.
It could be a wonderful cooperation between a wonderful conversation between Tom and the own aspect that wasn't quite at all.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a profession of that.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biinn, Biinn.
And at a certain point I am in despersing in despere.
You know that you don't want to be good to be good to be a terrible disaster and you think it's a terrible disast.
Not just soil, really horrible ad.
I wanted to take the entire project all the project of the project of the entire project.
And then I remember Tom that comes to his genius, and I decided to be a possible attempt to a possible of that currents.
I wished me from my manuscrips and focus to a focus to a focus to a funding the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all this, we know all this, if this book is not brilliant is that book, it's not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the lesson I have in me.
I can't give you a lot of that.
And if you find that it should be better than you can get your thing to do you.
Do you don't have that? Do you don't know that, under that.
I just write do, because that's a medium my work.
Oh, and in the notults are going to be him to be a difference that is just on the office are different."
Tja--- United comes on down here,
Euth, early came to the North African desert people to danance any courage people to dance in the sacres of music.
And then hours and hours hours and to the morning glor.
That was always amazing, because the dancers were fulnessionals.
But sometimes, very single thing happened to be something subject happened.
One of those dancers were transcendent.
You know what I mean to do mean with that, you also have seen you can also have seen a perform in a perform of a perform
It was like the time silenced and dance the dances through a porn.
He didn't have anything else than the thousands of nights, but now everything together.
And suddenly seemed to be a human being.
In him, under him, above him -- above him --
A womb fire, through fire.
And if something like this, you know, people had happened to be Dan people had started to clap and calling them to call, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical fact you: When the Moren Span, the Mors Span, they broke this wonest.
The quote is really changed by the centuries, is changed by the centuries, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oh one."
That hhear you today the day in died, and flamengodances and flamengodance.
If a piece of an artist, or magically does to do something impossible is to say, "Allah, Allah, oh other, broroa."
Right? Right? See, a glimpse of God.
Prified what we need.
And suggested is that the dancing the next morning at the morning at the morning at the morning at the morning at 11 a.m.
And at that moment is he again, a little older man with depently, that might never will come to such a such high high high high high of cular high high high of course is going to come again.
Maybe never going to never anybody God to calls dance.
What to do you have to the rest of his life?
That's hard to that.
That's really difficult to square to sing a creative mind.
But so painful is not need to be not to be that.
Imagine you don't have excited that the most unusual aspects of your person are coming from yourself.
And imagine you believe them a while, you know, she was a little bit of a doesn't take a specificate of a source.
When you ready around them, they are spending to somebody else.
That's how everything is considered to be thing.
I hang the inside of the thought of the thought.
The last months I have worked on a book that inside is going to be apart in a lot of reach reach to is chairing out of the long months of the last months of the last months that will be appeared to be apart.
The follower of that illuster precedence.
And if my thought to me the same thing to me and I went up the same thing that is not fright.
So just a work.
You just put your thing, what's also what it is.
If you task you is too dance, you know, dance.
And if the dival geniused to decide to decide in your work at your work at eny moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful source, "Ole.
There's not, thance then, but thane of thane --
And then says, "Ole.
I believe that heart.
"Olens," anyway, because we pure human love and ownersness of human love and still plup.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I have had a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can meaning, and then it can mean and discovered from genes.
We start from a new point of point: we were the digital code of digitizing and now we were trying to go from that digital code to a new phase of the fase in biology to design and synthising synthetic life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And what I think is something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand on different levels of level in different level.
We tried different approaches tried to minimum components.
We're now going to be digitizing it digitize the digitize of digitization.
When we have sequence, when we have sequence, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, do we try to ask is to try to regenerate new life, or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of a that can be multiply full in a laboratory of a laboratory --
And we tried to look at if we can get to a non-smaller genome.
We can have in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively compared to the metabolical compared to the metabolical compared to the metabolical map,
Beleve, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at per piece of piece is very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell that this would be a living cell cell to be educated.
We decided that the only route condition to synthetic this chromosome of the most function so we could descents the components to synthetic questions.
And so we started with questions like questions like a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthe
So the chemistry the chemistry of this very big molecules that we never see?
And, if we can do that, can be a chromosome clear "start?
A chromosome is by the way, but a piece of chemical inerts material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing life is accement on exponential way.
Our capability to write the genetic code, but it's a rather slowly slowly and addream in.
And our last point would be places at this exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethical tack prediction to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult to be very difficult.
There's tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it make piece of makes are more wrong.
So we had to add a new method to the containing these little pieces of these little pieces and corrigating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt of attempt Phi X, the digital information of the genome Phi X.
That's a little virus virus that kill kill.
We designed the pieces, did the wrong, the wrong correction ...
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the course started to piece a piece of chemical stops, and the bacteria cumulti-code genetic code and makes viral particles making.
The viral particles were leaving the cells, they were showed out of the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model just said that model, but all of the fairly clean.
They laughing more than you.
So we think this is a situation where we think this is a situation in which the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to be much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome full bacterial chromosome full chromosome full chromosome full chromosome full chromosome full chromosome full chromosome full bacterial chromosome full bacterial chromosome f
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could vary the cassettes --
to understand what the act is actually understanding components of a living cell cell
The design is critical information and if you start with digital information in computer than that are digital information very accurate.
When we first first curved this genome in 1995, the standard of the standard precision is one wrong 10,000 basepars.
And then we found the resequencing of 30 mistakes 30 mistakes. And if we had the original sequence was not to start to start.
And the design is the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other students of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build a sub-units that we have to design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can be able to design a flass that we have to design a field su
We design here unique unique unique unique unique unique of designing here.
Maybe you read to stop water mers in stopped water mers in stop.
There's thinking about this: We have a squarter genetic code: A, C, Gene-T.
Trios of those letters code for roughout 20 aminose -- that there is a result attention to each amino.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write, smooth.
And then we only cigate signed a mess.
Some of them were teletaking core that there were no poems that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyming.
There are enzymes they repay and they put them into each other.
And we started to make pieces of them five to 7,000 letters five to 7,000 letters were long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, take it from 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
And in each stages we could have a confluence of these pieces so we could sequence them to sequence a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- you will see that strakes sequences of sequences to sequence a slide, we could sequence them sequence to sequence them
We try to accomplain the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbalaxies.
And once we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 bases -- more than 100,000 bases -- they don't grow so easily more in E.
That resources of all the modern tools of modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homology recombination, which is used by the biology to repairs of DNA and repairs can feed DNA and that can feed a little bit together can feed feet.
Here's an example of that.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million radiotic radiation to radiation on radiation to radiod race.
You can see that in the upper panel, she just really, she just really, she just takes from each other.
12 hours later 24 hours later it was in each other, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dried around the full
They can live in a vacuum live.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can be moved to be able to find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has shows shows that there is a lot of of this, there.
Here's a referred reflecule that we made the molecule that we made these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with the right design of the course design of the pieces that we were in the right design of the pieces that we were in the right design of the molecule,
Gist makes them automatically add automatically add automatic.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule, that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about six seconds.
This is the publication we includes that we include.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule, by people, with a obvious structure.
The molecule, is more than 300 million together.
If we should press the pressure, with a 10-points letter, without spations, then there's 142 pages only to presses the genetic code.
All right, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the things that are we start?
And a virus is clearly clear.
And a bacteria is much more complicated --
It's also simple, if you like, you just put under the footage of the cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell clone.
And the bacterial species is the chromosome of the chromosome of the cell in the cell transplant that we show we can do a full transplant to a full transplant to ansplant a chromosome of the cell to another, and can activate the cell of a chromosome of the cell transportation of a chromosome of the cel
We have a chromosome of supply of a microbbenspecies.
These are about as far as far as far as people and mice as people and mice.
We add some extra gene so that we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the extra gently extra general extra gently extra gentle.
We have a reflect with enzymes to make all the proteints.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will put the very advanced graphics -- the very advanced images -- the new chromosome of the cel.
We even thought he would come to be just to develop the process of developing a process of developing a process of developing that process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of the chromosome of third somewhere in third thousands of properties in one time, they add property thousands of property of property have been add property to the species.
People who are evolution to evolution equipments, and equally changing a lot of biology commitment.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzymes that are actually found DNA
The chromosome that was not ever even't either.
The cell chromosome that we stop in it, well, we stop it.
It was expresses expressed, and the recognize of the other chromosome of the strange of material, and then we finally had the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell of the other chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the new chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop in it.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the one species of the one species and changed completely in the new species, and changed on the new software that we had stopped in the cell of the new spect.
All of proteins changed the membrans changed -- when we had the genetic code of the same defence in which it was changed.
This is a may sound like genomical alchemistry, but we're in the software DNA, to change things that software DNA, to change things fundamentally change things
All right, I have paid earlier that this is not a creation -- this is a break -- this is a constantly five billion years evolution, and I have pay that we may have a new version of the Cambric explosion of the Cambric explosion of the Cambring new species of the Cambring in the digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what's need.
We're going to be shortly from six-half to 9 billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context placemen: I born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us that in 1946; within 46; within 460 years.
We have a food, with food, with food, with food, fuel water, drugs for the six-andst-and-half billion.
That's going to be a difficult to do that.
We use five billion ton colup, more than 30 billion fats oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we have biological processes in the eys-shether or anything about being than any process to replace.
And then of course, of course, there is all the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is a chill dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is of that carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of that carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the carbon di
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see the design components for the future.
The electronics industry industry and a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of that.
We are mainly limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have technique fast synthesize synthesimages to do so-called combination genomics."
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
And if you think about the 20 million different genes of genes or trying to optimize octan, to optimize octan, we can produce octan, we can change a little vaccines, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design design developing software where we work on the computer, and you can really go to the computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code
We focus on fourth generation four fuel generations.
Right? Rethanol you see, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation second fuel of fuel that will come from coming from sugar, like sugar, to more fuel fuel fuel fuel of fuel as sugar, or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology without the food price without the food price and the availability to reduce the food price is when we start with CO2 as his food supply to design the way that we can do it in that way, and we think we think we are the first foods ful fuel of fun generation within about 18 months of fun food.
Slight and CO2 is method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of different methods.
This is an organism that we described described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea -- about 2.5 miles deep did, at sales in the smperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at if we can take CO2 we can be able to take CO2 is to be able to be able to factory to factory to factory that is cleaning to fuel thing, to send this process.
So in a short time we think that we are able to continue that we are able to break on the basic question to the basic question question: What's life?"
We have really, you know -- you know, the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where you can't do this?
A important energy source becomes
But we also now working on these tools to think of these tools to think quickly series of vaccines to think quickly are series of vaccines to think about fast vaccines are also using these fast series of vaccines to the fast series of vaccines to the fast of these tools to use these tools to be fast fast fast vaccines to the fast series of vaccines.
This year was the flu -- we always just behind the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change from being combined vaccines.
And you see how the future can go out of the future can go out of the future tree is going to change the synthetic bacteria of evolution of synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually eventually evolution to the end, eventually edge.
We're already frising people.
Our goal is to ask is to ask that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that may be doing that may be doing that may be able to do that makes you may be.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to a consider to Microsoft brosoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can local or with immense amounts of visual data can work of visual data can work on the distance.
We look at this many gigabyts, and we can continue in digital images and can be seardless in the wish of the wish, and the sort of terms and the sort of wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how large these collections or images are images or images are images or images are looking at how much of information we look at how much these collections or images are look at how much information or images are images of information that we have a look at how mu
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapix.
It all doesn't matter nothing because the only thing that because the only thing would influence affect on a such of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graude by Dickens. Every column. Every column.
And to prove that it's really text text text is really to do something that is really to do something that is really text to show something that is really text ax; this is not a picture -- this is not a picture of imagination.
Maybe this is a slight way to read a book way to read a book.
I wouldn't resse.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a part of the part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real papers magazine, which is actually a scales a scaling medium.
We also did something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a favaile of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information information information -- and we have extra lot of information -- and we have extra bit of advertising information -- and we have extra fright.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the limitations of accounts, in the directors of accounts.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups means and other flaure.
Of course of country to put a hand apply application for a technology like this, I won't spend time to this field -- except that we can contribute this field also much of this field ield --
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And place above on the picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something different.
This is a by the way, by the way, you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seitz Seitz and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision of Washington, promoso on the University of Washington, led by Steve Seitz on University at U.Washington,
and Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution resolution to it.
The space of the images of the images is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies in the Canadian Rockies -- where they genomes are genomes of diashws or panorama and panorama and panorama panorama and panorama and panorama and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there's time to show or there's a little environment.
There are much more space that are more space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth synth of Photosynth -- to the communicate of the communicating of this technique of this technique, to look at the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to have to have to have the advoces and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Day, with imagine flickr. You search Day in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so much of the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so the campus and so much of the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus
And each of these orange chains gives a imagination that is part of this model.
And so all of Flickr images, that are all of Flickr in this way.
And we can navigate points.
You know, I had never thought I would have thought I would ever work at Microsoft of Microsoft --
It's overwhelming here is so deeply to be so deeply to be so deeply to be so deeply to be deeply to be so deeply to be reading here.
I believe you can see that these are types of cameras are cameras everything from mirror reflex, a big number of them, which is a big number of them,
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much covered by faces, and so much of the faces and such it.
Anywhere between is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
And this is even a poster of the Notre Day, also good Dalso goodged by the program.
If we dive through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really can do is to do things with the social environment. This is the data of everybody -- of the entire collective memory of how to do -- and the Earth -- and heading it all about each other.
All these pictures are inition, and form a very much bigger than the parts.
You've got a model that from all around the Earth corn.
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work in the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use and the benefits are growing for the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being supposed to metaph-data somebody else data to be a different inputs.
If somebody would like to click and their names and their names and their names and my names of the Notre Day, my photographs, and I can use it as a access to the space, which is metaph, using anyone of these space, using anyone of the photographs, and create a kind of cros-modeal, and create social social social social social social social social social social social social social of these of these of these of these of these of these of these of these of these of course, and they are of course, and
And of course, the meaning product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just pictures, satellite images and other pately other pictures is directly from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are deviolence to everyone in the world can be able to copped by everyone in the world to be able to get to the world software to the world in the next years?
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
The creates to your wish rent, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that in the imagine in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the rich-doing when you think about the richdom of semantic information that are about a lot of these images.
When you look for the web sheearly to image, you can figure out and the text on the web page of the pictures of what the image of the imagina lot of information about what the imagina of information about what the image.
What now if now that is couple of your imaginations?
And then the number of semany semantic connections and the amount of running that comes from that, you know, it's a classic. It's a classical networkfect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. It's really incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and research is the possibility to live between them who are not forgotten to be forgetting their past, who are not forgotten to the reason their pasts in the wind, the profess, the profession bitters of the production in resources of the intentional researching in the wind of the intense flass of eating researching the old of the old wintense of the old of the any of the any of the old coming research,
The science that Jaguar-shamans still travels to the Milky Way Wael, or the myths of In, or the myths of In, or that in Himalaya bood-booking, or remember still on the breath of Dharma, remember remember to remember the world of anthropology is not to absolute sense, but it's just one model of the world is not a model of the world of the world is not engame, but it's just one model, but it's a model,
the consequence of a fairly accidental choices that makes our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same require require require require: Worn kids in the world.
We all make indedicated in.
And so, because the inconnection is through the death.
So it can't be surprise that we sing; dances and art them, dances and art them.
But interesting is the unique cadancadancadance, and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is that to the Pene in the wouldn't have the Penisolies, or the Voo-bolia or the Voo-Kaisut-desert desert in North Kenya, the Caravances in the Andes Bornext or the Caravantage in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- this is the man with the deal, a monthy -- or now a months of Qomolangma,

They all learn us that we can think we can be able to think different, our different, our others can be able to orient to orient from the Earth of them are learning.
And if you think about it, you can only give you a lot of this, you can only give you a lot of it.
And then the intelable cultures in the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet is as important and cultural life-web is as important life.
This cultural lifesweb you can imagine a sfair.
The core fact you can defining the function of all thoughts, dreams, mythes, mythes, mythes, ideas, mythes, ideas, and intuitions that are constantly by the human imagination of our consciousness.
The corporation face is the big nalatence of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and we can be able to be amazing curious species.
Like the biosphere is so-focus is the eath sphere is that we have been -- and in much larger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist would be at least half of all species in the point of extinction is not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is loss of language.
And then you have born born born of the was, were trying to speak on Earth speaking on Earth --
A language is more than the words, or her grammatic rules.
A language is a language of the human soul.
It's the vehicle, the sick of every unique culture the material world is reaching material world to reach culture the material world is reaching the sical world.
Every language is an eternal mind a disteswrong, a though, an ecosystem to spiritual possibilities.
And from that sixed thousand languages today is not fluisted in children's fluists fluists are fluisted in children's fluist.
They're no longer babies no longer to be learned babies no longer to be longer babies no longer to be longer babies no longer learned no longer to learn.
Effective means that, unless another change, that they are already death, that they are dead.
Is there something like to be a single reflect by stilent, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to have a chance the wisdom of ancestors by giving the kids of the children to see the children to see the children teaching of the children's children?
Prifice that is someone's someonmous state every two weeks in somewhere in every two weeks in every two weeks aways, every two weeks of an old language.
Some of you say, "Wouldn't be better if we all should speak if we all the same language of the same language of you? I say, let's take Kantone." Or Kantonee.
Or Kogi," you will realize you realize how it would not be able to speak your own language to speak to you.
So what I want to do today is to take you on a short journey by the eating nosfir, who has to be lost sketches of what is lost in fact,
Many of us forgotten that when I talk about a different way of being a different way of being really mean.
For instance, this Barasana child in the North west Amazon, the people, the people believe the anaconda, that believe the crace of the east, in the belly criver, in the belly of sness.
This is a full cognitive the colors blue and not distinction because it wonderful, because it wonderfully to the sky of the equivalent of the equal dependent.
They have a falling language-marriage-slegal regular exogamy is called somebody who are called somebody who are speaking a different language of these.
This has become in mythological past, but the extraordinary full full in their houses, where six or seven languages are trying to fire, but you never never heard a language of talking about seven talking about seven talking to you.
They simply simply and start speaking and then start speaking and then start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and then start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking and start speaking to be simply

These minds are important during their Hamatsa-indeeply in their Hamatsa-indeed.
And if you start to the idea that these cultures are different realities, you start to get a courage of their extraordinary extraordinary discoveries. And you can take this plant.
It's a picture I jump. I mean, in the North west Amazone nam.
This is ayaahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaahuman ca is so fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it, but how it is. It's built up. It's built up.
And the side of the side of the better carboline, harmaline and harmaline in itself-hallucinating works.
And if you just take the plant of the plant of the skwalm through your skwalm through your consciousness smoke.
The plant is mixed with leaves from a coffee of a coffee beh, Psychotridis.
The plant powerful tryptamines, narry tryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.
Do you have seen the Yanomami if they are seen that snow substance, that substance of different species that are methoxyltryltryltryptamine and fai?
That pooder your nose is shot in a being society, is shot with barokay, to country to country to country to country to form the reality; it creates a distribution of reality; it creates the reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convincing the psychedelic era -- a man who discovered the psychedic ages in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I pay that these tryptamines didn't identify were hallucinated because when it's effect his involved because when it's effect his intract to experience. Tryptribute the hallucination. Tryptamines are not oral oral orgunning enzym in the human darmouth in the human darmouth of oxida.
They can only be oral oral to be encourage with something that the monoamin of you don't don't feel anything that the monoamin of the samine.
The fascinating is that the bettable carbolines in the lide of the benoff-cupt-suppressiers to activators to activator, you can have the question of the question of two morphological species are two morphological experiences are two morfical experienced species a biochemical flash to the bigger than the shapes that are bigger than the same than the same way of the parts of the parts of the parts of the cornments?
We say euphistic "trial trial and ror, which is becoming deficiles.

Now, the problem is that even those are the sympathy under us that sympathy contemic follow them as curious and colorrich are seeing to a foot-never seeing the foot-nect world, meaning our world, meaningful the history of the world, dealthrough the history of our world, dealing our world means are the sympathy of us and color.
The truth is that 20th century is not rememed to be remembered to be the wars or technological innovations, but earlier as the era in which we were stood at the mass of the mass of biological and cultural diversity and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always to a dance with new life-possibilities.
And technology is also the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux indians didn't stop their pile, when Americans are stopping their pile, when Americans Americans when they gave their purples and wearing their purps and carries.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eater threats are threat.
The wral face of the government of the government.
Where you can also look at the world, you will notice that it's not the flock of these cultures and to disappear.
These are dynamic living people, whose existences by identificide being drivable forces that are being powerful forces that are being possibilities.

The pain of Tibet is not to contain, until you get on the basic level level level level.
I have a young colleague about a young colleague in West Chength in West China to Lhasa.
And when I was showed in Lhasa -- I understood the faces that you heard the statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroy monuments in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchs Lama.
And based from that he was killed directly when the Chinvase invase in the Chinvase invase in the Chinvase invased in the fasy invased when the Chinese invased invased in the Chinese invase was killed to the Chinese invase invase of that, he was killed to death.

And one day they got a day per unhappiness on a Mao. For this country she had showed up for seven years of she had showed up in a slide.
The pain of Tibet can be unbasically be unbasically be intly, but the completely is something to clamp.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Do we have to a gray world of such life or want to live a colorrrich world of diversity in diversity understanding of diversity --
The big anthropology Margaret Mead said that she was fear that she direction that we direction is a general means that we didn't have a general faile,
We wouldn't just see the human imagination are being model, model, and we would have agree close and forget forward and forget forgets to forget and forged that there are other options of options that there are other options of the options are also field.
We can feel us courage our concerned about the idea that our species are about 15,00000000s."
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave us agriculture, where we gave us overgave to the cull of the shaman shows the shaman was replaced by the proza of the priests of the priests of the priests of the specialization of the priests of the specialization of the seeing of the show.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history doesn't give me the idea that we don't have me the idea that we have all the answers to all the question of the question of our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to humans are asked to humans are asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song, we will discover again to be discover to be the possibility to be able to be able to follow all the gary of the gary of the gary of the garbits of gary gary rative.
I have this picture on the northern point of Baffin Island taken when I went to Intervent on the narrow.
This guy, Olayer, Olayum, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Ince. In the 1950s were being place. In the 1950s are indications in the corn.
The opa of Olayuk reflect.
The family peaced, the family of his life and he was already him for his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Infrom not afraid the Infrom the coll; they made it use.
The gline iod-icro-images were originally made from fish in charibooks.
Olayum was not afraid to the polar night or the storm that was race.
He went outside of the skin, skined skin his hands and skin his hand. And when the poo, the poo, he was shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a layers a low speak to the side of the mess.
When it solid was slaughing up a dog.
He did dogs and improvised a hearnas.
And from the ribbreast, he made a sle.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice foops incluts,
Over so, nothing around with nothing around the world, in many way, many symbol for the weather of the Indistance and the indigenous people.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government from the entire country from a country and Texas a piece of country and Texas Tas together and Texas the California and Texas home.
It's independenly remote area. They are all the results.
It's a amazing example of how a nation of how a nation of the nation of her people can off.
And finally, I think it's obviously obviously at these home to these uptimes, least for who is not far away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are concerned of the human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, as that are about the unction of the indicate, part of a lot of hope.
What we finally do to National Geographic, is express the idea that politicians never reaching something that politicians never reaching something to be again.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories can change the world, but we believe that stories can change the world, which we probably the best of the world, we probably the best of the world, we are in 156 countries on tV a million public, we are in 156 countries on a million-public.
We make a lot of traveling to the eath front of the corn, with our public cultural places, to the real cultural places, where the concerned by what he sees hopefully the most important opening opening of the anthropology will go to live in various of the anthropology that we can find a way to live to live in a multure plure of life and plure plure to live pluralistic world.
where all the wisdom of all the followness of all the wisdom of all the wisdom of all the wisdom of the wisdom of all the wisdom of wisdom to be saw to us.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question I also until I recently to have a book of question.
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain some of the bangle that you may have misten.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precisely -- official dogma of all the Western seedly, industrialized society.
And that official dogma like this: To sowns is the fart-dispers of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level of freedom.
Freedom is a great good called a great part of the human existence.
And then freedom is able to accutting us to accump into own insight, to access a higher prosperating without of third-without of thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wheels wirel.
This is so deeply rooted in our society would take a doubt of doubt that nobody would be doubt to doubt of our society.
And in our lives is a dogma field.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. It's a mediuous.
And to talk about three of three of three of three sings.
And in that 175 can-en-co-s-fiely dressings are in my supermarket, extra-virgin my supermarkets, and different balance.
And that can make any number of dressings make a dressings for the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics -- you can say your stereoset of stroneoset of crime, cassetespecially -- cassettespul, cassetespecially started.
And in those electronics win, you can choose out of this case of language.
You can be able to say six-half million different systems with parts of the story of that store.
Give to -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could all be a telephone services but only at Ma Bell.
Your handled it to be able to do it.
That had the consider considered that it never before it was never before.
That time is pretty time.
And now there are a lot of different state.
And especially with cell phones is the diversity.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the medium -- that with mid-favorite player, notor, right?
Well has not seen this model in the store, but you can have a sure that that happens soil, but you can have a sure that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the society of stuff is this explosive increase a fact of choices is a fact of choices is a fact of choice in aspects of choices are much more important than the point of stuff that are more important than the possible of stuff that are more important than the points of the stuff, is that more important than the point of the stuff that are more important than the point of the real,
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not that you go to the doctor, and you can tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do that, we can do that, or we can do that.
A has this form and crazy of this form and capture.
And the other thing is and this form and downing this form and doing?"
And you say, "Dr, what does find you?"
And the doctors says, "Age, this form and the device and the decise and the device and the decise of this form and then the dedicate, and the dependle, and the doctor, and the doctor, and the decisions, and the doctor, "A has this form says, "A has this form says, "A has this form saying, and the doctor, "Agetter says, and the doctors says, "A has this partice and the doctor, and the doctor, and the doctor, and the doctordity, and the doctornavire is to says, and
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And we call that "own inbringing the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means the heavy task of decision of decision of things -- the doctors -- the doctor, somebody who are certainly certainly sick sick sick of the instances -- the patient to take the best of recipating resources are captures are silled recive shifts.
Good considered that ners, because the purpose group, you can't buy and I can't buy them.
Why make advertising they can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other brank drugs medicine.
Our identity, yet a defence aspect of us existence, is now overcommitting to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is solutely of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every single morning to the opening you have to be thinking what you want to be to be person you want to be thinking for person you want to be thinking for person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, it's family.
There's a time that free everybody is a fast, anybody you can possible by the way, and then possible of children start.
The only real choice was with whether and what you can did and what you were didn't when you did did the whole you did did.
Now, you have a free all of the opening opportunity.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I spent less homework less house than asking early less house than us.
They're not dom, or let me be in the early time.
No, they have made it with choices.
"Well, I married or not? Well, I now?
Or I will wait? Or I first want to kids, or a career?"
These are all funing questions.
They go through to them, they have a answer to them, also they don't get all their homework and therefore not to get good corners.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just gave that technology is to take us every minute, to work every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph of Hotel.
There's a by the way, one place, which I love, where WiFi it does.
I don't reason I don't want to keep that place for member.
But anything that is increasing huge choice in that we won't work on the questions, time time we go whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwidsting of our son one son the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blacberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the other side, and we may our laptop of the society.
And even if they all stand all of them are from all of the concerned with all of the conceptive of all kinds of questions, "Well, I responsible responssible question?
Will I write on this emailty respons?
And even if the answer is "Ne" is now, we experience the footbalway.
Where we have looking at the small, the little materialist bags, lifestyle, lifestyle, life is a question of choos;
And so the world used to be looking like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choice.
And so, the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of now?
The answer is: Yes."
We all know what is good about is good to be good about what is is bad about what is bad about is bad about what is bad to is.
That huge choice has two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects on human.
And a very opposed effect is that it before is before than completely free.
And with so many choices are finding the choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investments in voluntary free of investments in voluntarges.
A colleague of me got access to invest data of me concerned data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about 2,000 copy works, spread cleaning about 2,000 feeds.
And they discovered that for every 10 policy funds that work the work beated the soil two percent decision two percent decision.
In fifth fifth-percent cords did 10 percent employees are fundred to work with five fundress.
Because it in fifth-fifths is so difficult to choose the choice to the next day, and that are the next day, and that was the next day, and so forth.
And from outside comes from the object.
That means not only that those people after their pensionate to eat their pensional because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money understand that the choice was so difficult to have left the work of history.
And that lets were going to leave 5,000 dollars a year, at the nose being going to go on their nose being going to be in the neus.
The worker was namely to double.
So the too much choice can work too much choice.
And I think the world through this is so looking at the time.
If it goes to make the century, you want to make the right choice makes the right choice?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did the result of us and choose the paralyzing of our dishes and choose less teving.
There's made reasons for the reasons for that.
And one of them is that there is a choice, for instance, for instance, for instance, the choice didn't perfect perfect.
You can imagine in such a case, for that another choice would have been better --
This gets dreamed alternative to be that you get spend of your choice to choice.
And does fires the endling of the choice that you made the enormous that you made a good choice.
The more options are more options of the reason is to have a speak of uncovering the elemental elements of the gech.
Second reason has to do substitutive.
And then Gilbert gave from morning to how often we depended the value of things that we are comparing.
If you can think of many alternatives to invite, you can already the attractives of all alternatives that you dedicate.
That makes you less tevace that you have chose to the alternative that you chose are chose to you.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of the example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second of a living.
They are beautiful beautiful beach. No human beautiful.
Don't you might do it? "To choose gust, "It's aughtly augent.
Everybody in my neighborhood is the city out.
I could park my car fields can parkers."
And he is sitting there two weeks, with the idea that he was going to be a great parking again, every day parking a great parking place.
Substitutic cost of the entire chost of the enough that we have our choice makes of our choice makes making a great choice.
The more possibilities, the more attractives alternatives are there.
And those presents are presenting to us as substitutive.
Another example.
This picture is touching a number of points.
Life in the here and now for instance, and that you don't have to hate things about that.
And another point is that you have excited every choices.
And all of the other has been so resultires that the chose is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this thing, my searching searching to a new brow.
I always get speaking to always break brow.
Because of the basically break broed, and that bought your bough. It was bought to be incredibly unbelieve, but if you were the brown of the brown of the brown cross, but if you were doing the wrong OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "There's my makes broke a speek, this is my makes brok."
And the real said, "Will you fit fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to fit relaxed to fit?
Do you know if a rhyth? What are you rhyth?
Do you want a break with slum-effect?
Will you something extinctive pipes, or flulgs pipe of pipe of pipe of pipe of pipe of pipipe." And so he was just going to be extincludes to be extints.
I was spoke of speaking of a while, I want to say, "I want to say, I want the only who used to be the only who used to be the only who used to be the only who was going to be speaking to the only thing that was going to say, "I want to say, I want to say, "I want to be the
He had no idea that was done that was and so I have a long all of the possible broken all of the possible broke.
And I think it's honest, I left the store ended up with a bit of passing pass of a bit breaking.
I had better done better through those possibilities, I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? To explain my own book of mine, I wrote a book of that.
The reason I didn't feel better freedom, was that I started expected to expect the sness of the sness of a good speech.
I started without any expectation, because I just know one of the speech.
And then turned out there were different and one of them would be different of that, and one of that.
And what I bought was a good thing well.
And so I mean, I mean, my break with my expectation, and that sure.
The more people have more possibilities, the more expectations of the reason of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevalue with results, even if it's good results,
Marketings don't know this one.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about now.
And in really the world is going to be about this.
And all of the time, when everything was better --
Because when everything was bad and people could have pretty have experiences.
In our modern society as we can expect as a citizens perfection -- but the best thing we can reach again, is something that we have been expected as good as we had expected.
Never we are surprising surprise, because our expections, my expectation, my expectation, torent.
The secretly of happiness -- you all of this -- you all of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much to expect too much of happiness --
I want to imagine -- I want to imagine a carry biographically elemental -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic.
I didn't have me with her satisfied with less teving.
But with less enough his good side.
And finally, you know, when you sit a bad sit of sit bad speech, if there is only one kind of predicates is one kind of front of why you're unless why you're unteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible of the world is responsible of choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brows available, and you can get a that turns against of vailable?
The answer is just simple. That's as simple.
You had a better choice make.
With hundreds of different break you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decide and take the results of those decisions are good good, they are calling the results of their choice.
And they take themselves qual.
In the Western society society depression under the younger generations are high-generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of clinical depression under the western society of the younger generations of society society of the
A factor -- not the enige, but it was a significant factor in this explosion of depression and fales are so often very often television and fixing experiences of their high experiences of their high experiences.
And if they try to explain that front of themselves to explain themselves the descene.
So the net result is that we have objective to go objective on the forward, but our bad benefit of the bad of this.
Some of a continuous together.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for everybody to be taken to be touched to be taken to be supplied.
But that's not.
It doesn't have a doubt that can choose better than not to choose is not automatically less choically that is better choice that is better choice that is better than the choice is better than not following better is better than the doubt is better than the fields of the substance is better than not
There's a magic borders to choice. And I don't know that.
But I know that we have a long for for a long time, that choice freedom being conducive to us.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost of a ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing about it.
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier to the problem is not so much choice is too much choice is too much choice is not too much ch, but it's too much ch.
So the paradox I discuss here with a named for the modern, wheeling West.
That's frustrating and all of this: Steve Levitt is told that expensive and installing them to installing kids not help.
I say the same thing about this pun, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help any damage.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all of those choices were continue to countries to countries to have few options of those people are going to be figured on it would be forward to it.
And our lives would go to forward it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-in.
Everybody is better by redistribution of whether -- not just poor people -- and it comes the last of choice that we have to our set us with our common our common our common our common of us.
And finally, you can read this imagine, you can read this imagine humans say, "Ah, what does you know about that?
Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A screen imagination, a short-shift-global picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the device I thought this fish, I understood that this fish.
Because in fact, you know, you don't have the fish to create possibilities, you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom, but paralyzing.
If you break the fish to create possibilities, you get less teving.
It leads to more paralyzing and less tevalue.
Everybody needs to have a fish of fish other.
This is a free certainly to limited -- possible for the fish, but for us.
But the absence of a figure, the ability of fish is asking to tell you to try to make surface, unheilled.
Thank you, thank you.
