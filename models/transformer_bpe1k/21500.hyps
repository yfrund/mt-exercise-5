Forig years, I show the last year to show that the police cap, who are the last three million years, which was about the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this really, the really, the next of this specific problem because it doesn't show the disease.
The ice capach on the North Pole, in a way, in the classocial climate system.
It set in the winter and crack in the summmits in the summmits in the summmits in the summmits in the summmits in the summits in the summits in the summmits in the summmits in the summmits in the summmits of the summmp and crinkitys.
The next slide I show you is a fastly version of what the last 25 years is happening.
The permanen-ice ice is reduced in rood.
As you can see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the yearal issue ice ice ice ice ice issue.
And it cricks, in the summer.
And the so-called permanent ice, five years or parent, is almost like flower, which is like flower,
In 25 years is gotten the from this to this is this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrated and there's a very big amount of the North amount of frozen carbon frozen carbon died, when it designed by microbes in methane.
Fore with the total amount of the total amount of atmosphere, would double the amount of the atmosphere, if we can describe point to the corporate point to describe age.
In one of the water deep in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Africany winter winter went from the University Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another team to another team to another unep member.
Whoo! She's asky is real if we are going to be that.
And for that, is that this enormous "warmbron" Greenland from the northous.
This is a smell squakly squaterriver.
The waterfully is the water than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussion in South issue Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legle because it is the country because it country to be the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea result.
These streams are taking flights.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the largest ice mass on Earth.
Africans made scientists scientists that all continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly very quickly on the squicklands.
The whole continent is for six meters for six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the size of the ice of ice now are new now new now that are new now highly glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population is getting the half of his dress water of that small.
In the Andes, this gler the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, you also much it took water.
In California was there a 40 percent of the Sierra.
It comes in the waterres reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions of it.
This global dream, this is a dramatical stycle of burning burning burn.
And the number of natural currently and never seemed with an incredible and never seemed to be seeing fast.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the prepresented 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the primary context than curating what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 to give 10 million ton CO2 hour.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Kook to the east, from the east, from America, from America, availled from the Indian ae of the Indian ae subcontinent, there is a drawise of oxygen in the oceans.
The only major causing the Earth, next to design on the Earth, which is buries, which is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stonly is the all greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extenans, with China.
And there was a presentally more urban to build lots of more urban centralize call.
But we see a couldn't see a couldn't see a couldn't see a moment.
These are the voice carbon curved in the last of the last years, and where green alternatives and where green alternatives were proposed in the last years.
There's a political strized on the country.
The voice coal and oil-industiled in 250 million dollars to promotly from "sunkilled to promot "small-powerful skill --
And that picture to think about something like this.
Rond the churchase, at me, at me at the time in Tennessee, four billion literally moded to be four billion literally moded to believe money model.
You probably have seen the news of the news face.
This is the one after a long after fall.
This is happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising lines of the Constrial subject was the Kerstical was thing.
Video: ""Frosty the coolman is a blice, operated churely.
He is overflength in America, and he he's put in America, and he put that our economics.
Frosty the cup, with the day becomes with the day.
He's pay and hold and cutty and hold their bank."
Here's a big comes in the West Virginia from West Virginia from day.
The biggest mes. The biggest malaxy Coal.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me be clearly clear. Al Gore, Nancy Red, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Allimate protection for Klimate protection for two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "Bd COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threating for our things.
That's why it is the reason why it's the most important thing to give a gigantic concerned to the light and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of truth and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth is to give a gigan
Feit is, stonly is not smart.
We find that slept is -- and it's still leaker still chall.
So, you don't make care about climate change.
Let me just have us gotten this.
Video: Acurity: Schonic, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern citypermodern city-cle-counent counent counent counent of course.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of lawn.
But that's the sound of sune sounds of song-bools technology.
Onspite the fact that the fact that the burning causes of the most important causes of the Earth is change the earth is, change the remarkable set of the Earth, salong technology that you see here.
Look around the same time, this is the single technology of today.

Video: America is wrong in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire wirely of these business, our dependence of fossil fuels, as polluted oil, as policy.
But now there is a durful, new solution to get this.
Fore-America 100 percent crosation, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to the work of the work of the work that we make us safe the securits of the Earth.

Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old Africans says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go far far far and say."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Forig year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called back with a hopdate about how that works.
So here I am here. For those who didn't have anyway, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever underneath in the miles of the scientific experiment in the miles of the scientific experiment in the miles of this.
It needs to be the cird of the circumstances that were less than a billion second after the universe to 600 million times a second of second million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, thus!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs brown in detectors of the ATLAS detectors -- 44 meters the ATLAS detector -- 22 meters in diameters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the agriculture.
On 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That so, that made a party for a party of the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and the detector.
With other words, when we knew that picture on 10 September knew that the machine working, which is a huge considered in the machine.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of the biggest and went to Google and saw that the Internet page, and then the Internet page.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
And we had a week later, we had a problem with the machine, what had to do with these gold behaviors.
And those behaviors 13 thousand thousand amper resilt the machine on full power.
The engineers are saying, "Not true. It's too small of you will say, "Not tiny true.
They can do that because they can do superperateive on whole low temperaturs.
So on miles away from the space between the girls, who can destribes that behaviors that behaviors.
In one of the constructions between the nine of the LHC, sat a constructive.
And then the wirelectrical was there there there was a electrical against 13 thousand amples that 13 thousand ampong against 13 thousand ample of the against of the wirelectrical against of the wirelectrical reflects.
This was the result.
This is still inpressides when you realize that magnets more than 20 tons and away they were deployed about 30 centimeters in the same timeter than 20 percentimeter in the same timeter than 20 percentimeter than 20 tons that made magic realize that magnets have been infright?
We have a sated, about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it.
We all have them all tool.
Now they're going back away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather.
We will continue again, and we expect to measurements in juniverse, so we can look at what the building the universe.
Now, of course, have been incredibate of the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research of science.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be beyond beyond the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I move the device experiments of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning Michael Faraday, this is a dangerous than to take the human being science of the human beings of science, that there are not completely that there are no reading our primary ded that we dicultist, and that we design, and that there are no read."
Thank you!
I would like to start to ask with you to ask to your kids to your kiddle and then you play with blocking.
When you discovered how to understand how to understand and awarence and award, you know, you actually solve the problems with the problems with the engineering with the surrounded relationships.
Rumultimately is strong because with the understand the world to understand us.
If an information became inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- samples with my advisor, Pattion and my medember Jeevannase, I started to ask -- what if we were a computer to ask -- what if we would use a computer to be a computer to be a kind of a mouic fingingerian to a plate bread, what information is in a place to a breastribured to the bread, which is fy-broastance of information that we can unch fymyself information with a moves of information that we can fysular inter,
and can we want to leave orders, as we want to leave it?
This question of us so decided that we decided to see a answer of Siftables.
Cort say, is a Sift of an interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be failing with the hand they can feel each other, their movement and they failed a screen and they contact a screen and contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handled as blocks they can be placed by understand through it looks at it.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the way-information.
And so that these aid are of the aid of physical different of their movement and and even from their movement and even from the way we movement and even from the way we move them and like, there are different new and like, there are different new and interactions of interactions and like.
I'll start with some simple simple examples.
This Sift is instance to show a video to show a video to be played by cancer and otherwise, and otherwise and otherwise played from the backwards.
These interactive portraits are awareness.
Indiences next each other, they will be interesting.
If they become up, they can be realize this and what nervous.
Somebody feeling and hell.
We realized algauw that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interaction, the using of all of the interaction, as it was a small, as it was a small.
In this example three Siftables to remember and I can use them to give them to make color, where they are getting myself in a leggetting color.
And if we have threen, we gotten some back.
There are some clear cumbilities for education, mathematics of education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibilities that people want to give things quickly, and the result of unmidly, and the result of the education.
And here I show you -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci for a simple programatic programatic programatic programatic programatic programatic programatic of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci of a simple programatic resh
And here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every single in every Siftable, and further squeaile, and further dictionary words are control in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is becoming very ship, and different of a new series of series of letters with breakthing.
Thank you.
These are single of the kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I love them to make it out of the Media Lab, and make a video of it.
They were really again, they were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need need to be almost instructions.
All you have to say is "Make word." And they know what they need to do is what they need to do.
Here's some other people on the other people on the test.
That's our young business, right-basically textable.
And it seems that he just single the Siftables wood.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learning language.
This is Felix that demonstreat.
He can bring new karacross the skile, by the Sift with the Sift with that character of the table.
Here's the sun coming up the sun comes up here.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done an! Yeah!
By shake the shift of Siftables and the next to each other, he can reager the characters -- Video: Wllet me -- Video: Wllet high!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decisions how it walks.
Video: The cat fly air.
DM: the last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music chilstrument that we developed recent to developed a sound sound sound the lead, bass and bass and the lead, bass and present and prerum.
Eenious variations where you can choose what you want to use you can choose what you want to use it.
And these sound in the last Siftables are injected in the pattern so you can detern the pattern itself to determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a legal Sift of a legal Siftisher as reverbal effects and filter.
They are being a sound and admition to cance.
Forder the general effects like tempo and volume, and volume, and then the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're going to start with a leaad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, until a first pattern,
Now I place the basic line --
Video: DM: Now I feed some basically to be a little bit work.
Video: That I couldn't have the filter on the drum of the drum of the effect live in the effect live influence.
Video: I can accelerate the obvious by the cancer of the tempo blocks.
Video: Now I couple to the filter on the basic for what more expression.
Video: I can repearing the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvision, but I can improvision, and shorter like I want.
With the dims of the dims of the whole Sift to the left Sift to square to the left society.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people's passion of new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces our brain and lichams.
And today, I had a little bit of time to show you one new element in this designs with some possibilities that we develop the developing of the lab.
The thought I want to bring is that this is just the touch of the tribute to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you to talk to you all and talk to you to all and you know,
I'm writing write.
But, write is my work, but also many more than that.
My lives long long for long and I don't think that ever will change anyway.
And yet there is unless the way in my life and career in my life, and career and career to my relationship, and I had to see my relationship.
It started with a book that I did understand a memoire, "Ets" -- "Biddle, Biddle, Biddle, that very single engineering the entire world, and an international existship.
The result is that people are all all over and always at all, as if I was always draw.
Well, what -- you know, does -- you know, gott!
People come to me and ask to me and ask you and ask this success is never ever ever ever ever equival?
Don't you get to be able to be your entire life writing write write that people will be heat a book is publish where people are going to be writ?
And then you don't have any bang for?"
Sustific room is right you know.
Nature, that would be a very nice that I remember 20 years ago, I was when I told a teenage -- when I told that I wanted to be write that I wanted to become a teenage.
People said, "Ben you don't get any that you never get success is never get success?
Don't you get a bang for it.
And not bang you wouldn't get your life to this work without of this is also something from coming out of your broken and broken on the public bitters of failing your bitters of fail?"
One of that strets.
In the short comes to the questions of this questions that questions are going to ask this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are called
Always of it.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you don't want to know what all of it.
For very example, and other ones and other engineers.
But what is writing write I ask myself the last time that feet.
Is it rational?
Is the logical that somebody is eight bang for the work for the work for the work for the work of the work of their earth are put on Earth.
What is so so so there's so so so so we make our single to make the effects of it on the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the work of the work of all work on the other thing that is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the effects of creative processes that we are made us to be able to make
Take my father. He was skully, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he was in the 40 years that he was asked to him for him or he didn't have bane.
And so said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, so didn't have been talking about it.
And to be fair fair of engineers have been through the century of the century of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
Schee writers, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation.
Look at the grim doors to the grimms under the most magnificent of the 20th century.
Feless, many died, often by own own own again.
And even those those those who don't have a self murdering off, under their gaves under their gaves.
In the last interview for his dead for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself myself in the last interval."
That's pretty what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of kind of looking at the kind of looking at that.
We all heard all before and have all of accepted all of accepted earlier.
The skilled thought is that creativity creativity is understanding is the list of the list stend, and that a artist, and eventually will lead to ellent.
So why are I ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
I think I'm good about it now I think about it all all the way I think it is not all pretty pretty though.
I find it reference.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this this century this century is so going.
We can have creative minds much better to live sports.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to the dark of the dark of the dark of life.
Searned the fase where my career now is now invention.
Go only only afic, I'm still young, amper of the year.
I can make maybe I can work four decade.
Hole probably will be anything I have to have publish through the outside world as the world as the world as the following that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends here with friends on each other, so I can probably my biggest success for me.
Jemically what a idea!
If you think about that, you're going to be for you knows the morning to near hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me song me, with the work where I love with the work where I love from the work where I love from the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love from the work where I love from the work where I love from the work of where I love with the work of where I love from the work of where I love with the work where I love with the work.
The question is: "Hoes quire?"
After long after long after long on the conclusion as I can only be writing as a psychological protection in the process inbuilding inside the process inbuilding inbuilding the process of the process of inside the process of the process of the process that I can only be a psychological protection in the process of the proc
I have to be writing a safe distance between me, and my consider myself and my consider to the reactions for the reactions for the reactions of the reactions on my future publish.
I have been looking at ways of ways to ways that are to ways to ways that.
I have been down in history and have a better way to see or another societies to see if others have found found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been based to the old Great the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Great the time of the ancient of people don't believe that creativity was going to be creativity of themselves.
Men believed that creativity was a good partly of a well, which was a very basically place to the human beings and unknowledles.
The Greeks now called these needs of creativity "demonen."
One Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demp that influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they had a called a called creative mind a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their policy was a genius, a kind of maginary and entity that are opped in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the populating the geniusion.
One of the result he shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's precisely the distance that I had the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection to the required to be a lot of narcism.
If you put billiant bits all the equal of the equal early one.
Everybody knew that a invisible geniusible genius.
Well, you know, you get work on you, then you have not only on you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty unity.
Long time is that the Wests creativity was the Wests creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything change.
There was a very new idea very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attackly from the goddream,
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came to the individual
And for the first time in history of the history was about artists said that they had a genius, and not that they had a geniuse.
I have to say that I have to find that a big failed.
On one person, one person, one person, one of individual individual is the essentially the essentially, the essentially, the essential, the essentially mystery, of all what goddn't have a lot of any desperssibility for a fragial human psych.
as if you ask someone ask the sun in slike.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportions and there's unimaginable, expectations of prestations of prestations and experience.
And I think this pressures the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists being made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think is that question is the question: "What now now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older understand back the relationship between human being?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years of humanism not unforforged in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of spech.
Probably are in the audience people who realized in the audience of scientific creatures have been about the idea that equal creatures with what the work of artists with inspiring the work of artists to inspiring high-temport to inspirate.
It doesn't seem me that I all all of you get in there.
And yet I ask it me.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought wouldn't have the thought?
And the fast night is so much as all other explanations of the total makes of the total calculatornment that decided that creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something that has been trying to create -- so in fact, you know, -- you know, the creative process -- knows that the creative process is always wirational process --
That sometimes almost paranorall.
I have a long the wonderful American dichinesser Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone me.
She's close in the next. Her lives all write they lived to close.
She told me about her jeugginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field, they feel a close they feel a close of country.
It was so said so, as if there was a big wave wave air, as if there was a big wave wave air.
So'll be poemmit waves about the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, under her feel under her feeling and knew that her on that moment but one thing to do is to do for her life.
And she went home, hind home, and she had to see so quickly as quickly as possible and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and home and paper home.
When the poems through her was waves her only waves her only to write it on the observes.
Sometimes she didn't fast.
And then running and running and running the house of the house.
And in such mmoments closer of her sky, on the field, on the field, on search -- in her words -- to another closer words -- to another closer words -- to another closer words -- to another closer words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in the field, on search --
And also there were any -- I think -- this find I think the beautiful part of the story -- they have the close to almost miste.
And then she was in home and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper through her it.
Juist on that moment she had a pot-high-she had a pot-bicture.
And with her other hand, so told me she poems it from the air.
She picked up with his reflect and again, it back in her body in her body written the again.
In those cases came up in that cases in single paper on paper primary paper --
When I heard that heard -- what happens to be my crease -- I thought my creative process
So my creative process is my creative process is not medium!
I'm a mouth mile, who every day on the same time, and sweeks with blood, sweating and swer down and trans and trans out and trans and swell.
But even in that day I have had a experience of experience.
You can also know it myself as you can feel that there creative ideas in your blove ideas in your brown up from a source that you can impossible.
What is that then that source?
How can we use the without that without we become be?
On a way that are good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians I can think is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the through the this.
Tom is a big part of his life of his life have been showed of the wonderful of the wonderful that was trying to get all the power to get to the unpresents of the unition to the unite creative impulses that increative impulses that in him.
With the years was Tom the years of what was roostigate.
On a day he refly in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed it in the process of radical reason the fast,
And as he realize there was so referening a fragmental die.
The decided him, as inspiration that is faking, understand understand the bar, understand
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to the fasth.
But it didn't really do that.
He had no paper too, no tape of piece.
The well-known exciting about the melown, "I went from the melown, and then it kept me equal early backwards me.
I'm not good enough, I can't am it.
He didn't real real real in panic, but he stop that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry heard you don't see that I behind the hind the hind the whether the whether the hin?"
"Do you really think I can be able to write a song on now?
If you really want to get this song -- you have to be later, you have to be later, if I have time for you.
Not not, you know, somebody else last.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohend." And from that moment in the process of the process
The work itself is the same thing with the familiar subject on the same botom.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him curry distance in the engineering of the genius.
The genius, and the genion to the skin and liversed only but just closed up and ressed.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason through go.
It also could be a wonderful balan, bizarre society of conversation between Tom and the ownered that not all the way from Tom self and itself was not very single of Tom itself was a wonderful of Tom itself was a wonderful
That story has changed my way of works.
I had been a profound for a lot of any of this.
I was writing in the middle of Ets, Biddle, Biddle.
On a given moment I fell in despersed in despair.
You know, you know, you don't want to be work and you don't think it is a terrible disastance that it is a terrible book. The book.
Not single bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad b
I wanted to be the whole project all the project of the project all the project of the project all the project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of the wh
And then I remember Tom that I wish to be genius, and I decided to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be currending.
I went from my hands of my manuscricians and direction, and I did to a legal camer.
And I said, "Lister thing, "Lister thing, we know all this book, we know all this book, then it doesn't come through me.
You can see that I have all in the way I have in the stop I have in me.
More can't give it.
And if you find that it have to come better can, you have to come to do your thing in the way.
Snap you don't have a bit of you're not right?
I write write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notors are being fairly fairly that you are just today."
Tja--- Uited -- U.S.
Euws ago, there was in the North African desert African desert to dance to dance to dance in the sact music.
Urens and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But something, very single thing happened there.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I memean, you know, you also have ever seen a performer.
It was like the time the time still and the dance of the stact step.
He didn't have anything else than the thousands of nights of nights, but now everything together.
And suddenly he didn't read longer only a human beings only a human beings one.
In him, under him, under him, under him glours.
A good through fired him.
If something happened to be able to be what it was Dan they started to clap and square people what it was Dan Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun of historical fact, Toen the Moren South Spanel the Moren SSpanel references them to be the high--squarter.
The question is real being the centuries, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, other."
That hus, you know, the day at still stimagins and flaments.
If a artist, in Spane or magically does or magic gotten say, "Allah, other, other, other, other, broad."
One of understand -- sic: a glim of God.
Privers what we need it.
Lastiled is the dance that the next morning to the next morning that he discovered to be 11 hours of the morning of the morning charge more displaw.
And at that moment is he never read a little bit of every high-high-high-high-high high high high high high high high high high high high high high high high high high high high hig
Maybe never going to never anybody God anybody at the dance,
What to he now have to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to squares for a creative mind.
But so painful need to be the way.
And imagine you don't have been exciting that the most unusbaspects of your person from yourself.
And imagine you believe that you have a while, she had a while,
When you are ready to get there.
And so it considers, it counts.
I dependent in the middles.
The last months I've worked on a book, that is going to be different. It book, and the book, and book a lot of reach long to be a lot of reach long to be a book,
The follower of that illust.
If my thought with me on the hold I love me the same thing that said, "Well, not bank. See doesn't have the same before.
And so you just put your work.
And just like you do this, what it is.
If you task you very task to dance.
If the goddressing that you is to decide to decide in your work on enious moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources, "Ol.
And then not, then, thance you know, dance through through it.
And also then, "Ole !"
I believe that I believe heart.
"Ole anyway, because we have from pure human love, because we are still from the wisdom and own wisdom by the message.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what it can mean and what it meaning new sets of genes.
We started actually starting a new point of point, we were the digitalize of the digitalize of the digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology to design and synthetic designing life.
So we've always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different level.
We tried to have different approached different approached to minimum components.
We're now going to be able to the digitalization.
When we have sequency the human genome of the analog world of the biology, to the digital world, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask for questionate life, or can we live to live new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a small organism in a laboratory of a small organism,
And we can have tried to look at a nonce of smaller genome.
We can go in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, which relatively relatively relatively with the unction.
Gove me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look piece of all of the genes that we can look at the living cell that this is a living cell cell.
We decided to ask that the only route prevalue to this chromosome of synthetic so we could make the components to be so that we could make the components to ask the componently questions to ask a few of the most fundamental questions so that we could ask this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as wonder, "Can we have a chromospsphere, "Can we started a chromospsphere?"
Steat the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never seed?
And, if we do that, can be a chromosphere, "On?
A chromosome of the chromosphere, but a piece of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is accelerating exponential windown.
Our ability to write the genetic code of loser slowly slowly long, but is genome.
And our last point would be on this moment would places on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical tsing for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is is very hard to be difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the more folks to be more folks than be.
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little pieces of these little pieces and corrigators.
And this was our first power to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the foutcorrection,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting particular as we started a piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria stops, and the bacteria of code genetic code and read viral particles and make viral particles and make the bacteria particle particles and make the bacteria of chemical currening particles and reads.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they were from the cells, they came back and death, and dead the E. coli.
I was unled in the oil industry, and I said that they model but I said that model but all the model but all the fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software building his own hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much bigger bigger thing.
We wanted to build the completely bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes in cassetttes of viruss, so we could variance the cassettles.
to understand what the real components of a living cells of living cell.
The design is crucial information in the computer than in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that.
When we first first this genome is called this genome in 19995 was the standard-precision one per 10,000 basepares.
And then we found after we found after 30 fouts. If we had the original sequence of the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the designing of 50 letters who are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they can design to build designing so that they can design to design so that they can design to design so that they can design to design so that they can design to build up with all the other piec
We designing here unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read to the water mers that we have water notices.
Beus, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for 20 aminozers -- there is a single anozero-currently clearning for every aminozur.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words on the words of thought.
And then we only called "measure, we only could."
Some were closed that there were no poems there were no poems were not close.
We designed these pieces so we can dealing them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repairs and they put in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters were longs, and you have a long and you have a 24,000 letters, and you have a 24,000 letter, until 700.
In every stedium week, we want to flassed them of these so we could sequences to sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuust -- that will be very robuilt -- that will straks.
We try to achieve the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come up to the really great pieces -- more than 10,000 basepars -- more than 10,000 baseparate in E. coli.
That is the expensive of all modern tools of modern modern biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombinations called "homology to repapers, that is used by the biology to repapers, which is basically food.
Here's a single of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiods.
And that see you in the top panel, soil singers just crack out of each other.
12 observes later later, he was the again, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely opened being totally became a bit of the eyes.
They can live in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can be existencouple of the space of the aquatic environment.
NASA has truly to show that there is a lot of of there, there's a lot of there.
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with the right design with the right design of the same design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the microps that we did them in the microphotograph of the molecule that
Great it makes automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscoppphotograph; this is a reason microscope.
It's such a big, molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the published we unleft unning unlononly.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's made the biggest molecule of molecule, with a clear structure.
The moleculecule weight is more than 300 million soleculeculecules
If we would just take it with a 10-points letter, without spations and then there's 142 pages only to pressure, only to pressure,
Good we started a chromospsphere? How do we activate it?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give under eukaryots, as well, you know, just just the cell cell of the cell cell and then another in, and that's what you known.
And in the bacteria of the bacteriia of integrated in the cell but we can show to show that we have a complete transplant transplant transplant to a different, and can active.
We have a chromosphere, we have a microbbone.
These are about so far as far as far as people and mously muship.
We found some extra little bit of the extra for this chromosphere.
We have the failing with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the egs.
It was pretty sensational when we can put this in the cell -- and you will move the very avanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to be only to square to be the process what we were trying to develop the process what further to develop the process.
This is an essential evolutional evolution,
We found all sorts of all sorts of chromosome of chromospspheres have been certain of the third of thousands of properties in one time of the species.
People who are evolution to presents as if there are one of the same change in the same changes not much biology community.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that really called DNA ress.
The chromosome that in the cell has not ever ever eat.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop in -- well, well.
It was expressecurrently the other chromosome of chromosome of material, and then we had to be up the cell of the cell with the cell of the new chromosing;
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time in a very short time of the characteristics of the kind of basically and shaped in the new species, and changed on the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software stopp.
All the same change, the membrans changed -- when we change the genetic code -- when we had the genetic code in which changed.
This may be sounds like genomician, but we're in state, by change the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things
Good I have been paid better that this is not a chep -- this is not a skully, on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camburieal scale, basically based on this digital scale, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to be able to get insix-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context place, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for every of us that are going to be in 1946; within 40 years, that there are four being four before.
We have a lot of food with food with food with food burning water, medicine, fuels for the six entire of the six-on-on-on-half billion.
That's becomes to do that.
We use five billion colls, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in ogence, or whether you have a huge challenges to replace.
Then there is natural all that carbon dioxide of the stor that is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is a little bit of the stor that carbon dioxide of the stor that in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is a curall.
And for all of our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I like to see as the designs for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozens a dozero-by-basically comes out of diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the electronics.
We are presently limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a single synthese, snamed for a called "combinations to do so called "combinations of the combinations of called "combinations of technique synthesians.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the destribute of 20 million different genes or results to optimalize octan, and then we can produce octan, new vaccines, we can produce a small team biology than in the last 20 years than in the last 20 years of science than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatable, chemical or fuel, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design of what real designs that we work on the design, and a new species on the computer, and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see it from there.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code out of the genetic code
We focus on fourth generations.
One longs have seen to ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have two-third generation and third generation will come from coming from coming from coming from sugar like sugar fuels like octan, to more high-kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can be biology without the food price without the food price higher and available to reduce the food price is as we start with CO2 as his food and designs that we do it in the way that we do it in the first squartery that we do the first fired generation in the first fires of the first to have been about 18 months to have burband, and massive billed to have breave.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we all have the global discovery, we all all sorts of other methods of other methods of other methods --
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles deep, at coin, at coin, cooking the squeekly.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water stand with molecule-hydrogen as energy source.
We can take a look at the time we can take cup, what easily via pipate to fabries, where that CO2 is being CO2 becomes back to fuel this process to burning this process to burning this process to burn.
So in a short time we think we are in a short of basically asked on the basic question question: "What is life?"
We actually have a realize -- you have the purchemical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, what you?
A important energy source become source.
But we work now is using these works, to think fast fast to be fast fast series of series of series of course.
This year was the flu one, we just just just just a little bit behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccin.
I think that can change by may change by testing vaccines of the vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see the future of evolution tree is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolutionary and eventually evolukaryota.
We are define improved from people.
Our goal is certainly to sure a chance to survive long enough to survive enough to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we basicrosoft to Microsoft is about a year ago. This is Seed-basicon.
And it's a environment where you can get local or on the immense of visual data can work on the visual data can work on the way that you can work on the way that you can work on the way that you can work on the away you can work on the whether you can work on the rise of the environments that you can work on the distance that you can wor
We look at this here many gigabytes on digital images and can just remains on the including and then made the sort of engine, and then the sort of terms and squarters to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information, how big, how big, how bigs.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a photographs, but this is a small of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of this normal digital camera photographs, but this
It all doesn't matter because it's only what the prestations would be influence, on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-picture.
This is the graue of Dickens. Every column, is a chapter.
And to prove that it really is that it's really too, and not picture, we can do something like this is a real to show that this is not picture.
Maybe this is a squire way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't have it.
This is a realistician, example. This is a example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part.
This gives you real the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or capital paper is actually a scale medium.
We also have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertised from high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertising extra normal advertising information information information information information information information --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you want to see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do that we can really do the limits of across the limits of accounts.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other third flaure.
Of course, land-courses for the hand on a technology like this, I won't spend up here at a technology as this, I will spend up to this field, except that we can contribute this field.
These are all the weighs in the U.S.
And the top of the NASA -- the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of the vision of Noah Snavely, promovement to the University of Washington, means ago, the University of Seitz on U.W.
and Rick Srki at Microsoft Research. A beautiful continuing.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, when we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the pictures has meaning here.
The computer-vision algorithms have been continued to the real sponding -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades of stabilized diashind diashoned diashws or panorama panorama panorous diashits of panormous diashood failed to be basically basic failable to be countly well.
I don't know sure or there is time another time is a different environments.
There are much space.
I want to be a Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we were working this summer -- to the communicate what I was in my heam is the real power of this technique, at the environments of these environments on our website.
We had to love with the advocaturious and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You see see the Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get pictures of people in tshirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the camps of the people in tribes of the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus
And every of this orange orange of orange that are part of this model of this model of this model of this model of model in this model of model of this model of model in the model of this model of this model of this model of this model in the model of this model in the model of this model in the model of this model that are part of this model of this model of this model.
So all of Flickr picks, who are all the way that are spaced in this way.
And we can casionly wise.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever been at Microsoft to Microsoft
It's so overwhelming here is so much to be so critical here.
I believe you can see that this many types are cameras are cameras, everything from glasses of the mirror cameras, a big number of them.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much of through faces and so much of them.
And then between this, even between a series of photographs -- here's a series of photographs --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also good by the program.
If we had through the poster in a physics of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do with the social environment. This uses now the data of everyone -- from the whole of the whole collective memory of the Earth -- and heads, the Earth of it -- and sells that everything on each other.
All these pictures are being each other, and shapes together than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth Aarth.
And so, this as a completely at Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexities when the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being metaph-data who are inferent.
If somebody would like to click all these squarters, and their names, then my photograph of the Notre Dame along Dame data, and I can use as a access to the space, which I can use as a access to the metaphold of anyone of the metaphold of anyone of cross-modits of cross-modal, and created experience.
And of course, it's the airly product a momen's rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from air, who don't only from air, who don't only from the airplanations and other passocial pictures is distand, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what you can make your software possible in the next years, all images that are ded by everyone on the world that can be particular the world?
BAA: Yeah. What this really doesn't do it.
And the creates creates, hyperlinks between pictures.
And it doesn't do that on the imaginations.
And that designed exciting when you think about the riches of semantic information that mantic information that many of these images.
When you look at the web looks for images, you can see a search and the text of the webpage, and the text of what the image, and the text picture.
What if you picture?
And then then the number of the number of the number of the amount of the amount of the amount of the purpossibility.

I have been picture on the northern of Baffin Island genomes, when I was came up with Iner's narrow high-high--high-high--high--high-high-high--high--high--baffin Island genomes on narrow.
This guy, Olayught me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canaded government is not always friendly for the Iner; in the 1950s, they were equived to the inition of the souldn't have been place.
The opa of Olayuk weigned to go.
The family of the family of his life, and nam him all his wapens, all his wapance.
Now you have to understand that the Infrom the collabor, they made it for the collected.
The glist of their sleets were originally made of their books were made from fished in a current.
Olayuks opera was not bang for the pollnight or the storm that wirely well.
He went out, like, shaped his broken skin his hands and put in his hands. And then the population of the poop, he started to free.
He basically a low of the message of the message of the mess.
And when the solid was, he sleep, he was a dog member
He did the dog and improvision and improvised a harnas.
From the ribbenefits he made a bad.
He was dogs in the neighborhood and disappeared on the ice flacive poops.
Over with nothing right nothing comes around and this, in many symbol for the weather of the Infrom the Infrom the Infrom the Infrom and all indiculating the world.
In april 19999 gave the Canaded government the Infrom the entire country to be back from a country and Texas samples and Texas samples of Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's independent area. They results.
It's a blueffect of how a native of how a native of the native of her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly clearly to this holds to this home who's required that they don't really get far away to be far away to be far away to be far away to this high--basically wouldn't get away to this hold the world is really clearly not away to this home to this holks to this highly is true.
They are somebody's home longs.
They are standing for the human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for all of the time. And for all of these children, just as that of the unction, part of a unconcerned of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extension of the idea that politicians never accounts.

We make a lot of equal fairly to the eath of the public, to our audience, to make a single cultural places, where the concerned by what he sees seeing out of what he seeing is so hopefully the main opening opening opening opening the anthropology will be diversion and living in a midence of reading and realistic world and living in a multure, and plure world and plure world and plure world and plurificiture in a might find to lives.
where all the wisdom of all the volution can contribute to us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I dealing a book,
Maybe you see paralls you to call paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain which you may be mistakes that you may be mistaking.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precision to be precisial dogma of all the western aways, industrialized society.
And that official dogma ligma light of the citizens on the highest levels on the highest level, we have to get them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a great is a great deal, a big, part of the human existence.
Bovenuists stalk our ovenue to reach own to reach a higher wonderful to achieve a higher wonderful without of thing.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically wonderful more wonderful wonder.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would be durved in our society.
And also in our lives living in our life-basically.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A A middle.
Even thressing.
And at that 175 can-hold dressings are in my supermarkets, there are in my supermarkets, extra-virgin oil virgin old and developing different balsamicos and develop.
And then you can make a number of the breakthree between that was 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics. You can see itself your stereoset together -- amazing players, cd-players, cassetespecially distance.
And in the same electronics and you can choose from this number,
You can see six en-half million different systems together with subject with the botts, with the results of those stores.
Give too -- then you have a lot of chain.
another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could all all sorts of all sorts of telephonservices, but only at Ma Bell.
You're not going to be writical it.
That had the basically had never been report to be walk piece of this.
That time is predict.
Today are very different to be a lot of different streams.
Fore of cell phones is the diversity is immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- who are with mid-her leger and creral cup, and creral corture.
Wellight you have this model in the wink of the mally, but you can certainly be sure that that that inside that happens.
The consequence, people are going to come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question that question that question that question.
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a possible that doesn't do a lot of it.
And also in aspects of life that are much more important than the attacks, is this explosive towards the choice of choice of choice of choice of choice of choice that are much more important than the attact of the society of spular than the anyone of the society of the society of the society that are more important than the coupects of the moment.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. including -- it's in the U.S. including the doctor, and you tells you to do what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and then says, "We can do that, we can do it.
has this presentation, and then cleans.
has this presentation, and then what do you want to do?"
And you says, "Dokter, what do you?"
And the doctor, "Anase, this predicts, and then this other, and then this other,
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Dokter, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call call of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, the shape of decision of decision of someone with shift -- the doctors -- to a leak -- the doctor, somebody who has been certainly sick and not the best conditional cludes -- the patient of the recipated closed corners are ressember reaks.
Good protect sleep that ners, because the bottom, you can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why do we make them, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctors to ask our doctors to ask that other markay.
Our identity, yet a require, as a real aspect of our being the existence, as you can see on this slight on this slights, as you can see on this slight of us, as you can see on this dia.
Our identity is standing our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every chard morning to the opposition to think what you want to be person you want to be there.
Let's talk about the same through the sky.
There is a time that freereereereereereedomic from from from from from from from that you can move so quickly as possible as possible as possible to kids start.
The only realizens was with well, not when and what you did you did did to do any and then you did it.
Now freedom, freedom.
I give lesson lesson intelligent students, which I developed 20, I asked less homework less than early early than early equipend.
They are not shear as well, if you like, in the moment.
No, they have drop with choices.
"Well, I married whether now?
Or I'll be wait? Now I first children, or a career or a career or a career re?"
These are all single questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, as this means that they don't have all their homework and therefore not all their homework and then not a good clean.
And they are right. It's important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just just just just that technology to work every minute every minute of every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph How countor.
There is one place, I think I would like this, where WiFi the gotttinured the got.
I don't want to keep because I want to keep place for myself.
But any any choice choice of work in that we are going to ask us in that we are going to ask us on the time, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footballowed of our son the son the song, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and well, maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all all from standards, we all all every minute every minute with all kinds of question: "Well, I ask this phone caller?
And I would respond this emailt reager? And I writer?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we found the footballowed the footballow.
Where we look at look, the big, the big, materialistic baks, living bits lifestyle, life is a questions.
And so the world outside the world out.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a questions.
And so the world now looks now out.
The question is nowing rite or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of the question is now?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what there is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on the ment.
A very hone-posed effect is that the earlier before than basically basically basically before.
And with so many choice as possibilities to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investiguous pensive to investiguous pensions.
A colleaguard of me had access to invest data of Vanguard, a big policy-in-in-in-in-engineering society of a million devices about 2,000 fighbits.
And they discovered that for every times, that for every teaching the working, the participated two percent describe two percent described two percent depent.
And in fifth fundred 10 percent less worker than functions, with five fund fund fund fund. Why?
Because it in fundress fundress fundress the people just went to choose the people just went to the next day, and then and so on.
And from the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight comes from the straight comes from outside out.
That means not only that people are after their pensioned to eath their pensioned because they don't have a tributed because they don't have a money knowing that the choice that they were conference to have the work of them shoot for them to have slept to shoot it for a single for them.
And they walked up with 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worker was namely to doubled their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute to double.
So a lot of choice can work on the flassocial works.
And I think the world there is so from there.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make very love the right choice makes make a very blows, right?
You don't want to be sated with the wrong fonds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the distribution of our distribution and choose to the result of our distrial than the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of our options had less options as we had less optifect.
There are members for the reasons for that.
And one of the choice, for example, for example, in the longs, backwards the choice can't be perfect perfect that the choice was not perfect perfect
You can imagine in such a case for that another choice would be better better of the choice.
This is dreamed alternative alternative solic for you to get from your choice.
And then does break on the choice of the choice that you have made you have made a good choice.
The more options of the easy of the easier to have the message of unaverse easier to have eight every eight early early early of the result.
A second reason has been to do with substitution.
Then Gilbert gave from the morning of the value of things we depended the value of the things we depent.
If you can inand you can inand you can inand you can also see all fast the attractive of all the alternatives that you wise.
That makes you get less tevilious with the alternative that you have choses.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is a little bit of the privation of this example.
This is a basic on the Hamptons.
They have a single second windown.
They are stranged to a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Beause can't be like, "Fordik," thinks that man, "It's auggirl.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city is the city of my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of my neighborhold in Manhattan is in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city.
I could classed my car for the door, I could parker."
And he is there two weeks to simply that he was every day that he was every day of a great parking place fail.
Substitution, costs are going to be cost of the entire we from our choice we have from our choice choice.
And the more possibilities, there are more possible alternatives.
And those presents, as we are presents.
another example.
This pictures are going to square to some points.
Life in the here and now you don't have to continued things that you don't have to continue to the things that you don't have to concerned things.
another thing that you have a point is that you except other choices are exception.
And all that other has so be so much of the objects, which is resilled option less attractives.
And third is the escalation of expections.
I came up with this through my search to a new brow.
I always saw always to always a always of always I always speaking.
Frower was only one species of the speech, and that cows you know, the past, it doesn't past, it doesn't be unbelievable, but if you were the broken and often the broken and often enough and feeling enough and feeling enough the right, OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to show a speak this is my sing."
And the store said, "Wilt you smart faim fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you have a ritis? While is you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a break with squeeeither effect?
Wilt you can go out and expensive pipals, or flink on pipion." And so he walked up and so he walked up and so he walked up and so he walks.
I was talking about it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to be the only brows."
He had no idea that was wrong that was and so I have a long all the possible broken all possible brows passes.
And I just so, I set the wink of the wink of a bit of a brow.
I had better better thane. I couldn't have it.
But I don't feeling better.
Why? Because this on myself from myself from myself, I written a book.
The reason I don't feel better felt with all that choice was that I started to expect more expect speaking the snite of a good speaking of a good speech.
I started without any expect, because I just know one of the kind of speaking.
And then turned out there were different different and one of the became perfect.
What I was bought I was bought I was not perfect.
And so I mean, I was my broken with my expectation, and that stelted me and that stream.
The more possibilities people have expectations of the services of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevilled with results, even if it's good results.
Marketings don't know this thing.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about now.
In really going to be about it.
All was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was bet
Because when everything was bad of people have pretty pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society can be as wonderful as well-citizens, but the best thing we can achieve ever expect is that something so so so well is as we had expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to expect it.
Never we are surprising to be surprise, because our expections, my expects, torent.
The secret of happiness -- this is all of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much of happiness is not too much of happiness.
I want to ask here -- a car biographic elemental elemental elemental elemental -- that I had a fantastic fantastic elemental --
I didn't have her with her teving.
But with less enough less enoughs have good cans.
To blo: When you can sit a bad salize of a bad as one of the bad as one of a front of front being why you won the questions why you unteve.
The answer is that case, simple.
The world is responsible ase. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you can buy available to fall, and you to fall is the responsible of different break?
The answer is just so simple. That's simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows you don't have excusion.
So if people decisions are ned, even if the results of those decisions of those decisions of those decisions.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western society depression des ssion under the young generations high generations are higher generations of the young generations of the western generations of leavail.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor at this explosive towards this explosion of depression of depression and myself is so often television of their high-experiences.
And if they are trying to explaining themselves to explaining themselves themselves.
So the netoresultain is that we have objective on the front of this, but our bad us feel.
And another society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everyone for everybody for where everybody is taken for where everybody is taken on everybody for everybody for everybody for everyone for everyone for everyone for everybody for everyone for where everybody is true.
But that's not.
It doesn't seem choose better than not cools, but not automatically choos; but then you don't closes better better is more choice better is more choice better than that.
There's a magical boundary bounds. I don't know anyway.
But I know we already long for the point that choice is that choice is being the point of the before that choice is already aw.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost almost almost -- a principle where we can love the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of it.
The choice in industrialized countries to be from material considered from material overfluence.
There are many places on the world, we have earlier earlier is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice.
The paradox I was talking about here, so with name for the moderned for the modern, wish West.
That's frustrated, and you know, Steve Levitt has told you yesterday that was told and lastil to installing children kids don't help.
I say the same thing about this distrike, complicated choices -- they don't help Erger so.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all those choice to make countries where people are going to be options of the people have to go and put that people on it.
OK, we would go on the presently wouldn't go on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-better improvement.
Everybody is better by restory of wonderful -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have to do with our meeting with us.
And finally, if you read this picture, you know, a picture as a developed human says, "Ach, what does you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a vision common in a fis."
A schal imagination, a short of the world's picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I did this fish is that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: if you break the fish to create possibility, but you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom, but lamong, you don't have freedom,
If you are the fissues to create possibilities to create possibility.
It leads to more distribution and less tevily.
Everybody has to need a vision now.
This is freedom, it's freedom, even for the fish for the fish, but for us.
But the disciousness of a figure, is asking questions to call the way to ellent, unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
