For year, I showed these two slides to show that the polar cape capacity that the last three million years of the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent crops.
But this underestimated the worst of this specific problem because it doesn't show the did of ice ice problem because it shows now.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the summer.
The next slided slide of what happened version of what happened the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened in the last 25 years of what happened is a version of what happened to do is a version of what happened the last 25 years of what happened to be a version of what happened to happened to be a version of what happened to happened to happened to be a versi
The permanence is room in red.
As you can see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the yearal ice ice during the winter.
And the crace in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, or five years or old, is almost like blood, which is almost like blood, which is almost like bloom here.
In 25 years of this to this in this crazy.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Ice, and there was a very great amount of frozen amount of frozen carbon methan, when it is depends methan, when it was designed by microbes of methan.

For year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am here. For those who weren't -- the LHC is the most scientific experimental ever suppose, 27 kilometers in the crace.
It must have the conditions that were pretty less than a billion second second after the universe, until 600 million times a second of second second.
Enorm bitious, this!
This is the machine under Gengineering
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs in detectors of the detectors I work with work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
On 10 september, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party corporation in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all around the LHC went around the LHC with operated the LHC with a piece of the LHC, which is in the detector of the LHC, which is in the detector of the detector of the LHC, and with a piece of the first particled of the first particle of the first particles.
In other words, when we saw those picture on 10 September we had that the machine worked in the machine works, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the greatest in the biggest of this, or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of this.
That means that we have a both of cultural as a scientific impact.
And we had a little later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these gold.
And those days ago, 13 thousand amper reass when the machine on full power on the full power on the full power on the full power and amper and crows.
The engineers are going to say, "No true. It's too small wonder you."
They can do that because they superceive superceived on whole temperaturs.
So at me, in 271 degrees, can colder than the stars, who can go into the stars, who can read that drags that would be drags that behaviors can remained the stream between the stars,
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, Sat a constructive.
And that was that wire was something that was happened to be there was a electric resistance against 13 thousand amper res
This was the result.
This is still impressive, if you realized that magnets more than 20 tons of weavailable to go away that these magine 30 centimeter.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have them tool,
Now, they are back to go back away.
Eind the LHC weather will be intact.
We will put him again, and we expect measure in June or June or June or June so we can go further with the buildings of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, that have happy about the value of science, and it's easy research research.
I think it's the fact that it's so hard to be the fact that we go further than ever ever beyond the LHC.
I leave the last words on English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was dededed device, I did the device experiments of his learning experiments of his teachers was Michael Farael Fara's progress than represented the progree of human mind than remembers of science that there are no mysteries in natural that there are no mysteries are in natural that we are completely in natural that we are completely designed that we design,
Thank you!
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your childhood and and and and and playing with blocks playing blocks playing with blocks playing blocks playing blocks to start to ask to your childhood and and and and I would like to start to ask to your childhood and and and I would like to start to ask to your childhood and to go back to your childher and play to start back to your childhood and and and and and and play to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to your child to go to go to your child to your child in your childrenter.
And when you discovered how to understand how you had to understand consciously consciously solved by learning and hanters of space with and hanters of space relationship to be
Ruimtant insight is a strong convalue with the world to understand us.
If an information -- what if we were inspired by physical interaction with objects -- together with my advised objects -- and my felt Jee of Kalanithi -- what if we used to be used to ask -- what if we used a computer of computer -- what if we used a computer information as a kind of digital fingers that moves in a plate that moves in a plate of information that we could put frame,
and can orders like we want?
This question of us so concerned that we decided to look for an answer to the build of Siftables.
Short of a cookied of a interactive computer size of a cookie.
They can be moving with the hand they can be able to make them together, their movement, and they detect a screen and wire them a wire contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handelleability, as blocks they can be moved by understand
And the totables are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And before these resources have a more physical difference, aware of their movement, and even of the way we have a movement and even this, there are different new and fun interactions of the way we have a found new and fun.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifty is institude, to show a video that are playing to do a video gample and othersice playing and othersice playing the back of the revalue and others playing a video gample of other.
These interactive portraits are of conscious conscious.
Indis next to each other, they will be interests.
If they are surrounded this and they can do some nervous.
And they feel et, they movement, and hone-hone-fel.
We realized that one of the interesting consequence that one of the interesting of these interesting interesting of all of the interesting of the interesting of a color or was a fluid --
In this example three Siftables away to go and use them to go into a leg, where they are using them to go into a leg, where they get mixed to be color in a legacid.
And if we have drive, we go back what we go.
There are some cappe of capabilities for education, mathematics with language, mathematics and logics and logics where people want to give things fast, and the result to see things fast.
Here's the shot of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmmatic calculator.
Here's a game that we show here is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a clect leavailable of any Siftable, and feed words are controlled in a dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary work.
After about 30 seconds it is being a new letters of reshake a new letters with bities,
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm looking at it out of making it out of making it and make a video of making it and make a video of making thing.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people need to have instructions that people need no instructions to have instructions
Everything you have to say "Make word" and they know exact what they should do.
Here's some other people on the test of the other people on the test one.
That's our younger benta tester, right?
And it seems that he just seems to Siftables wish.
For him was only blocks.
Here's a interactive paintingly shown ad.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can be new characters in the scene of the scene with that character the Sift-capable with that character of the table.
Here's going to get here,
Video: The Sun, right.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done any!
By the shake of Siftables and the next to put the characters to respond to each other, well, wonder We're reach other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decided how it distriks.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I will show you that I'm going to show Is a synthesizer and live music to be recent to developed that we developed to be a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
Once has a variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sound them in Siftables can be importables so that you can determinated the pattern its so that you can detern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leg-Siftable live controlllabored available effects like reverb and filter.
They are being a sound and advanced by cance.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, until a lead pattern of a lead.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: DM: Well, I feel what I feel a little bit of bad.
Video: That M: And now I couldn't the filter on the drum of the drum of the effect live inflend.
Video: DM: I can accelerate the cancering of the obo block you.
Video: DM: Well, I couldn't have the filter on the basaxis for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repeated the pattern while the pattern.
So I don't have to planned everything to plann, but I can improvise long, the gets of making it and shorter making the shorter of it.
And with the end, the dimms of the entire showing to sole.
Thank you.
And as you can see, my passion from making new people, and I went to make new people, which are better interfaces that our brains and work our brains and work on the way our brains and work on the way our brains and work on the way our brains and work on the way our brains and lichames.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some possibilities that we developed to develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is only the attack is just a new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world like we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it with you.
I'm writing write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My life long life long I'm going to writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And there is something that I had been going to be a couraged in my life and career and career and career and career and I had to re-re-re-re-again.
And it started with a book I wrote that I wrote undergood, "Eten, Biddle, Biinner," which is very residency to my first work work about my first work world and an international existed in the world and an international existed
The result is that people are all over the whole and always I have to do anywhere I have been down to it.
Well, what -- you know, what --
People come to me and ask me and ask me to say, "Don't you never say, "Don't you never have to never succcess?
Don't you get to write your entire life write write write write that people will write that people will go to where people are going to be heat?
Do you don't have any for?"
Sustomers, you know, you know,
And of course, that would be very much that would be remembered that I was runm 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I was write I wanted to be write that I wanted to be write 20 years ago.
People said, "Don't you never get success?
Don't you get to wise, that you will go through it.
Don't you afraise that your life on this work without that there ever be something from broken and you will strong your broken out of your broken dreams with your bitters of fail?"
Something in that stream of the stread.
In the short comes to the short questions of this questions, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called these things being
Always of it.
But I'm also for a lot of other things that are all of different things that all of it.
For seeing seeing things and other engineering things.
But what is write write to myself the last time that come few from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically that somebody is eight afraid to be the work for the work for the work for their human on Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of it on the effects of it in the ministic put something like that.
Some now my father. He was croshift in the 40 years that he was working in 40 years that he was working in 40 years that he was wondered to him or he didn't remember, he didn't remember.
And that's how do it "John, how is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, so there was not a bit about it.
To be fair to be engineers have been engineers by they've got to reputation to be able to be the reputation of manical-depressed.
Schrician, which have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental engineering human beings are instability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be instability.
Look at the grim of the grimming of the most magnificant creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often young, often by own own own own own through own own own through own own through own own own through own own own through own own own own through own own own through own it.
And even those of those who are not suicide of suicide to be able to be controlly.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer's a piece of myself depended up to myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of speaking out, we don't look at it.
We all have a honor, and we heard it all before all accepted it.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity unlocks to suffering that an artist, and that a artist, and that a artist,
And that's why I want to ask everybody here today, can you with that idea life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I'm going to think about that, I think about it, I don't think about the right now.
I think of the reason I think of the reason
And also angerous.
I won't see that this century this century is that this century.
We can creative mind to live sports a lot of better.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous life would be dark to those dark to those dark thought.
Second the fase where my career now is now.
Go only after, I'm young, amper safe years.
I can may be working four decades.
Hunclearly will be anything I'll publish everything that I'm going to get seen now that extraordinary succcessful book.
We are here with friends of this, so I can classed you in a class: high probably light my greatest success,
Jem, what a idea !
If you go and think, you know, you know, you're going to be nine in the morning to the next hours to the next hours to the next hours to the next hours to be nine in the morning to you, and you know the morning to the neine hours to you, and you know it down the morning to the drope hours to you know the wink hours to the
So I want to do that.
I like this.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after long after the conclusion I can only go through a psychological protection in the process of the process in process in the process of the process of inside the process of inside the process of the process of the process that I can only get a psychological protection in the process of the process that I can only through
I have to go on the write a safe distance between myself and my overbody between me, and my over, understand my controlling publishing to my future publications.
I have looked at the last year, I looked at ways to ways do that.
I have in the history and I failed me in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to see creative people to help creative to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been bird to me with the old Great and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Great and Romeins believed that creativity was not that creativity of themselves.
Men believed that creativity was a good mind mind of a windo, unknowledge place to human unknowledge and unknowledles.
The Great named these baiths of creativity "demonstrate."
And Socrations believed he was a demon that he had a demp of him who influence words influence
The Romeins had a kind of a kind of idea.
And in the himself-in-decided creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their policy was a kind of magic entities that was a magigic entities that are opposed in the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the household of the house.
And if the artists was work on the genius.
And he gave shape he shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work --
The artists was taken so in the artists for example, a lot of narcism.
If you work billiant was not all the early one.
Everybody knew that was a unvisible geniused to hold your heads.
Well, you know, you work out of you, you know, it doesn't just you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inpendent.
Long time that the West, the time in the West, creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed it.
There's a very new idea of new idea: the individual human point of the universe, and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godness,
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came to constantly
And for the first time in history was about artists artists said that they were a geniused to be a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I fine.
To one person, one person, one person, one in the individual, that he or she was the field of the century, the source of the century mystery, of everything that is goods, creative and the known for a fragift of the fragift of a fragift of fragift human psyche.
As you ask someone ask the Sun,
Egos are blowing up to gigantions and there are incredible incredible high experienced to experience.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists have made a lot of artists made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think that is, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back into an older the relationship between the relationship between the ments and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Well we can do 500 years rational rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the room.
Probably probably people who have tributed the scientific doubt doubt of the idea that elphysics of the idea of course to inspirate of artist to inspiration to inspiring highs to inspirate hights of high teads to inspiration.
It doesn't seem to be able to get you all get to you.
I wonder the question I wonder it.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that would we have thought that thought to be next?
The same as much as a lot of well, as all the other explanations of the totally made uncellability that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have something has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, in fact, you know, that the creative process -- you know, that the creative process --
And that sometimes it can call paranoral.
I have a recently decided of the American directional Ruth Stone meet.
She is in the nine. Her whole life write life them.
She told me about her childhood on the country of Virginia.
Somes, if she was on the work of work was work, they felt a poem on the country.
It was, so said so, that they said, "Well, there was a great way.
So'll be poem gold about the land to her her on the land to her it.
She felt that the ground under her feed under her feel and knew that her on that moment but one thing to do is going to state a little bit of her life.
And she runned home, back through the poem and she had to see the paper and showing and paper.
When the close was her to her her hold was that her only her only chance to write it.
Sometimes she was not enough.
Then ring and ring run, but the house is not.
And in the moments of moments the close by her her hus, looking for her -- in her words -- in her words -- to another close -- to another closer --
And there were also going to do -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost might be a mistake.
And then she was looking for home and paper, and paper, the poems through her it.
Juist that moment she had a pot-clected.
And with her other hand, so told me she poeically poems the poem from the air.
She picked up with his tail and put it back into her body, while she wrote the written back in her body.
In those cases came the poem well-came into paper and paper and then it came up and then in the area thing.
When I heard that I think -- what I thought, I would like to be my creative process --
And so my creative process of my creative process of medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a music, who are every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans it down blood, sweating and trans through it down to work on the same time.
But even in that day quarter, I have been a way that I had a experience.
You can also know the myself as well, that feel that creative ideas in your cross related from a source that you can can identify impossible.
What is that before?
How can we use the way to use the without we become in?
One way that we have good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think is musicians
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the this.
And in fact, a is a great part of his life has been a part of the amazing of the aware of the amazing artists that try to get grip on the units of the unity.
Well, with the 1990s was Tom some resistant to the years.
And on a day he reflected in Los Angeles, and changed it changed it in radical.
And as he was there to be so represented a cragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that is daround ungroup of understanding of the course.
It was a beautiful gone and he wanted to show the hold the hold.
But that went doesn't be that.
He had no paper, not a paper, no paper running right.
The amazing exciting exciting excited the melody of him, "I rerecommendled to me, and then it turns me the melody backwards me to be hone.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't reflect in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the govern, you can't see behind the go?"
"Do you really want to write a song of you can re-write a song of song?
And if you really want to get this song -- you have to be later, you have to classed away if I have time for you.
Now, not, somebody else did somebody else.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment in the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the same understanding dark one.
But the main the case excited the creative process in him called the creative process of geniused to the engine.
The genion was close to the skin, and lived only close to the skin.
And to realized that there was no reason to go through through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizard together to be a wonderful conversation between Tom and own the own aspect that was not quite a failed of Tom himself was a wonderfull of Tom himself was a wonderfull
That story has changed.
I've been a fairly professed of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Bible.
And at a given moment I am in despair.
You know that well, you want to work -- you know, you don't want to be a terrible disastance.
Not soment, really horrible bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
I wanted to go out the whole project all the project
And then I remembered Tom those who wish her to his genius, and I decided to be a power to way.
I wish me of my manuscript and I was a legal criple cample of the room of the room
And I said hard-hard; we know all this, we know everybody is not just through me, that is not only through me.
You can see that I'm in the stop in me.
More I can't give me.
And if you find that it have to come better your thing to do you get your this.
Stook you not, right? Do you don't have a jam.
I just write down through because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular is going to be a lot of office are hearing on ooffice is a difference."
And I jam -- United the here --
Euws came back in the North African desert African desert people to crazy to dance in the sact music.
One and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always amazing, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very smally, very far -- there was something like this.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean to do with that, you know, you have ever seen anything about a performer.
It was like the time stated and the dance the dance stape by a passing step.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights and now everythousands of nights together.
And he was not a longer crazy he didn't just a human being.
In him, under him, under him, failed it.
A fairly fired hourthrough him.
If something like this, if we were going to do something that was going to start clapping them and crope in call, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because that was for them.
By the Moren South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South
The question is the centuried by the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other."
And that hear you hear today the day of the day and flamengodances.
If a piece of artist in Spanine something impossible, "Allah, OK, ole off, "Allah, old one, Allah, broad."
And, understand see: a glimpse of God.
Privers what we need to do it.
Last, the last real is that the next morning to the next morning that he discovered on dincluded not have a good law hours in the morning law is not a good law more direction.
And at that moment is he again, a little bit of the moment with pains that may be never to such a high-high-hights will come to be going to come again.
Maybe never going to be anyone God anyone God anything else to be dance.
What to do he now to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to conference a creative mind.
But so painful need to be the point of it.
And imagine not that the most unusual aspects of your person aspects of your person to yourself.
And imagine you believe that you have a whiled of a time, she didn't care about a bit of specificate of not nather source.
When you ready there with somebody else -- they get to somebody else.
And that's what shares --
I handed incentives that I thought to it.
The last months I have worked on a book that inside that will be able to get into a book, which is going to get a lot of where many reach reach reach and long
The upon that illusts of that illust.
If my thoughts to me the hold me with me the same for, I don't stop the same for, and they don't don't know any to it.
Don't just your work.
You just just like your this, what it is.
If you came to dance is to go through thank you.
If the good genius that you is to decision to leave in your work on enious moment done of the wonderful source, "Ole lean, "Ole lean, "Ole lean, "Ole lean, "Ol.
And you don't happens, then, thance but thance through it.
And also say, "Ole no!"
I believe that I believe hearty.
"Ole any!" anyway, because we pure human love and owness wisdom by staying plooting plooon.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovered, and the discover.
We actually started to go from a new point of point we were the biology to the digital code, and now we're trying to try to go from that digital code to a new fase in biology with designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is something I think about what have tried to understand what have tried to understand on different levels in different level.
We tried different approaches that we tried to minimum components.
We're now going to be the digitalized for the digitalization.
And when we have sequence, it was the human genome ced, it went from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask for a question: do we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory laboratory in a laboratorious organism.
And we tried to look at whether we can come up to a nonce smaller genome.
We can go into the order of hundred genes from the 500 or soon,
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simple to the metabolically with the unction.
Believe me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at the piece of the genes we can probably read that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell cell that would be able to reduced a life would be able to read and look at the cell that we can produce ple per piece, it's very unlikely to look at the genes of looking at the genes of look at the gen
We decided that the only route prevalue was that the only route synthetic so we could deployed the components to synthetic questions, to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started questions, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic -- "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we started to
And the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never see.
And, if we can do that, a chromosope ""
And a chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemical iners.
So, our temple, our temple, accelerate life is accelerated on exponential writical whed.
Our power to write the genetic coded to write the genome of lowly, but is taken away to reflect the genome.
And our last point would be the moment would places on an exponential curve.
We are started here over 15 years ago.
There were a couple of city, to start with a bio-ethic toring toring toring to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be a very difficult.
There are 10 of thousands of machines in the world that little DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so longer you piece of it.
So we had to do a new method for the collect of these little pieces of these little pieces of all the phors of all the phorms.
And this was our first purpogall, starting with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria dead.
We designed the pieces, did the foutcorrection ...
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part we piece in the bacteria stop, and the bacteria piece of genetic code the genetic code and make viral particles,
The viral particles were sold to the cells, they were cells, they came back after that, and deep the E. coli.
I was until I was until with the oil industry, and I said they were model but it was too good snaps.
They laughts more than you.
And we think this is why we think this is a situation where the software heard within a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassetts, so we could decided to the size of viruses, so we could caps the cassettttes ...
And to go to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is critical information in the computer than that has to be digital information in computer than that digital information are very accurame.
And when we first put this genome was the first time in 1995 was the standard of the standard per 10,000 baseparation.
And finally, we found after we found after 30 follows -- if we had the original sequence used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start it.
In fact, in the design is the design is the design of the design that have to read over 50 letters of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build 50 letters we need to design them.
We designing here unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read to stop there water notices.
And think, we have a celletter genetic code: A, C, God and T.
Trios of those letters of letters for running 20 aminozers -- that there is a reflettery clear,
So we can use the genetic code to write words on write words on writing words
And we only called ""The course, "only might be me.
Some of those were calls were calling that there were no poems were cally.
We have designed these pieces of course,
There are enzymes they repay and they put in each other.
And we started making pieces of course, start with pieces that were long long, and you have a piece of 24,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, until 72000000.
In every stage in any together we could sequence a flow of these pieces so we could sequence a process because we want create a process that we could sequences a very robust -- that's going to see that you're going to be able to sequence them.
We try to reach the point of automated automated
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we get to the really great piece of the great pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow them so easy more in E. coli.
And that represents the expensive tools of the modern tools.
And we went to rade with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination called "homology to repain biology to repay DNA to repay and reparts,
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million rad rad to raise anyway.
And you see that in the top of the panel, "chromosome, just a chromosome, just from each other.
12 later, he put it back on the back of the way that was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely have been been completely
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can find out of space, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has married of the way, there's a lot of of here,
Here's a real micropphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact, with these processes -- actually only yesterday mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did.
Gist makes that they automatically saying.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a great molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it
This is photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we includes indeed.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The moleculeculeculecule.
If we would press the way to be pressed with a 10-points letter, there is 142 pages -- there is 142 pages only to press the genetic code away.
Good, how do we started a chromosom? How do we cractivate?
Well, with a virus is the clearly easy.
Well, with a bacteria is the more complicated.
It's also simple, if you put under eukaryots, like us, you just whether you whether you just walk the cell of it, and that's what you know if it's clong.
In the bacterial species is the chromosome, the chromosome, but we have long one, but we have a completely transplant transplant to a chromosal transplant to another, and can activate a different, and can activate the active.
We have a chromosome. We have a chrobsing microbs of a microbsing species.
These are about so far as far as people and mously affect as people and mously mouth.
We figured some extra genes so that we could take this chromosome.
We have the reasonably with enzymes to make all the proteins of the protect piece.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell, and you will be avanced the very avanced graphical images can value -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he was only to get the process of it, but we try to develop the process of developing what further to develop it.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosed a second chromosed or a third somewhere they were thousands of properties that they were thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who have been representation, as if there is one of the agence, they have not changed a lot of biology have been reportunated a lot of biology that are powering again.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that actually take DNA real real.
The chromosome, that in the cell was not one.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put it in it -- well,
It was expresses that and the other chromosome of chromosome, and it was the other chromosome, and therefore it was going to finally and therefore we had to finally take the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was stopped in it,
And in a very short time away, all the characteristics of the one species, and changed it into the new species, and he changed on the new species, and he had been stoped in the new software that we had in the cell software that we had stop.
All the egggated the membrans -- when we read the genetic code -- when we read the genetic code was changed.
This is going to be like genomically as a genomical chemist, but we're in state, by change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Good, I have a based before that this is not a creation -- this is a break based on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have become a new version of the Camble of the Camble of the Camble explosion of the Camble of new species where there are major scale new species of scale and based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's prettty clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to go into the six-and-half to 9ine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets,
for each of us that lived in 1940, in 40 years,
We have a food, with food, with the conversation of clean water, medicine for the six-and-a-half billion.
That is that being took to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, over 30 billion collabor.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the more, or whether what process than any perceived that to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then there is of course, all the carbon dioxide of the stor that comes back into the atmosphere
And all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had a dozero, but a dozero-bycle, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that was coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that was coming out of the diversity that was coming in the diversity that had been there.
We are constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have technique to do technique synthese, and we have this called combination genomics.
We have the ability to build a great robot that can make a great robot that can make a million chrobot can make a day.
If you go on the work of 20 million different genes or trying to optimmize processes to produce octan, we can produce to produce octan, we can change a little vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in science, we can do more molecular biology than in science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design is what real design software where we work on the point of the computer can design and a new species on the computer.
We don't know person how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code of it.
We now on the fourth generation generation generation generation --
And you have seen your ground to ethanol ethanol of the experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come into the fuels that will come out of the fuels like sugar, until fuels like sugar, or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price higher and making availability to reduce the availability to get CO2 as his food, and that's why we cells that we can design the first food, and we think we are the first fired generation generation -- and we think we are the first generation generation generation to fuel burness.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered the global discovered all kinds of other methods of other methods of methods of other methods.
This is a organism that we described in 196.
It lives in the depended about 2.5 miles deep, cooking hot solives in the same showing heaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way if we can take CO2 we can be take celelelelements can be fability to factories where that CO2 is being back to fuel this process.
So in a short of time, we think we are in a short of breads on the basic question: "What is liv?"
We actually have a real, you know, we have the purpose to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where there are wonder that?
A important energy source becomes
But we also work on the using of these tools to make these quickly series of vaccines to think
This year, there was the flu was the flu ong as it comes to the right now when it comes up on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change from the combine of combine vaccines.
Here's how the future can see the future of the evolutional tree now is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria, archaea,
We are more removed of humans.
Our goal is certainly to do a chance that we make a chance to survive long enough to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be a long enough to do that may be a long enough to survive that we may a long enough to survive that maybe a long enough to survive that we have a chance to do that
What I want to show you to show you is the fundamental we have a new technology that we have to a new technology that we are about a year ago.
And it's a sense of environment, or in the state of the amounts of visual data can work data can work data can work data can work data can work of visual data can work or in the distance of failed with immense amount of visual data can work of fire.
We look at this here many gigabytes and can be able to keep here and can stay in the right inciple and out, and example, and then the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of terms
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how large these collections or images are or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small show of the Library or Congress, and it's in the 300 megapion,
It all down nothing from because the only thing that would be exactly influence, on a most, the amount of pixelless the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graum by Dickens. Every capital to Dickens.
To point to point that it's really affect to show you something like this, we can show something like this really text is really avery, to show that this is not a imagine.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange of a bunch of book.
I won't couldn't reach it.
This is a realistically example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper on a whether whether whether it's a scale medium.
We also have something with the corner of this expensive of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertisising advertisising -- a lot of higher resolution -- and we have extra normal advertisising extra information information
If you want to see the opportunities of this car seeing car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make the concerned that we can really make the limitations of handles.
We hope that this is not a pop-hope and other other other thing that would be needed to be more and other other other other thing will be needs -- not going to be more of it.
Of course, a country to hand made a technology like this, I wonder to a technology like this, I won't spent time to this field -- except that we can contributed this field --
This is all the roads in the U.S.
And on top of a picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques to each other.
One of them is Seiting and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snavely, promote on the University of Washington, meaning by Steve Seits on Steve Seits on Steve Steve Seits on Steve Seits on the U.W.
And Rick Smiricrosoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, when we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the space of the images of the images of here,
The computer vision algorithms have been brained with the real space -- the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of elements of stabilized diashws of stabilized diashws or panorama ples of these, and all these things are space are space all these things are space all these things are space counts.
I don't know sure or there is, there is another environments.
There are a lot of space --
I want to like to be a Noah's spoke of a data sets -- and this is from a question -- and this is from Photosynth of Photosynth we were working in this summer -- to the communicate what I have in my head in my head in my head of the real power of these technique, in the purpose of these technique,
We had to do with the advocate and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, Dame, with images of Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get imagine in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the c
And each of these orange chains gives a picture of this model in this model of model.
And so this is all Flickr pickr pictures, which are in this way room in this way space way --
And we can corporate on simple wise navigate.
You know, I had never thought I had ever thought I would be at Microsoft would work
It's conversation to be so did to be so critical here.
I believe you can see that these many typice of cameras, everything from the mirroras, a great number of them, a great number of them.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much more covered by faces, and the things like this.
Somewhere between this, even a series of photos --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dalso that Dame also goodged by the program.
If we put it into the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things with social environment. This uses now the data of all collective memory -- of the other, the objects of horrow -- and buy that everything to elk on each other.
All these photos with each other with each other and shapes together than the same thing greater than the share of the parts.
You have a model that from the Earth of the Earth is state.
And this is like a considered on Stephen Lawler's work on Stphen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it used to use, and also which the benefit of the benefit of the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being metaphor.
If someone would like someone would like to attack and their names, and their names, my picture of the Notre Dame, my picture Dadid with all those data, and I can use that metaph, used to use that metaph, used of everybody else to do anyone, and create some kind of course, and create some kind of cross-modal, and create sus-modal, and create experience.
And of course, the ax-product of this immense rich model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from airl, who don't just from airl, satellite images and other passocial pictures is difficult memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I undersoftware possible, in the next years, all the images that can make a day, all of the images that can be part by everybody on the world can crace on the world can cratch a world together?
BAAAAAA: Yes. What this really doesn't do it.
The create to your wish, hyperfective between imagins.
And the data in the data in the imaginations.
And that designed when you think about the riching when you think about the richdom of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look for the web looks for the web and you look for a search in the web page of the web page page of the webpage of the webpage of what the image is going to do the image of the imagination of the picture.
What if now that is the image of your imagination?
Then the number of the number of the understanding of the amount of right that comes from that continue to giant gigantic. It's a classical networkfect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible.
One of the intense pleasure and of eating eating eat, the ability to live between them, the ancient window that are the old wind the old wind of the wind, the reason wind the wind, the profitters of reflect in bitters of bitters of the plants, the profound bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still revies, or that the Melkay, or the myths of Inuite to the myths of Inuitar, or that in the Himalaya break of the Dharma, or that in the Himalaya bread, remember reminds of the Dharma, reminds of the anthropology is not in a absolute constribute in a absolute of the absolute of the world is not in a absolute of the world --
the consequence choices of a set of course, which made our ancestors made ago.
And of course, we all share the same adapty adaptance, Words born kids in the world.
We all make inference rites.
And with the inconnect with the death.
So it can't be surprised that we were all sings, dances and art art and art
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is going to be the Penan in the Borneo, or the Voo-acoly in Hain, or the stridge of the Saisut-born in North Kaisut-burned in North Kenya, the Caravantage of Caravantage in the Shhara. -- this is the man with whose of the desert of the deserious month, a money -- or now some month, or now some money in the holangma,
Everest, the godin the world.
They all learn us to be differently, differently, differently.
If you think about it, you can only give you a bit of hope.
And they shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her as important as the biological life web -- the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine your presentation.
The eath of the eath of the cornal minds if the totally of all the number of all the craces, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, myself-inspirations that are inspirations of our consciousness.
The eath is the great nalatence.
And she's the symbol of all that we can be and all that we can be amazing news astonishing curious animals.
And like the biosphere is the eating face is the eath of the crophere is that crope mate.
No biologist would be continue that least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of the point of all kinds of way.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario comes doesn't even come up in the neighborhood, and the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of the language.
And then everybody here was born born born was sixed sixth of the Earth --
A language is more than her words or her grammatic regular regular regular regular regular regular regular regular basics.
A language is a classocation of human sould.
It's the ference of value that the soul of any unique culture, the material world
Every language is a centuried mind of mind a distinction, a crace, a ecosystem of spiritual opportunity.
And from that sixth of sixed today today the day half of the day of that don't have kids flistening flistening in the day.
They are not longer again.
Effective means that, unless a change of change, that they were dead.
Is there something camers to be surface by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, not have the wisdom of the wisdom or the wisdom of the reflect or the real reported to see the children to see the children to see the children to see it?
Pective that terrified to be somebody's leaving any two weeks and every two weeks and with him the last letter-hand-letter-failed language.
Some of you say, "Well, the world wouldn't be better place if we all are the same language of the same language of the world? I say, "Suba naes. Or Kantonee.
Or Kogi.' "You realize your own language, you will realize language.
So what I want to do to do is going to take your munice on a short journey, which has to be sketched a picture of what is going to have a picture of what is going to do is going to be lost to be lost to be a short of what I want to take you today to do today in a short of what I want to do to skeep today is going to take you today to take you to
Many of us forget that when I'm talking about another way of around "another way of are, I also really mean, I also mean.
For example, this Barasana child in the North Amazon the anaconda, the people who believe that they were from the anaconda, that believes that the melk of the window in the sacre, in the sacre, in the sacross of sacred snaded sness.
This is a full that cognitive the colors blue and green not green understanding the skulls of the sacred of the office of the ower is equal depending on the off.
They have a called language, which is the linguistic example, which is the linguistic example, someone who is called someone who speak a different language.
This is a mythological past, but the extraordinary full in their houses, where six or seven talks and save talks to a language or seven talk, but you never heard anyone of language.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinerend-based strain, the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a bluefully in 1958 fewing contact was contact of contact was contact
In 1957 tried to five missionaries contact and explain, but they made a critical fal.
And the air stream photos of themselves with using to us idea of view of themselves that they were never seen a two-dimensional.
They went the photographs and tried the shape the face behind the face.
And when they couldn't found that the duniverse that the duniverse of them ries, and after the missionaries are spears with spears were spears.
But the Waorani doesn't only extracts, but also there.
Fift-five percent of their mortality came from through thanks
We could generalogies to eight generations back to eight generations that we could take two of a natural death --
And when we went through them, they gave that one man ever died that one man ever died from old to any age, but in the same time he was being the same amazing the same time they had a amazing knowledge of the owne knowledge of the own.
Their jagers could go on 40 passes could go back and tell the whole animals,
Begin 1980s, I got a bit of the based remains when my professor me me me asked me to Haiti to Haiti wanted to go to Haiti genome was going to infilled the basis of president Duvaler Duvaler of president Duvaler as also the power of the power of the power of the made of the made of the made of the made of the world that are made.
And to these sensational things about understand what can understand what to understand something about this particularly believe, which is not a cult of black --
It's a complex metaphysical world's image, very interesting.
Would I ask you the big world's religions, what would you say that?
Christian, islam, islam, boodhism, etc.
One continent is always to be money from the attack that Africa was the Sahara no religious believed the Sahara had no religious believed this well.
For is simply simply the destillas of this deployed religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during diaspora diasportunately diasportunately.
What fairly the lives is the lived in life and killed the lives and killed the lives and killed the life and killed the life and killed the life is the life and killes.
The lives bars of mind the mind.
The minds can be representation of the Great Water, answer the dance ritme that the soul of the life that the soul of the life is going to be moving the soul of the life that has become the follow.
And that's why they say fairly fair: "You are going to thank about God.

I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convinced the psychard the psychard that was discovered by his discovered by his discovered by his 1930s.
I mean that these tryptased that these tryptamines are not to identify as hallucinated because when the effect is that there are no one more effect to experience. Tryptamines are not oral order to experience. Tryptamines are not order to be a single in the human darmous darmous oxial.
They can only be oral organized to something that the monoamine of something that the samine of you effect mean.

This picture I have on the northern of Baffin Island genomes, when I went with Inuits on narrow hunt with Inuitve.
This man, Olayum, Olayum, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Iner. In the 1950s, they were going to be our souldn't always to say, in the corned in the 150s.
The opa of Olayuk weigned to go.
The family of handled for his life, and decided him him all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Infrom the coll; they made the coll; they made it used to us.
The gline icyard of their bases were made from their purposes of fish in charibood.
Olayuke was not afraid for the page, or the storm that walked up.
He went out, he like, he showed his brows and put in his hands. And then the poot in his hands. And then he was a free in the corned as a lemme.
He brought a lot of lawing salk on the side of the momen's moment.
And when it was solid a dog me.
He did the dog, and improvised a hearnas.
And from the ribs of the ribs made a bast.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood, and he disappeared on the ice fault and pooms.
And, with nothing around and this, and this, in many symbol for the weather of the weather of the Infrom the Infrom the Inview of the Inview.
In 1999 gave the Canadian government government from the Infrom the entire country greater than California and Texas Texas well, it's called Nunavue.
It's independent area. They remove all the groundary destoff.
It's a conference example of how a nationse enough,
And finally, I think it's clearly the clearly thing to this home to this home to these home to this is not really far away away again.

where all the wisdom of all the people can contribute to us being section to us.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some questions, I want to talk about some of the book,
Maybe you see, you may see information from other sources.
And I also try to explain some of the moment.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Western separated society.
And that official dogma distrible of the skin the wonderful of our citizens on the highest level, we need to have to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good, a great case part of the human existence.
And the too stell that is freedom, to act a handled myself, to reach a higher wonderful speak without inments.
The ultimate freedom we find choice.
More choices like that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, more freedomic wonderful more wonderful.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be droped to drope down to a drope that nobody would be droped in our society.
And in our life is this dogma bit of affairma celebrated.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. It's a mean.
Story about thressings.
And too that 175 cant-hand-dressings are in my supermarket, there are in my supermarket, extra-virgins and 20 walking amicos and 20 walks.
And that you can make a number of the number of the dressings, for the case of you nothing between 175 species for you.
So that's the privation of my supermarket.
Look at electronics. You can go into electronics. You can state your stereoset of your stereoset of -- air speakers, cassettespecially diverstereos.
And the one electronics and you can choose out of this attacross this attacy.
You can see six and a half million different systems with share with parts of that story.
Give too -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
And when I was young ago, long ago, you could call your calls to wonder the phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You can't be able to get the state. You can't bought it.
And that had the fairly continue that the continue to be never piece of it.
That time.
And now there are a lot of different state.
And for the cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mid-3--fleter, and cryme-ber and crise crymember,
Well you have this model in the wink, but you can make sure that that that that happens that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question?
No.
It's not possible, a moble that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the points of spulls, is this explosive of choices is this explosive inside a fet.
Sune health care -- it's in the United States not so that you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what you should do should do is,
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do that, we can do it.
A has this formade and nadelivered this form and
And what do you want to do you to do?"
And you say, "Doke, what is what is do?"
And the doctor, "As this offence, and nadelicians this formade and nadelivers.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do says, if you was me if you was you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not."
And we call ""own inbring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, which is the heavy shift of decision of someone of the bases -- to a certain a certain disease, someone who has a free and not the best condition to decisions. The patient. For on recipates -- the patient to recept decisions.
Good considered that ners, because the purpose group, because the purpose.
Why do we make advertises, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity, yet a bit of aspect of us existence, is now considered to see.
Our identity is to reflect our background
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to only ourselves.
Every chard to the concerned to be what to be you want to be thinking what you want to be able to be thinking what you want to be like to be there.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that free that free everybody was going to be able from that you can possible, and then then you can possible, and then we can started to children started to children started to children started to children started to children started to children and then we can get out of
The only real choice was whether and what you do and what you do is not when and what you did did.
Now, you have free everything for the opening for it.
I give lesson of particularly intelligent students, which I mean, I wonder than asked less house,
They are not dom, or like, or like, or like,
No, they have drug with choices with choices.
"Well, I say or no? Sreshould I no?
Or I will I wait to wait? I first could?
These are all being questions.
They go through to them, also they are going to have a answer that they don't get their house work and there, and there are no good cumber half.
And they have right. It's important life.
And we come up with work. Carl gave just that technology is to work. Carl takes us to work on every minute of every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a married place, which I like WiFi For does.
I don't fair, because I want to love that place for myself.
But good, that huge choice of work like that we wonder us to work on our crossing whether we're going to work, or now we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a footbalwire of our son the san, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all out of state, you know, you are we all all the minute of those We're asying, "Well, I ask this is what about is, "Well, you know, should I remember?
And if I write on this emailt breager?
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience the footbalwed of our son a very different way.
And what we also look at it, the large, the group, materialistic bags, life is a question of life is a question of question of this.
And so the world looked like this.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of question of it.
And shows the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad --
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we are good to is, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very hone-effect is that the first lamong leaves works than completely than completely
And with so many choice possibilities people to make a choice to make a choice
I give you a very dramatic example of the investiguous example of investiguous planns.
A colleg of me got to investment to investment data of Vanguard, a great policy society with about one million society with about one million works,
And they discovered that for every 10 percent of the work-policy that worked the part of the particular two percent of the particularly two percent of it.
Can you know, fifth of five percent less works, less works, with five fundres?
Because it's fifth of fifth is so difficult to choice that people are just experienced to the next day, and that went to the next day, and so forth.
And of the expensive comes back to the same thing.
And that means not only that people after their pensioned after their pensioned because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money and they did the choice that they were knowledge the characters of them.
And they were going to love to the 5,000 dollars a year,
The worker was called the worker was craft to double.
So the number of choice can work on a lot of choice
And I think the world of that the world is looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to get the right choice makes the right choice makes right?
You don't want to be capacross the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did the lamely of us wouldn't choose and choose eventually less tevel less tevel than the result of the result of if we had less options less options as we had less options before.
There are more reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, reason reason reasons, back that the choice was not perfect perfect was perfect perfect of that.
You put your in such a case for that another choice would be better better.
This is dreamed alternative alternative to be gonto your choice.
And speaks to the choice of the choice that you have made that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice.
The more options there are easier to have the easier to have the way to have speak of unclean,
Second of doing a bstitution.
And then Gilbert from morning about how often we are all the value of things we are living things that we are compared them to compared them to compared them to compared them.
If you can in, you can see a lot of alternatives, you can see all the attractive cants of all the alternatives of all alternatives you went down.
And that makes you that less tevach the alternative that you have choses.
One example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a bit of the stretched of this example.
This is a strap in Hamptons.
They have a wound.
They are on a wonderful strand. Straling again. Straling again.
Do can't be anyth? "Ferdikic," thinks that man, "It's augengineer.
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is the city --
I could flash my car for the door."
And he sit here two weeks to simpl, with the idea that he was a great parking again,
Substitution, and the cost of the entivation that we have from our choice of our choice we make a great choice choice.
The more opportunities are more appreciate alternatives are more of the alternatives there.
And those presents us as a substitution.
Another example.
This pictured of a couple of points.
For example, for example, and that you should not govern,
And one point is that you have a different choices excluded of any choices
And all that other has been so his office that the gecks that the gecks option less attractives.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this, I came looked at a new brow.
I almost always spired always brow.
Because there was only one kind of the browd, and that browed your dance. It was not going to be the page, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the browing and often enough the room OK.
And I went to the wink to the wink for a new thing.
And I said, "Dag, I want to get a director, this is my mee."
And the mall, "Wilt you called smart or relaxed to fit --
Do you know whether a rit? Wilt you stone-was?
Do you have a browed with sin-effect?
You know, you know, the way to be walking out of the roop, or flying pipan." And so he went down."
I was there and I was a little bit of time, I said, "I want to say, "I want to go out and say, "I want to go and say, "I want to walk out of it.
He had no idea what broed, and so I got a long brows long all the possible brows pass.
And I mean, I mean, I left the wink on a browing brow.
I had better every better of those opportunities I could do it.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To do this to myself, I wrote a book.
The reason I don't feel better of all that choice, was that I started to expect more expect of the sness of a good speeak of a good display broek.
I started without any expection, because I just killed one kind of knowledge.
And then it turned that there were different and one of that, and one of that would be perfectly be able to be perfects.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think my browed my browing expectations, and that picked me me to do it.
The more opportunities people have more opportunities of those corations about the deservices of those opportunities.
And that means people are less tevactives, even if the good results are even if the good results are good results --
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case I don't know where I'm talking about now.
In really going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was surprising was surprising experiences have surprising experiences.
In our modern society can we reach citizens can reach citizens -- but the best thing we can reach is expected is that something so good is good as we had ever expected it.
And we are surprising to be surprise, because our expections, my expectations, torents.
The secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness.
I want to get here -- I want to get here, a carry biographically elemental -- that I was with a woman who really faile.
I didn't have her with less tevaced with less teving.
But with less enough less enough his good cans.
And finally, you to get a bad bad bad bad bad brown brows and one kind of presents as there is one kind of presentation, you can wonder why you're unteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible to you. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brows are available to fall, and you buy to fall the time, who is responsible against answer?
The answer to that, it's just as simple.
You had a better choice to make a better choice.
Well, with hundreds of different brows have no excus.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions, they are put of those decisions, they are put on their choice.
And they take themselves --
In the Western society of clinical depression under the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive too and self-moor, is that people have so often television and self-moor, is that people have been so often tell their high experience.
And if they try to explain that themselves try to explain, they give themselves the wall.
So the ntoresult is that we have objective, but our objective, but our bad bad of this.
And for a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where is being taken to where is taken up to where is taken
But that's not.
It doesn't like that, you can't choose better than not choice can't choose follows that is more choically better.
There's a magic boundary choice possibilities.
But I know that we already long for the point that choice is that walking us well.
Now, there is a principle -- I'm almost crope -- a principle where we can like the best of the best of us to do the best of the best of us to do the best of the best of it.
The choice in industrialized countries come from material overfish material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about heard earlier is too much ch, but it's not so much choice that there is too much choice.
So the paradox I was talking about here, so with name for the moder, walking Wests.
That's frustrated and said this, and you say, "Steve Levitt you yesterday and did it was telling and did children -- and did of your money.
I say the same thing about this diout, complicated choices -- they don't help any cros: they crossed to it.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society of these choices were being contributed to where people are living to countries that people are going to be live in the prevent of those people are going to be on it.
And our life would go on the front of this.
That's what economists called a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wells -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of the choice of us with our mean.
And finally, if you read this picture, if you read this picture, you know, if you developed humans say, "Ach, what does you know about that?
Nothing is possible."
A write of a write of global image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the long, I understand that this fish smart is that this fish smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you courage the fish to create possibilities, you don't have freedom, but lost.
If you get the fish to create possibilities, you get less teve.
It leads to more like, and less tevilled teving.
Everyone has a fish of brain,
This is a free certainly certainly -- possible, but for us.
But the discusing of a figured figured to walk to ellers, real, unheilled.
Thank you for your attention.
