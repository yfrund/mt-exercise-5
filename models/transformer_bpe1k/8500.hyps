And I think of this two dia's last year, I see this two dia's pooling the police of the list of the last three million years of the faster of the vaster of the U.S.
But this is the real problem of this particular problem because it didn't the dict of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it didn't have the dicate.
The ice is the North pool is in the certain the capach heart of us heart of our global system.
It looks at the winter and crite in the side and crity.
The next of the next I show I is a version of what the last 25 years,
And the permanency is done in room.
As you see it from souldn't sit out out of darkly.
That's the years, it's the year times the winter.
And it crimp in the six.
And so the mean, or five years, or parenty or parenty or is almost like blood is like blood on the body.
In 25 years, it's the way of this gone to this this.
And that's a problem because the frors of the North IJssea born IJssea very big hundred hundred hundred hundred by the designed by microm in methrough microm in meth.
And the total hundred hundred in the atmosphere, that would be high that high to the same purpoint that we can reality the same punt of the same punt write of the total high-scribe.
In some understand in Alaska borrelated in Alaska borrely on the water.
And Africopen winter Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to a different to a different understand a different understand on a different unediep of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University of the University Walter of Alaska cape of the University W
Whoo! It's OK. The question is wrong.
A reason is that this enormous warms Groenland from the now of the noor.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than the water than ever food.
This is the Kangerlusual refour in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea seespecially because it country to be country to the place where it is the place where it is the place where it is the sea sead.
These stromes.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South pool, invented the big ice is the big ice is on Earth.
And Africopen rically scientists that it help the whole continent now is a negative edity.
And so the ice of the ice is the ice of the South pool is very quickly very quicks, with some of the same times of the same of the South pure of the South pure of the Soutsist.
The whole continent for six meters for six meter, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the two after the two after new years, there are now new years, that a few years ago, that a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population of his dream is the whole of that smell time.
In the Andes, is this glass the bron of three water for this city city to this city of this.
There are now more stromes.
But when they deppearing the dreams it also wind water.
In California, there was a reducation of 40 percent in the snow pack of the Sierra.
It's really the water reservice in the water reserbirics.
And as you could leave the predictions are the predictions of it.
This world's world dreamed dreamed to a dramatical stype of farmer.
And the number of nature, of the whole world is cited with a incredible and never seed.
And in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years, in the past 75 years.
This patterns is completely understandard.
If you look at the way from a historic context of a historic context of here.
In the last year in the last year we have 70 million ton CO2 hours --
25 mios every day in our ocean, Kool, look at the eystic area of the Stille Ocean from America, from America, and from the Indiase of the Indiase of the Indiase of the Indiase of the ocean.
The only thing that the bottop of the Earth, name out of the Earth, which is the burning of the photographs of photograph.
Oil is a problem, and stop is the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest stoters, sames.
And there was a particular more still to build a lot more still centrals.
But we see a ommemb.
These are the citied of the bold that the bold was annuled in the last years, and where big alternations and where larges were alternations and where are alternative alternative were before the bold of the bout.
There is a political stribuilt in our long in our long in our long our long in our long in our long in our country.
The cities, and oly industire industribuilt year, 250 million dollars of a single of a single of promots, which is a text of the same this.
And that mean, I mean, I think about something like this.
Rond the char, in me was in Tennesse, in Tennesse, four billion billion billion billion again.
You have the probably in the news in the news of it.
This is the one after one after one after a largest of the America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertist of the city, the Kerst was the Kerst was the Kerst was deside.
And Video: "Frosty the city's still right, operated a blice, opposed to chal.
He's flow fluence, and he sare here in America, and he sare the economy grow.
Frosty the city, the day is becoming with the day
He's decided and shapes and works, and works, their benefit."
Here is a big comes a big in West Virginia of the city.
The big is the great is the country is the great bigh of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship is "Let me mean, "Let Gore, Nancy Pelsi, Harry Red, Harry Red, they don't know where they don't know about that."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Kliance for Kliance for two campaigning two campaign.
This is a piece of it.
And Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious of the things for our things that we saw our things that we saw our business for our things
That's the reason why the most important thing is to be a gigantly to give a gigantly for the body, and the free of the light and of the truth and the control of the value of value that is the truth of the value of the truth is the important is the important of the
Feity, is not small the same is not smoment.
We think it's a son that it is -- and it's still another lecker of each other.
So, you don't have a climate change.
Let me be down.
Video: Acteur: Schone city.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern cool.
Fantastic! The machines best best we've got a lot of the law.
But that's the soundly sound technology.
And then, the fact that the fact that the burning of the most most important thing of the most important thing that changed the remarkable of the Earth is changes the tremendous technology that you see here.
Look good around this is the schone of the day.
Al Gore: Einded the positive alternative alternative in our economic challenges and that are the area of national security of national sects.
Video: Stem: America very, the economy, the economy, the national seclimate climate climate crisis.
The rod red went to all these things is our dependent of phot phot of phot phot and inmported oil, and inmported oil and inmported oil and inmported oil.
But now is a durful, new solution to get this.
And in the way, America of 100 percent of 100 years.
A plan to get America to get the work to the work on the work and the opened of us and the opportune of the Earth of the Earth generate.
And it was a solution that enough enough enough enough to solve our problems on solve to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last lasse.
Video: Stem: Stem: It's going to give America openergy to give America cle.
And one of the most ways to make a way to make a end of the ppendent of the policy of olded to our planet, five to helping our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then 2: Neously investmental to create good bit of the jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Til to be realist.
Al Gore: There is a old African speakil, "If you want to be yone.
If you want to go to this, ga societ."
We have to go and fast.
Thank you.
And I gave a put I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I was going to come back with a hold about how that machine works.
So here, I again, I don't have been doesn't have the LHC is is the largest scientific experiment experiment in the bignment, 27 miles in the trement.
It need to the entire of the stances that are being less than a billion a billion the universe second to 600 million to 100 million time.
Enorm ambition: thus.
This is the machine under Gen's fair.
We need photographs of that mini-Bangs basin detectors in detectors that I work. It's called the ATLATLAStator -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLAS.
And in 10 september of the machine for the machine for the machine for the first time.
This photograph was genomes by ATLAS.
That is a fact for a fact in the control in the control room room room room
It's a picture of the first particle that helped around the LHC and with the LHC and with the HC and with a piece of the LHC, value in the detector of the LHC, value in the detector of the detector.
And other words, when we see that photograph to 10 September win, what we have work that the machine works, which is a huge of explose is a huge of deplosing that.
I don't know if this the largest of the largest right, or this, or then, or then, and saw the Internetpage, and saw the internetpage.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact that means have made a scientific impact that means have made a scientific impact that means means that means have a scientific impact that means have a scientific impact of a cultural as a scientific impact that meant.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this gold with this gold.
And that are behaviors 13 thousands of thousands when the machine on the entire works.
The engineers using you will say, "Niet that are say "Niet value draw."
They can do that because they can do that because they can be long on whole law.
So at might be a fundred than the space between the gart, that can be drawing that wread through the between the draw.
And in one of the next between the next of thousands in the LHC, zat a construction.
And that was the wrong was something that was being something that was there was a electrical wearing that 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the same this.
This was the result.
This is another indrugs that magneed to be realized that magneed to be about 20 ton weag, and they have about 30 center working about 30 center world and they were about 30 center working on the realization.
We described about 50 magnets.
We mode, what we had to do do.
We all have them all the purpoint of it.
Now they're back on we.
Eind might be the LHC we'll be intact in the LHC we.
We will be true to go and we expect and we expect to you, and we can go to the outside, so we can go to the outside.
Now, of course, that have incredibate that incredibate about the debate of scientific research of scientific research.
And I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so much more than the fact that we are going to be able to be able to the LHC.
And I leave the last words on the English scientist, I mean, and I think of the designs of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so long, he said, "No fair, which is so much of the human before than the human being that our designed in the company of the definitions of the design, and that we are not designing that our designer that we are down, and design, and that we diever designer design, and that we don't have to be designervirond experive experive experive experimentoot of the designed the designed that is so discive experive experive experive experive experiments are experive experive experive experi
Thank you.
And I would want to start to ask with you to ask to your childrend, when you go to your childrenty with blockids.
And then you discovered to understand how you went to understand and and the same pake, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the closing relationships by space relationships relationships relationship,
Rutell you is start to understand because of the world to understand of the world to understand it.
If a information, inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samen with my advision -- samen my advision -- and my medecker Jethi -- what I started to ask me -- what we use as a computer -- what we would use a computer -- what we use a computer mused to a skills that we have a lot of fular entire ineering food in a place that we can front of the popular with a front of the distrial, and that we can have to fick of front of the front of the place that we can figureadvisurequestireshower focke,
And can be ordents, like we want?
This question that we decided that we decided that we decided to see a answer, by the building of Siftable.
Cort samental is a Sifty a interactive computer in the big of a cooks.
They can be found the hand they can be felectly to the felt of the movement and they can free a screen and sources and contact.
And the nuclear is the physical handled to understand that block to understand by understand to understand to understand it.
And Boventables are Siftables a new ecosystem for manipulate of digital information.
And that this hold this hold a more physical difference of their movement and even of their movement and even of the movement and even of the way we have been smodel and even of the way we are different new and live new and leake a little bit of different new and design interactions of the way we have to design a more physical different new new like,
I'll start to some simple example.
This Sift is increated to tell a video to tell a video that you play and others and others and others and others and others and others and others and others s and others and others and others and others and others and others others and others others and others and others and others others and others and otherthern
These interactive portraits are of each other.
And Indies each other, they will be going to each other.
And if they are going to be remarkable to be able to be able to be a little bit and what they can be become to become uwaits to be becoming to be able to be able to be summers and can be able to be summers and can be able to be summers and they can be able to be summers up.
And ferther fellow them and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the using of all of the interaction, as it was a small of a small of a small of the interesting was a flish.
And in this example three Siftables of the examples of the example, and I can use them to use a leave in a leave in a leave in a leave of three Siftables that they are become to to a leave and I can use them to get them to use a lot of three that they are become to use to be using them in a leave of three Sift of the p
And if we have the government, we go back to what back.
There are some cappe cappe of the education, and lots of the education, and logics and logics and logics and logics and logics and logics and logics that we want to show to see things and the result of the entire cormiddle of the education.
Here I was -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci reprogrammmmate.
Here we have a play that a cruising between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in everybody wanted a wanted to get on every Siftable, and few fetable, and few fairly control in a words.
And after 30 seconds it is the recently rescue, and different of a new series of the entire new series of the ice of the entire engineering possibility.
Thank you.
These are some of children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and there is a four of producing and there is a four of make.
They were really really really really really really --
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people almost people have no instructions that people needs need.
All you have to say "Make word" and they know what they need to do do do do do do it.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our young breath, reight?
And it seems to the Siftables that the Siftable.
For him was a blocky blocky blocky of it.
Here is a interactive showing a interactive showed to be show.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learning of language.
This is Felix, this is Felix.
He can be a new characters in the scene of the Siftile with that capter of the table.
Here it it looks like the source.
Video: The sion comes up up here.
David Merrill: No has a tractor in the scene birth.
Video: The orangle.
God though! Yeah!
And though the sup, and it can be the name time, and it can be the came to response the characters of response -- Video: Well,
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open enere.
And he decided how it it down.
Video: The cows fly air.
DM: The last example I will have to show Is a synthesizer and live music and live music instrument that we have developed to developed a sounds, like the lead, and based like the lead, based and drugs and drum.
And every has been a four different variations that you can use to be show you can use it.
These happy in Siftables in Siftables in Siftables that you can get it pals.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern Sifty Sifty of a leave control, as reverse effects and filter.
They're going to be a sound and sound and sound by can.
And ferther the algemental effects like tempo and full that are put on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: Diife with a leave in two Siftable, to a first pattern of the first pattern by a extra extra extra extra lot of extra extra lot of extra lot of extra load of place.
Now, I place the basically ready line
Video: Do I feel a little bit work --
Video: There is I got the filter I was filter to the filter of the drum that I can influence.
Video: I can get it very very, very distances by the opportunity of the tempo blocks.
Video: Th: Don't copple the filter of the filter of expression for what expression.
Video: I can remember, I can reresource the pattern of the play.
So I don't have to plann, but I can't mean, but I can mean, it was very longer and corter lower and corter like I want.
And it was the dimmession of the following Siftile to can.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, from new people, from new people, which is better interfaces that better interfaces that are better and working on the brain and working and working and work and working on the brain.
And today, I had the time to show you one new ement in this designed in this designing with some of a designing possibilities that we are in the lable.
The thought I want to talk about is that this bad is that this bad is that this bad to a very new generation to the interact to the interact to the interact to our breads to our breaks.
And I thank you of hear.
And I look at you to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at it.
I'm writing writing.
And also much more than that, but also much more than that.
My life live long life I'm going to write and I don't think that ever will be change.
And there is unliving in my life is something happened in my life and career and career and career to my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work of work in my life and cared.
And it started to a book that I have unclear to be understanding on a member, "Ety" Bib." And that very smally, very single of the work on the whole work about and international depick and international depick the whole world and international description world and a international descriple of the whole
And the same is that people are always to mean, and always have to be dams and I have to mean.
Well, you know, where -- though you medied.
People coming to me and questions and ask you doesn't have you to me, "Ben you don't have to be event?
And you don't have you to be able to be able to be able to be black to write you're going to be a book that people will be able to be able to be to low to be to los?
And you don't have to be a lot of that?"
Every higustity, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Now, course, that would be very much I was remember I was spread 20 years ago, I was a told -- if I was told to write that I wanted to be a told to write that I wanted to be spread to to become to write that I was remember -- I was very told to be a told that I was going to be a told
People said, "Ben you don't have to be bang that you don't get your never get success?
You don't have to be bang for education, that you don't know that enough to rese,
And you don't have to be your life that you live to this work on this work on that you have to be able to put it out of your broke and you can get your broke bit of your broke bit of fall, and you walking on your broke bitter?"
And anything in that streking.
And in the short of my answer, my answer, "Yes."
Yes, I'm bang for all these things that are become to all these things that are become to all of these things that are become to all of all these things that are become to all of all these things.
Always always all time.
But I'm also much other things that bangly, you don't know that all of all of all of it.
For seeing seeing example, and other engineering things.
But what the last time I ask write I member, I member, I member,
Is it rational e?
Is it way, somebody becoming to be become to the work for the work for the work for the work for the work on Earth on Earth are showing on Earth are set?
And what is so basically that we are so far to creative us to make the effects of the effects of the mindity, something like to work on different species, something about different species.
Now, it was my father. He was society engineer, and I can't remember that there was not remember to ever it was wondered to him for it has not a bang for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for a 40 years of it.
And so of "Yohn, the way is the with your chemblockade?"
Now, so not word not about it.
And in the past be engineering engineers have been through the century of the century of the reputation of stuff for stuff for stuff for stuff for stuff for stuff and them.
And the same kind of reputation.
Not only write another creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of it.
Look at the grimble doing the most most most most magnifical creative every few creative evolved the 20th century.
And many stimag, you know, towards through own own down.
And even even the same that don't have a sources that sweeks, under their gave decided to be sweeks.
In the last interview for his dread said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer's pieces of myself."
And that's all the way to say about your lives of your lives.
But of this kind of looking at this kind of looking at that.
We all have the first one of the same and have heard and have the same with six cepted all of accepted the same accepted and have the same with the same time.
The brain, is that creativity is that creativity unlosing is increatives and that a artist, and that a artist, and that is going to leave to read to the pure of the entist.
And so I want everybody today, everybody today, you can ask with that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of living here,
Do you know that OK?
Now, I think I think about that, I think about about thought I think about thought I don't thought of thought thought of thought thought of thought I thought I thought I don't think about it.
I think it wear the wear.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this ew century.
We can creative better better better better to life.
And I know that the mimagine for me, in my situation, in my situation, to be done would be done thought of the dark of thought of the dark of life.
And there are the fase that my career where my career is in my carer ry in my career value in my career value where my career is now the fair.
And you're still young, amper say, amper say years.
I can be able to be four decade, four decade,
Hoogling is going to be all of the outside of the outside of the outside that is the work on that ballowed on that ballowing on that book.
And we are here with friends on friends on the friend: high-basically light my grandst success, my grandst successary me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it.
So I don't want to do it.
I love me love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work of the work that I love me.
And the question is: "Hoo?"
Now, long after I think I'm going to be coming to write that I can get by write to write a psychological protection in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of the process of the conclusion that I can get a psychological descrips in the conclusion that write of the concl
I have to see the write of a lot of the showing of the write and my government and my government is very understand for the reactions for the reactions of my future publications.
And I have the last year to ways to ways that to do that.
I'm in the history in history and have to depensive medication to see or others or others maybe a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creations that creative complications of creations ination.
My search was braight in the old Gries, and Romein.
Let me so, it's a long and incredid story.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romins and Romin, people don't believe that creativity was not a henough of hends.
And I believed that creativity is a good particular was, which was a good place to the human and unknows and unknow.
The Gries, this next of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And the socrates that he had a demp that he had a demp that was a demight words influence.
The Rominein, a kind of type idea.
And they hand hand she was called a little bit of creative ement.
The follower is that the Romins with a genious of a genious put a bit of charter.
In their policy was a genious of magical entition that are in the mure of the ately of the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house.
If the work on the work way, the genious of the genious of the genious assistence.
And it was the work.
Brilliant! That's precisions I was going to talk about the first again, the psychological depensive the results of your work.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The articular was so in protect of the example.
If you work down there was, you wouldn't know all the ear.
Everybody is that a couly, that a unvisible of genious you have holp.
And you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't have a you.
Everybody is that you have a close genious genious genious genious genious genious genious genious geniously genious genious ence.
Lange time is that the West in the Westen creativity was protected to protected to protect the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the West and creativity was the West of the Westen creativity was protect to protect in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything change.
There is a very new idea: the individual humans is the middle of the universe of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysteriious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and follows and mysterious of the good ideas.
And Go space for mystical we've been stuff from the goddpartly world.
And that was the beginning of the rational houmanism.
People of believe that creativity from the individual,
And for the first time, in the history of articular artists say that they were said that they were not a genious and not enjoy that they had a genious and say that they had a genious and say that they had a genious in the history.
I have to say that I have to find that I think that a great ful.
And one person is one one of a person, one of the engindividual, or she safe that he safeed the bron of the equired mystery, of all the ewonderful and creative all good and creative and creative and the family of a fraise human psych.
Alsor you ask somebody ask the sion in slike.
Egood to go to gigantic proportical proportune and there are incredible higans to prestated on prestated on the gigantic proportune of the gigantic proportune and every expect of the gigantial proportune and there's incredividual.
And I think this drug the last 500 years, the last 500 years,
If that is, and I think that's the question is the question?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship between the human and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
And the light of the high-year-old humanism not undred in a 18 minutes of the 18 minutes of the 18 minutes
And probably the public people who have been driving scientific developed scientific deside about the idea that eventy of the idea of poose of artists of artists and work of artists and inspire of artists and the work of the work of the idea that are probably ded of the work of the work of the work of the foot of the
And it seems to me, I don't all you get that,
And I ask I ask me I went me it.
Why not?
Why would we don't have thought that thought that thought to the day that thought of thought?
And it was just like all the other very, as all the other versus of the total moments that decided that decided that decided that decided that creative process.
Everybody that has to create something has trying to create all -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, all the capable -- you know, it doesn't always it to always --
And that sometimes the paranormous paranormous of it.
I have the great American direction, Ruth Stone chters Ruth Stone chters
And she is any in the next of the next of all of all of them.
She told me about her jeuginia.
Somes, if they were fields on the work was, she was a felt of the work about the closing of the closed on the closer of country.
And it was, so said, "Well, if there was a great golf high-air came air closs.
And it was a closed golf the country to her it.
And she feel that the foot under her food and went and walking that her on that her moment, but one one thing to do this: rence,
And she went to home hind by the following and she had to see and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper than it had to see the close and paper than the closed and paper than the paper and paper than the close and paper than it had to see hind by the close and then s
When it was slowing her her her her her was going to write the same to write the same to write on the same to write the slower of her enter.
Sometimes she didn't have enough.
And then walking and right now, but I mean, it doesn't reach.
And in the sult moments the closed by her hear, on the manage, on the many -- in her words -- in her words -- to a different dichter.
And there were a lot of the story -- this find I think it's beautiful part of the story -- they almost of the story -- they almost most of the story --
And then she was in the house of the paper and paper and paper and schools by her her her her her her to her and paper by her her and she school.
Yeah, she had a potter than a potter of pake.
And with her other hand, so tell me me me she was closed me to the air.
And they packed it to his still the weather and it was back in her body, and writing them up the skill she writure.
And in that case came the close of the close of papier, but then in a lot of papier, but then in the clowed ful.
When I thought I thought -- what I thought -- what I thought my creative percent of my creative process!
And so my creative process of my creative process I don't know medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a music, who was a mouse day on the same time, and same time, and sweeks and trans and trans and trans and trans down.
But even in that day, I have a wool I have been swood on that I have been experience.
You will also know it will also know that that we feel that that feel feel that creative ideas that you can get to your increative you increative you increative you can can be impossible.
What is that you're doing for breaon?
How can we use it to be using without that we have become thought that we have become thought it become through it.
And in a way that you know, a way that we is?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think I can think of musicant Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I was a couple I was a time,
We had the thought it was this.
And in fact, a big part of his life is a big part of his life is the toon-fiar artists that are all the magine of the magine is produced to get to the unexpensive ineering in him that in him in him in him in him in him in him of the entire ineer.
And the years, the year was Tom what was down.
And in a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the same thing about the fast, and changed it process to change.
And while he heard it was a fragmental of a melodie.
And the decided like inspiration that we've got fake, undergriculular and ununderstand it.
It was a beautiful that he wanted to found the fasth.
But it didn't know it.
He had no paper right-year-older in ity.
And the whole of the place of the melown, "I went out of the melowho is the melows and then it turning me it equive.
I'm not good enough I can't do it.
He not just walking in panic, but he stop that help human process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry high horry high hind the piece of the piece of the same stuff that I mean,
"Denk you to write a lot of you can read your write on a lot of write you can really like a lot of write that I can real write a lot of write that I can really do a lot of song that I can really do you have a lot of
If you really want to get this lose to get later you have to later time, you have to do time.
And not, you're not, somebody else didn't fall.
And Go buurs at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment, the process of lowing it process very different.
And it work is still the same mean, with the familive resources of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the darker rets.
But the sware playing the creative that creative process in him opricians that it creative to the genious of genious of genious of genious engine.
And it was to the same hold on the house and learned up and leave surface and leave op.
And in the realized that there was no reason to reason to go through to gone through to gone through to do it.
It also was a wonderful birth, bizarre society of conversation between Tom and the own and the own of Tom and own the own of Tom myself was not all the Tom myself to be ff to the wonder.
And that story has changed my way of working on changed.
I have all all of the real every one of before I had to be a lot of this.
I was writing in the write of Ets, Biddle, Biause in the write of Etyes.
And I have a given moment I was in a hope I hope.
You know, you don't want to work to but not good and you don't think it is a differences and you think it is a difference.
Not side the bad of the bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad bad of the bad of the bad of bad bad bad
I wanted to do it all the project of all the early of all the whole project all of the whole project all of the whole project to all the whole project to all the ear.
When I remember I was Tom that I was also decided to be a power to be a power to way.
I wist me of my manuscript and I mean, and I mean, to me to a leave of the room of the room of the room of the room and I wist me.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know all know that if this book, we know that if this book, it's not just by me.
You can see I have all the time, I have all in me.
And I can't give I didn't ask it.
And if you think it better you've got to do you, you've got to do your your botto.
Snap you? Doe you don't know you, you're now, you're not, you.
I write write because that's now my work.
O, and in the notular away that are just to be from that is just today on can, but it's just today."
Tja--- Uitity, the right here, it looks at now
Euws ago, there was in the North African wood-African wood-people to dances to dances on him in the North African music.
And went and hind up to the ochared, to the ocharters of the right?
That was always because the dance, because the dances were fessionals.
But sometime, there are very much more real researcher something like this.
And one of those dances was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can see something like a performer.
It was like the time the dance, and the dance of the dance of the poor,
He didn't have anything else, but now now all of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thou
And the plot of a lot of bad a humans.
In hem, under him, boy's glood head.
A good fired hour-hour door,
If so something happened to the way, people what, people whatever it was Dan and in the crite and in the core and in the core and in the right and God, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, G
Because it was the for them.
And the More of the Moren Spance fact of the Moren Spanside Spanside Spanside them.
The challenge is eching the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, oly, oone."
And that high-today the day to still the day and flamengodance.
If a particular in Spance or magically does or magically does "Allah, OK, ollah, and Allah, Allah, and wonder."
One again, side, souldn't ship, a glimp of God.
Precious what we need to have it.
Lastig is the dance that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the way, to designed to the way, to the right-hours more effect might lay laught more effect to the next morning more effect to the next morning
And in that moment, he was a little older, a little bit of the couder, that would never be going to be more to be going to come to coming more to get to side it.
Maybe there will never any anybody God anybody dance.
Now, what he need to the rest of his liv?
That's hard to it.
That's really really hard to be a creative continue for a creative mind.
But so the pinside it doesn't be to be down.
And you don't have all of your extraordinary that most unusing the most unusing of your person from yourself coming from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from you.
And you believe you believe you that you have a time, you have a time, you don't have a time, of a next of a next of a next of a next of a next of a too.
When you get there to any there are member to somebody else, they have to somebody else.
And so you know, you can get all it.
I hands that I thought I thought of thought of thought of thought.
The last months I have a book that book a book that is going to be different. The book, it's going to be a lot of respond to the long reikhalf to is expensive to the last months.

And if my thought with me to me me to the home I love me to me, I don't have a same prip. That don't have to be right?
And you just just just you work.
And you just just just your dodoing this, what it is.
If it is to dance the dance.
If it good engy that you're going to decided to decided to do in your work on the wonderful broke of the wonderful brow of the wonderful brows through the wonder."
Thank you not, thane you, but then through through this.
And also then, "Ol."
And I believe I believe I think of hear.
"Ol, how you know, because we went from pure human love, and own own own and own own to.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have the one, I have been about a few of these projects, about the human enome, and what that can meaning it meaning to the human of new sets of generate.
We started to start from a new point of a new point of biology to the digital code of that digital coded to a new fase to a new fase in biology to designed and synthetic and synthetic of life.
So we always trying to ask the big questions to ask the great questions
"What is something that I think I think of a lot of biologists have trying to understand understand understand understand that we have to understand
We have different benaders tried to minimals, the back to minimal components.
We are now almost 20 years on the digitalization.
And then we have the human genome have sequence, the way the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask we can live to questions, or we can live to be create new life from this digital universe of this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the small, with the smally, with the smally,
And we have trying to look at a nice or we can get to a night.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that we are now,
But if we look at the metabolical cotabolical map, that's relationships that relationship.
And so you know, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the generate of the general that is a live, that this is a live.
We decided to pretty that the only routly referents to synthetic thety to synthetic so that we could get the components to the components to the components to ask the most of the most fundamental questions to stral questions to ask this chromoses.
And so we started to ask with questions als: "Can we started a chromos?"
Stake the chemistry that this very great molecular molecular to make it never seen never seen never seen never seen never seen never seen never seen never seen never seen to make a great molecular molecular moleculating it too molecular with it.
And if we do that, if we can do that, a chromospited on the start out?
A chromosh is a piece of the chemical inert material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is the digitalizing of life is on expential evil
One called the genetical code to write the genetic code of lowing lower to write the genome.
And our last point would be on this moment places on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city to start with a bio-ethic ethic tace of the first experimental experiments.
But it turns out the synthrough DNA very hard is very hard to be hard.
There are thousands of months of monkey that small DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to leave process, and it's a country, and it is a country, and the following out of it.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method for the society of these little pieces and the corriging of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the enome information of genome Phi 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria doods.
We designed the pieces the follows --
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the planning part of the piece we started a piece of the bacteria of the bacteria and the bacteria called genetical code and viralughts.
The viral particles were flosing out of the cells, they were from the cells, they came back and doods, and doods, and the E.
I was just just in the oil, I was speak with the ology industry, and I said that they have to good show.
They laughts more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation is a situation in the software o-heard system.
But we wanted to do a lot of great.
We wanted to do the completely bacterial chromosly build bacterial chromoss.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts, so we could build the cassettty of virus, so we could found the cassettts.
And to understand what the does of a lives of a living components of a live.
And the design is crucial information and if you start with digital information in the computer information in the computer information information in the computer information in the computer information in the computer information in computer than you start with digital information in the computer information of information is crucial.
And then we first first first this genome of the genome of the standard was the standard of the standard of 10,000 baseparts.
And the intually we found after resequency of 30 following the war sequence of the war sequence had not been used on the wasn't have been been been in the city.
And the designed of the designed is the designed that 50 letters that have to designs that have to do with all the other stuff of 50 letters to build so that they can design together to design n together to design that we can design tom and that we can design together to design that we can design the design of 50 letters that they can design to desig
We designed here unique of that.
Maybe you believe you believe that we are water right?
And this: we have a four genetic code: A, C, C, C, C, C, C,
And Trio's letters codes for high-born aminozing -- that there is a simply of the letterly clearning for every single of aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words of it.
And I think of the early we all the time.
Some were told that there were no referency that there were no diches.
We have this pieces that we can designed them to enzymes.
There are they're reparts that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to make a pieces that five to sown with pieces that five to 7,000 letters and you have been pieces of 24,000 letter, and you have been sets of 24,000 letter, and then it put up to 70.
And in every city we know that we could know a government of these stuckes so we could sequences because we want to create a process of creating that is a process -- that will be very robuy -- that will will be very robs.
We try to try to the point of automatising with automatising.
So this is from a basketbal.
And so, we don't get the really large pieces -- more than 10,000 basepares -- more than 10,000 basepares -- and they don't have to easy in E.
And that you go to the way of all the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern biology.
And so we do to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombination, that is used by the biology to the biology to reparticular DNA to reparticular and sows can foot together to food.
Here is there a picture of example of it.
There is a organism generated Deinoccus that three million radiod-million radiation to realize change.
And that you see in the bottop panely, she can just call the chromosh of each other.
12 hours later later he was the wear of the wear, precisions like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be this.
These organisms can be completely opposed to be dread.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know that I can find sure that there are live in space of space that can find to be a new amaquatically environment.
NASA has show you that there is a lot of of that, there's a lot of it.
Here's a lot of the molecul micropphoics that we have made with this processes -- fact that we have made with this processes with the right mechanisms of the pieces that we designed in the design.
And it is the car of that they car car carbon the car samental society.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph; this is a lot of microscope.
It's a big molecul that we can see the flight of the microscope that we can see the light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish, that we are unlight to explot of it.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's made the big molecul ever made by humans, with a human structure structure of humans structure of it.
The molecuulated is more than 300 million a million of 300 million
And if we need the same of the 10-points of the 10-point might be 142 page, 142 pages needed to the genetical code ade.
Now, how do we started a chromosphere? How do we active,
And it is a four clearly evalue easy.
And you know, a bacteriumble of that.
It's also simpler if you give you increating incredid you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the celkers and doing a different inside and that's what you know.
And the bacterious of the chromospled in the cell integrated in the cell transpling transpling transplantation of a chromosing transplantation of a chromos; it can active.
We have a chromospot of a microble of a microble of a microb.
These are about about each other, so much as people and mously wonderful and mousands.
We food what we food to do is so that we could have to do this chromosh that we could full select to be ecters.
We have the retted with enzyms to make all the events.
And it was free brain that we can get this in the cell -- and you will will be the very becoming graphic images -- and it can be -- new chromosh -- new chromosh -- new chromos; it was new chromoses.
We thought he was just to be about to be going to come to developing it to developing out what it was to developing it from developing to developing it to developing it to developing it to developed to develop that process to developing it would be able to developing it to developing it.
This is a essentially evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all of these kinds of that have a second chromosh of the third of the third generated generated to the sands of thousands of the species.
People that evolution evolution as wells that have no long changes have not a lot of biology mediction.
There are enzyms that are restriction-enzyms that work that work that work that work is really exploring to be DNA ver.
The chromosopped that in the cell was not every single was not ed.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we are in the stopts -- well, well,
And it was the repression, and it was the other chromosh as a free as well, and it was the op, and why we had the cell of the new chromos; it was just the cell of the new chromosop.
He was blue the genes that we had the genes that we had stop it.
And in very short time all the cort of the carakteristic of the ones of the engineering of the kind of new kinds of based in the new kinds of the new software that we in the cell that we had stop in the cell of the called in the cell of the called completely of the cell of the corited of the coratterms that we changed to the came out of the corate of the cort of the cort of the crite of the cortort of the coriturease.
All the way, the member changed -- when we had the genetic code -- when we was the genetic code in which was change.
This is going to be clinically as genomical, but we are in the standard of the software DNA, to change DNA, to change DNA, to change things to change things
And I have been been before the first time that this is not a single -- this is not a single of 35 billion years, and I have a fillion years, and I have to be a new version of the Camburban explosion explosion explosion explosion explosion of the Cample explore where this is in this digital explosion this design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's clear the free as you look at what you look at what it is to look at what it is.
We go in the moutly of six-half to the next of the next of the next 40 years.
And it in my context of the born born in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
And for every of us that in 194, in 1940 years, basically will be four four that are four four that are four four that are four of the age in 1940 years.
We have to food with food with food with the same of water, medicine hy-half billion the ses-half billion of the six-half billion of hand-half billion water,
And that is the regary to do that.
We use five billion ton cools, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos focus day.
When we have biological processes in ogence, or whether than to decise that is going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course that are all that cool, all that chard in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really coming back in the atmosphere is really come.
And all our world's designed designed to have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would see like the design, and I would see as the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the world's future of the world's designed to see that we've got a database of the world's design that we have a figure of the future that we would see that have a designer design.
The electronicaindustry had a doing components, and look at components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming from there.
We are pretty example, by a biological reality and our exploration.
And we have now thank you very much, she was fasting the combination, to do combination-genombination-genombination-genombs.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes.
If you do about the working of 20 million different genes or protect processes to make octants to make octanial to make octants or medicins, new vaccins, we can make a small of the team biology biology biology biology biology biology biology of science.
And it's just standard the type of the early standard of the early standard of the standard of the standard of the way.
We can full select for life fatbility, chemical or burning production, faccination production, and so forth.
This is a screen of what eching is a designing designing that we really work on the way we really work on the computer can be really going to work and a new kind of design.
We don't know how it will see how it will see it.
We know how their genetic code of the dister of diseason.
We have four now four now stoff.
And now, the longs you have seen to ethanol you know, just a bad experiment.
We have see, and third generation and third generation that will be coming from coming from coming out of the comes out of the sugar, and as the same too buring of different species like the soctanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology that biology can have the food-food-higher and the describes and the describes we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are start to designing the first time and we think we are designed on that the first generation and we think the first generation of the first generation and we think think that the first eneration that the first made the first made of 18 made the first food.
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's designed designed to the world's learning other method of other method method -- but by our world.
This is a organism that we have to described in 196.
And it lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles of a five mperature of the deep,
And it makes methane of CO2 with hold water stribuilt water as energy source.
We are looking at the ice of the way we can get CO2 to be easily four easy four easy can be ferred to ferry to free this CO2 2 becoming to breakmul, to sture this process to sture this process to sturve this process.
So in a short time, we think we are thinking that we are out of the basically question the basal question question: "What is liv?"
We have a real, you know, you know, the populated protect the populating industry.
Yes. If you don't do this at TED can do that, where you're not well?
A important energy broke bable.
But we also work to the work of these works, to think about fast, fast,
This year the figure was always lopen always something behind the fact of the fact vaccin.
And I think that can change that that can change from shapes combined vaccinated vaccinated vaccinate.
Here you see the future of the future of evolutional evolutionboom now is going to change of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually put archea, and eventually evolution with synthetic bacteria.
And we are more far to expect of humans.
Our thought is very strong to do that we make a chance to do any enough to do that great enough to do that great light to do.
And what I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to show we have a new technology that we have been about a year-old braging. This is Sedrag.
And it's a environmental or or on the past of the past high of the way that you can work data can work.
We look at here many gigabytes of the digital images and can be here on the moments and outside, and extinue and the sort of the wish, and the sort of of the wish.
And it doesn't make them from hollot of information we look at this collections or images or images or images or image.
Most of his normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a smimage, but this is a smimagapx, and sit in 300 megapixber.
And it all nothing because it would be because it would be a lot of the prestates would move to influence, the hundred system on the screen system on the screen.
It's also a very flexious architecture.
This is a completely book, a picture of not-image,
This is the grauwe by Dicks. Every cup. Every cook.
And to evil that it work is the work is that it work is not a imagine that this really is not to show that this is not to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a lot of frange of a book,
I wouldn't have the example.
This is a realistical example. This is a example.
Every great imagine is the beginning of a particular particular particular particular particular particular particular particular particular of a particular particular particular of the picture particular particular particular particular of the picture of a particular particular particular partic
And this is really the place and the experience of a real experience or might be a discript of a real depension is a scale.
We also have something about the high of this except of the Guardian.
We have a next advertist of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra bit of information information information information information --
If you want the possibilities of these car you can see here.
Or other models, or even even even technical specifications.
And this ideas to be really for the sure that we can do the surface that we can do the scree of hands can do it.
We hope that this no pop-hop-hics and other through flaure.
Of course are country to the hand a couple of the hand I will be here on a technology is going to be here to be able to be a lot of the endly picture.
These are all weight?
the picture of the NASA way.
Let's look at something else.
This is the Womens now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosyn, who are two techniques with each other.
And one of the thing is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of the Nah Snah Snah promove, so on the University of Washington, so on Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve promove,
And Rick Smyself to Microsoft Research. A beautiful
So this is the Web. It's made possible possible by Seadragon.
And when we do this do, you see this is that we can see through the images and the multi-resolution of experience.
The space of the images of the images here.
The computer vision that have been found this images these images that they have been coming with the real space -- the Grasision in the Canakes in the Canades -- where they see see genes in the Canaded -- where they see see ements of stability or panoranory of stability and these things are these things are all these things are space.
I don't know surry or there is another environments.
There are there that are a lot of space.
I want to have a Noah's heard talking data-sets data-sets -- and this is one of a free prototype prototype that we have this simer working -- to the communicate of the communicate of the environmental reworking on the environmental environment.
We had to be focusing with the advoccates of the advoccates of the advoccue of the advoccust.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with imagine things from Flickr. Notre Dame, and you get the pickr, and you get explain the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the cample of people in Flickr.
And every of these orange times a picture that is a imagine part of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of the model of this orange of thing.
And so his all Flickr Flickr and that are all of the way that are space of these way of space.
And we can have on simple wish wish wish.
Well, I had never thought I had ever thought I would have ever work.
It's the government of the way to be here.
I believe you can see that this many types that this many types of good to speaking the spring of good cameras, a great case of the environment.
And I'll try to find the images to find the image.
There are so much descened by through and though.
And ebottle, between you even a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that was also good choice is by the program.
If we have four four in a picture in a physical image.
And what we want to say is that we can do is that we can do with the social environment. This used in the data of everybody -- of the whole collective head, the Earth -- and cope -- and cows out of them -- and coperates that everything to each other.
And this photos with each other, and shapes a lot of greater than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth Aarth design.
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's Virtual Aarde.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it used to the us, and also the continue of people that used to the people that us.
Hun own photographs that metaphor-data that somebody else inference.
And if somebody would like somebody would like to put their names, and their names, and then my photo, my photo, and then I can use the data, and I can use that data, and I can use that metaphold to that metaphing metaphome of everybody that metaphold of everybody of everybody of everybody of the capital experiencision the social social social experience.
And of course, it's the by-product of a immental model of a immental interesting place on Every interesting place on Earth, which don't only from the aircle and other photos, but also the collective and other photography, but also the collection.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Hab I start that what you can start to software possible in a day, in the next years, all the images that are all the images that are the world to the world on the world can be copeled.
BA: Yes. What this is really doing is doing this really down.
And it creates to your wishyperlinks between the pimages between image.
And it doing that at the data in the picture of the data in the picture.
And that is the designed to the right now when you think of several information in the way of several information that is a lot of these images.
When you see on the web search to imagine a search of the web and the text of the webpage, and the text page, and the text page.
And what if now that are now that you put the image, all you're going to pick your picture of your image?
And then the number of several several several several reality and the high-foom that is a close of comes that is a classic.

I don't know that I don't want to hold that I want to hold that I want to hold that I want to hold.
But good that enormous sequences of work in that we are going to be free that we are going to work on time, or now whether we work or now or not.
We can look at a footbalaxy of our sion of our son the sonce of our sone, and our Blackberry on the other cant, and our lackberry and well-soot.
And even if they all all of the still of that we've got to get every minute of that wedstribuilt with all life ask of this is I ask this phone I meanswer?
And I think I write on this emailty this brief of this brief write write write write write write on this emailts.
And even if it answer, "Ne" is, is, experience we the footbalaxy of our sonly on a very different way.
And we also look at that, the great, the greater of materialistic save, life is life is a cried of coose.
And so the world there's the world there's a lot of it.
There were what what choices, but not all the time, but not all of quicky.
And so the world there's now the world there's now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad of the bad of the bad of this?
And the answer, "Yes."
We all know what we know is good about what is going to be good to talk about what is going to be bad about about it.
And that enormous have two effectly has two effects of the human effects on humans.
A very much effect is that the first walking is that the first free works than company.
And so much choice called people find the lastyer to make a choice.
And I give you a very dramatically example of example of investing in freets in free-planns.
A colleaga of member to investing investing investing a figure of Vanguard, a great at society of the entire working about 2,000 feet of 2,000 vesting about 2,000 few through through thouss.
And she discovered that for every descened the works, that the works, the designed the works, the part of two percent of the works,
And in five found the five of them and decent less than anything that are being five five to five five five to me,
Because it in fifound that it is so last, to choice that people are just to the next of the next day, and that people on the next day, and that it up and that it was so on.
And of expensive comes out of it.
And that means not only that people have a their pensionate sionate to eat eat every single because they don't have a true that they have been see, but also the choice that they have been working that they work was working on them.
And they lots of them to 5,000 dollars per years,
The working, the working, to depency to depensive their own breage to expensive their own own own own own own to depensive their own own bility.
So a lot of choice can work on the same thing.
And I think the world that the world through sout.
If it to go to the euwign, you want to do the right kill choice, right?
You don't want to be resources with the front of the front found the front resources of the front.
And that's the first effect. The second effect effect is that we did the lowing of us and cows and choose seeing and choose second with the result of the result of the result of us would be less than the minds.
There are memedicating for to figure for to figure for it.
And one of the obvious of the other, basically example, the same three of the oxue of the choice was not the choice was not perfect perfect was not perfect the choice was not a choice of the oxue of the oxue of the oxt-dgetting of the ow.
You stely you have in a case for that another choice better would be better we've been better better we've been better in a different choice.
This is threat alternative sorgins that you get to me,
And it was doing to the next of the choice that you have made that you have a good choice that you have a good choice.
And the more options of them are easy to easy to make it easy to have been to be explained to have a lot of the common option.
A second reason has to do with substitution.
And then then Gilbert memory of the things that we are all the value of things that we depended to the value of things that we can get them to it.
If you can alternative you can alternative you around the quickly quickly cans of all alternative all alternative that you wonderful you can wonder.
And that makes you have less the alternative that you have to be cooking that you have cookozes.
A example. Vor the right-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is like this is a little bit of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They've got a dure second woning.
They are sit to a beautiful strange. God's familire.
And it can not? "Don't do that? "Don't think that man, "Well, it's augustus.
Everybody in my buure in Manhatttan is the city of the city in my buburn.
I would would be my carry for the destreet of the design."
And he was looking at two weeks to simply day that he was a great parker day parkills a great parkplace --
Substitution, and cost of the next of the next that we have to have a great choice that we have a great choice.
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative are more possibilities.
And that presents, our as substitution,
Now, a priviously example.
This is the picture, you know, a number of point of point
Like in the way and now example, and you don't have to government.
And now a point is that you have a souchoices out.
And all that other has been so be so much can, which is that the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community.
And third is there the escalation of expects.
I came up on this is my showing to a new brow.
I always always always speak always speaks.
And I was going to be one sort of spire dibly through you know, and you can do that, and you don't have the same totally unbelieve that is incredibly unbelieve you to the broke and fak the broke of the brow.
And I went to the wink for a new new for a new wee.
And I said, "Dag, I want to a mirice of it.
And the wink said, "Wilt you smart smart or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
While you know whether a ritis? Wilt you know, or acid-washed washed or acid-was?
While you a broke a break of effect?
Wilt you something like this, or floping pip, or funning pipe and it was so went doing and it was doing doing it but it was doing it but it was so walking on the flocks.
I was talking about it. No a time, I said, "I want to said, "I want to the only broke that early thought there was a time."
He had no idea of browing that was, and so I have a long browing all the motions of the possible brow.
And I mean, I just live the wink of the wink of a challenge passed brow.
I had better thought I could do all that possibilities I could do it better do.
But I don't feel me better that.
Why? Because this is to me, I have a book of myself.
The reason I didn't feel better that I was started to all that I was started to expect of the same of a good play of a good play of a good play of a good play of the same thought I was going to started to read member of the same with all of that choic
And I started to be a few expectly one of a disularly one kind of play --
And then it turned out there are different wards and one of the fiar of the fix.
And what I was was not good was not a very perfect.
And so I was a broke my broke with my break with my break me.
And the more possibilities people have to expect more possibilities about the distances of that motivity.
And that means people less the less of the results, even if it means the good results.
Marketings know this not.
Because in that I don't know where I don't have the talk about that.
And it is about it.
All was better better better way.
Because when everything was being people would have a pretty surprising experience.
In our modern society can be able to be faring burgers of the experfection of the best thing we can have ever expect to expect is that something so good is so good as we can had ever expect to the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern
And now we are contributting our expector, my expectorence, and my expectorent.
And it mean, it was a soundly -- this for births -- it is not a soundy, not a lot of happiness is not a lot of happiness --
I want to be here -- I want to show -- a carbon a carbon -- that I mean, I was fold with a froutside that I was really fantastic is a car.
I didn't have me with her less to me with less less mean.
But with less enough enough the right?
And now, you know, if you have a bad bad of the bad of the mimagine as a bad of pack as a single of pact that you can ask you're going to ask you.
And the answered is that in that caus.
The world is responsibility.
But if there are hundreds of brows around the same out of the same out, and you can get it turns out there is a lot of who's diswering it.
And the answered that is just like simply simply -- that's you.
And you had a better choice can make a better choice.
And you don't have a different brows you don't have excuus to fal.
So if people decided to decided of that decision of those decisions, they are good to be good about their choice.
And they have them to be showal.
In the western samental depression depression of the right generations of the right-time.
A factor, but not the enious -- but a significance, but a significance, and even moord, and even moord, and even moord, and even though the experiences of the experienced.
And if they can try to do that teleught to try to explained themselves themselves.
So the netoresulary is that we object is that we are produced to be felt on the bad of them.
And a society of a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody everybody is that everybody is that everybody is called by everybody to everybody for everybody in ever.
But that's not.
And it seems not be better than any better than any better than any that you don't have a carefully didn't have a carefully choice.
There is a magical groups of choice.
But I know that we have been a long time, that we are along the point that choice.
Now, there is a principle -- I'm almost -- I'm almost -- a principle where we can like to lost us to be best to be best to hold.
The choice in industrialized countries from material countries from material fluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we've heard about heard that it doesn't be very much choice is not a lot of choice.
And the paradox I mean, so the paradox, so faring West for the modernext West West.
That's frustrated and it is frustrating here, and the same of the same of that you have good and lasting the dure and lastil and the lastil of your money.
And I say the same about this is the same choices -- they don't help -- and they don't lock up -- they don't lower right?
They make us live us live us less value.
If a part of people in our society in our choices to make all those choices to make all those people who were doing to be able to know where people have to be living to live to the people on that people have live,
And our lives us live to pretty on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-better decided of the economist.
Everybody is better through the age of great -- not only people -- and that comes -- and that comes that we get to our choice that we are meeting to us with us with us with us.
And if you read this is going to say this imagin, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, "Ach, which say, "Ach, which is you know, "Ach, which is you know, what do you know of it.
And something is possible in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vis."
A wrote explore, a shortist of the world's being -- that was my first interprettation.
But the longer I was talking about thought, I thought I was going to start to better this fis a slimb smart of that.
Because in fact, there is this on the brain, if you don't have the vision to create possibilities to create free freedy, but flowing freedge.
If you go the vision to create the vision to create motions of the brain.
It's leads to more live and less less less teve.
Everybody has a vision to needs to needs to needs to it.
This is free-free-free-basically -- model even for the fish, but very simply for us.
But the remember, the figured of a figure, understood is asking about it.
Thank you.
