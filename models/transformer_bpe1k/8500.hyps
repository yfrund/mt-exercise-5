No@@ w I tal@@ k to the b@@ as@@ on the b@@ as@@ e b@@ as@@ il@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ : D@@ : D@@ N@@ o I think of what I think I think of wor@@ k wor@@ k.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ : D@@ o M@@ o@@ : D@@ o I me@@ an@@ , I think that I can be f@@ ec@@ t to the f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ oo@@ .

And I h@@ ol@@ d not on@@ ly plan@@ n@@ , but I can tr@@ y to be tr@@ ying to be tr@@ an@@ g@@ er and and and it do@@ w@@ .
And it was a s@@ how the di@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ s of the m@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ ar S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ c@@ e.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
And then you can see my p@@ as@@ si@@ on of the ma@@ king of the ma@@ king of the ma@@ king of the ma@@ king of the ma@@ king f@@ ac@@ es that are the way that are the way that are the way that the way that the way that the way that our c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on our b@@ ra@@ p and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the way and and and and and and the way to the way to the way and wor@@ k.
And s@@ and@@ s I had to be one to be one of the time to be one of the l@@ ast f@@ ound this new wor@@ ld in this p@@ ol@@ lo@@ w and and and and and and and and and and and the l@@ on@@ g that we had the l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@@ g that we are the l@@ ab@@ le@@ .
The first da@@ y that I want to tal@@ k about how to tal@@ k about how to tal@@ k to the inter@@ ac@@ t to the inter@@ ac@@ t of the inter@@ ac@@ ter@@ m@@ id@@ d@@ le and the inter@@ ac@@ ter@@ n@@ al wor@@ ld that the inter@@ ac@@ ter@@ s that the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that we want to our wor@@ ld to the wor@@ ld to the wor@@ ld to do the wor@@ ld to the wor@@ ld that we wan@@ ted to do it the wor@@ ld to do it to do it to the wor@@ ld to the wor@@ ld to the worl@@ d.
I th@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I look at all the p@@ ic@@ k to you to your p@@ ic@@ k with your p@@ ri@@ p@@ .
I a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it is my wor@@ k, but it's a lo@@ t of th@@ .
M@@ y wh@@ ol@@ e I think I think I sa@@ id I think I think I think that that don't think that is not going to think that is going to chan@@ ge that will be chan@@ ge to chan@@ ge@@ .
And then there is something that a l@@ on@@ g g@@ er@@ s something that was something in my lif@@ e and c@@ alle@@ d my lif@@ e, and I was a f@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ d with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k and
It star@@ ted with a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a me@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ m, "@@ B@@ ir@@ , "@@ B@@ id@@ d@@ s, "@@ B@@ id@@ d@@ s, "@@ B@@ ir@@ e wor@@ ld that there was inter@@ n@@ at@@ ed to wor@@ ld the inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al wor@@ ld and wor@@ ld wor@@ ld and inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al wor@@ ld of the inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al wor@@ ld of wor@@ ld wor@@ ld wor@@ ld wor@@ ld wor@@ ld is that that there was wor@@ ld in the worl@@ d.
The ne@@ x@@ t is that people no@@ w that that be@@ ing me al@@ wa@@ ys no@@ w I have to be f@@ lo@@ b@@ .

In the c@@ or@@ t of my f@@ ra@@ in in my f@@ ra@@ is@@ h on on on the f@@ ra@@ in J@@ a@@ h@@ .
Y@@ a@@ a, I'm a b@@ an@@ g@@ , I think of things that that ne@@ e@@ d.
A@@ l@@ wa@@ ys a s@@ ame time@@ .
And I'm al@@ so mu@@ ch for other things that you want to do an@@ g@@ , you don't know that all all the things that all of all all all all all of it.
F@@ or ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and other en@@ g@@ .
But what is what I me@@ , I me@@ as@@ e I me@@ as@@ e I me@@ m@@ sel@@ f the l@@ ast f@@ and@@ s that where where where where where where where people who have a little little an@@ g@@ h@@ an@@ g@@ .

Wh@@ at is so b@@ ir@@ e the b@@ re@@ d of cre@@ ati@@ ve that we can get the f@@ ec@@ ts of the f@@ ec@@ ts of the en@@ ti@@ ve of the en@@ ti@@ st@@ ic worl@@ d, something that is happ@@ en@@ ed to happ@@ en@@ ed to chan@@ ge something that kind of wor@@ k is not going to happ@@ en@@ ed to happ@@ en@@ .
No@@ w w w w w w the f@@ a@@ ther@@ . H@@ e was a s@@ ing@@ le of f@@ a@@ ther@@ , and I can@@ 't me to me that there was a year@@ s, and I can@@ 't be a year@@ s, he di@@ d@@ n't have to be a c@@ oo@@ m to be a b@@ an@@ g@@ .
And then you know, "@@ Y@@ e@@ : Y@@ e@@ a@@ de@@ ?"
No@@ , no@@ , not so mu@@ ch more about it.
And the f@@ a@@ i@@ r be f@@ a@@ i@@ r ma@@ the@@ mat@@ ic@@ i@@ ou@@ s have a re@@ s@@ hi@@ p of the e@@ w@@ er and a re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ ie@@ ce of p@@ ie@@ ce and s@@ ent de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be de@@ pre@@ di@@ c@@ ent and
S@@ ch@@ it@@ e stor@@ y are th@@ is, that have a differ@@ ent t@@ in@@ ce of re@@ pe@@ u@@ t@@ ation@@ .
No@@ t of all the f@@ re@@ e of cre@@ ati@@ ve people have cre@@ ati@@ ve people have the p@@ ri@@ v@@ ation@@ al de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be the p@@ ri@@ be@@ ing in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ .
L@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ , but the re@@ m@@ ul@@ ar the most ma@@ g@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ s of the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ f@@ ic@@ .
And the el@@ ec@@ t of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do th@@ r@@ ough the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And s@@ ame to be the s@@ ame thing that ma@@ de to be the s@@ ame to be the s@@ ame to be their o@@ ther@@ .
In the l@@ ast inter@@ v@@ ie@@ w for his inter@@ v@@ ie@@ d to be a b@@ oo@@ m M@@ a@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ h@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ ."
Th@@ at's what you know, that to sa@@ y what you know, what you know, you know, what you know, you know, you know, what do to do you know,
But of these kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We all have all the s@@ ame time@@ , and the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed c@@ ep@@ te@@ d.
The c@@ ame to be the c@@ ame thing is that that that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity to the s@@ lo@@ b@@ al s@@ on@@ ly with a re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ ed and that is a re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ es to be a re@@ s@@ ent to be to re@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
And then I want to you to do a f@@ il@@ l@@ y, I want to you a f@@ ra@@ gen@@ e@@ : you can do with me@@ an@@ ?
D@@ o you know that O@@ K@@ ? O@@ K@@ ? O@@ K@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use I think about it.
I think it was the s@@ in@@ e@@ d.
And al@@ so al@@ so mu@@ ch as a very s@@ ame time@@ .
I di@@ d@@ n't like this this this this this this is that this e@@ u@@ g@@ .
We can cre@@ ati@@ ve to cre@@ ati@@ ve a lo@@ t of c@@ oun@@ ta@@ ke to f@@ .
I know that it was a m@@ i@@ ou@@ t@@ ly for the m@@ i@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ b@@ le of the b@@ ir@@ on@@ g that would be to that to that to that to that would be a d@@ on@@ g to the m@@ i@@ ma@@ de to be a da@@ y.
And then the f@@ as@@ e f@@ as@@ e in my c@@ ri@@ ve f@@ as@@ e in my c@@ ri@@ ve no@@ w be@@ .
G@@ e@@ a@@ : I th@@ is, I th@@ re@@ e th@@ r@@ ough a b@@ it of th@@ .
I can be ma@@ y@@ be be be be be be be a vi@@ de@@ cen@@ t@@ y f@@ our de@@ cen@@ t.
And so the wor@@ k is that I will see what I will be be going to see the p@@ ic@@ e@@ er of the b@@ oo@@ m that I think the b@@ ra@@ in the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that the b@@ oo@@ m that the b@@ oo@@ m.
We are with f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s, I can see the f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s, I can do it it to do you you know, I can see the s@@ m@@ ight s@@ k@@ l@@ y, I can be my gr@@ ound my b@@ ig@@ g@@ h@@ t s@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ .
J@@ em@@ ig@@ , what a ide@@ !
I@@ f you think of c@@ oun@@ d, you know, if you think it is the f@@ re@@ e to the f@@ re@@ e the f@@ ol@@ d to the f@@ ur@@ e of the f@@ ol@@ d.
So that's no@@ t.
I lo@@ ve me with the wor@@ k with the wor@@ k with the wor@@ k of where I s@@ how to see the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of where I can see the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on on qu@@ est@@ i@@ on on is "@@ H@@ oo@@ ?"
No@@ w for a l@@ on@@ g of n@@ a@@ den@@ ce I can think that that that I can be a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ ess in the in@@ c@@ ess of the in@@ c@@ es in the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the in@@ si@@ de pro@@ c@@ ess of the in@@ c@@ e.

I have the b@@ re@@ ad of the b@@ re@@ ad to do that that to do that to do that to do that to do that to do that to do that@@ .
I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I think is the s@@ m@@ it@@ e of the sc@@ ri@@ v@@ ed to other differ@@ en@@ ce to see a differ@@ en@@ ti@@ ons and ma@@ y@@ be a way to cre@@ ati@@ ve to cre@@ ati@@ ve the en@@ v@@ ed to make the en@@ ti@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ons of the cre@@ ati@@ ons of cre@@ ati@@ ons of the cre@@ ati@@ ons of the cre@@ ati@@ ons of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ate pro@@ c@@ ess of the cre@@ at@@ ed de@@ ep@@ t of cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ation@@ .

M@@ e@@ op@@ le have cre@@ at@@ ing that cre@@ at@@ ing cre@@ at@@ ing the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y.
And for the first first of the first wor@@ ld is about the st@@ re@@ e@@ d, and there was a s@@ m@@ it@@ e that they were sa@@ y that they were sa@@ y that they were a s@@ ha@@ d.
I ne@@ ed to sa@@ y that I have to fin@@ d a bi@@ g b@@ ig@@ g@@ .
O@@ K@@ , one pers@@ on a pers@@ on@@ e, one of the c@@ in@@ di@@ v@@ ir@@ e of the s@@ ame thing he sa@@ id that he was a s@@ ing@@ le of the b@@ ro@@ ss the b@@ ro@@ ss of the e@@ u@@ m@@ it@@ e of the e@@ u@@ m@@ it@@ e of what is the n@@ at@@ u@@ m@@ it@@ y, and the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the comp@@ an@@ y and the cre@@ ati@@ v@@ e, and so that is a lo@@ t of the sy@@ ch@@ i@@ v@@ it@@ i@@ on of f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
A@@ l@@ l you know, you know, you know, the s@@ how to f@@ i@@ on the s@@ li@@ k@@ e.
E@@ g@@ g@@ er are to be b@@ la@@ z@@ ing to be f@@ lo@@ b@@ al tr@@ ac@@ ro@@ p@@ le and then then the b@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And I think this is this d@@ ru@@ e in the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ .
I@@ f that is, that is so the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ ou@@ ?"
C@@ o@@ ther@@ ?
C@@ om@@ e we star@@ ted to un@@ der@@ st@@ and the en@@ g@@ er of the el@@ t@@ us@@ es and the hu@@ man and the worl@@ d@@ ?
M@@ a@@ y@@ be not no@@ t.
W@@ ell, we can be 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , we can be 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ .
And then the p@@ ic@@ ally re@@ al s@@ ha@@ p@@ er to the p@@ ic@@ e that people who have the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ m@@ it@@ ies that ma@@ de the ide@@ a that ma@@ de that ma@@ de the ide@@ a of what the ide@@ a of what what is to do with what is to the worl@@ d.
It loo@@ ks like that@@ , I don't know that I think I don't have to get me in your me@@ e@@ .
And then I f@@ ol@@ d me to the s@@ ame me of me me
Wh@@ y di@@ d@@ n't do th@@ ?
Wh@@ y we di@@ d@@ n't have to be to be a da@@ y that we di@@ d to be de@@ sig@@ n@@ ?
It c@@ ame out of the c@@ l@@ et is like th@@ r@@ ough the other c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge@@ s of the t@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge@@ s that the c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ or@@ n@@ .
I@@ f a very very s@@ ame thing that has something to cre@@ ati@@ ve a very pro@@ c@@ ess of cre@@ ati@@ ve -- and so the all of all of all the things -- and and here -- and here -- and here -- and here -- and here -- and here -- and here -- and here that the cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess of the s@@ ame thing --
And that s@@ om@@ b@@ a par@@ an@@ t@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ s ma@@ de the s@@ k@@ e.
I have to do the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y the an@@ g@@ s A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an R@@ u@@ t@@ h R@@ u@@ t@@ h S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g the s@@ on@@ g of the di@@ sc@@ over@@ .
They is in the ne@@ x@@ t ne@@ x@@ t H@@ er@@ . H@@ er@@ e's a s@@ m@@ it@@ e f@@ lo@@ w@@ .
They di@@ d me about h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er on the pl@@ at@@ ed of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a.
S@@ om@@ e, when they f@@ i@@ ma@@ k@@ s, the f@@ i@@ ma@@ de the wor@@ k of the the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ he was a s@@ he was a l@@ on@@ g and the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ g of the worl@@ d.
It was wa@@ y, so so a s@@ ing@@ le of f@@ i@@ ve or a gre@@ at f@@ ul@@ ar f@@ lo@@ w@@ er of c@@ ame l@@ an@@ c@@ ame to the l@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And so the s@@ ame time@@ , the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and at h@@ er of the l@@ and and the l@@ and s@@ he was the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ on@@ e.
They were the f@@ ood that the the f@@ ood that the b@@ ig@@ h h@@ er of h@@ er and s@@ ha@@ p@@ e that ma@@ de that there was one m@@ om@@ ent to do that one one of the one of the en@@ r@@ en@@ den@@ t of h@@ er for h@@ er h@@ er to do a h@@ er of lif@@ e.
They then then a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and they s@@ he loo@@ king at the di@@ sc@@ al@@ e and s@@ he was so so so so so f@@ a@@ il@@ l and s@@ how to see and and and s@@ m@@ ight and and and and and and and s@@ he@@ 's s@@ m@@ ight and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and s@@ he loo@@ king at the s@@ m@@ ight and s@@ he s@@ how to see the s@@ ame and s@@ he was very b@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And when the di@@ d di@@ d th@@ r@@ ough the di@@ d was a s@@ ing@@ le of h@@ er that was that was a f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
S@@ om@@ e@@ e was not s@@ ne@@ ed to be s@@ ne@@ ed to be s@@ ne@@ ed to be s@@ ne@@ ed to be s@@ how they di@@ d@@ n't have a s@@ m@@ us@@ .
Th@@ en w@@ ent to the h@@ om@@ e@@ d, but it is not the h@@ ou@@ t.
And in the other ch@@ ul@@ ar m@@ om@@ en@@ ts of the di@@ d s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of h@@ er -- and a s@@ m@@ us@@ ed on a differ@@ en@@ ti@@ l -- in h@@ er -- in h@@ er of other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other ch@@ ar@@ .
And in fac@@ t, you know, there were a little b@@ ig@@ h -- I think this -- this -- this is the m@@ om@@ b@@ le of the first -- they di@@ b@@ le -- they can be the di@@ b@@ le of the di@@ b@@ le -- they have the di@@ b@@ le --
And then they was in h@@ om@@ e and p@@ ap@@ i@@ er@@ , and it was the di@@ sc@@ al@@ e of h@@ er and s@@ oo@@ m by h@@ er h@@ er and s@@ he@@ ar@@ .
Y@@ u@@ is@@ t that s@@ he had a s@@ he had a s@@ m@@ om@@ ent to f@@ a@@ d.
And with h@@ an@@ other h@@ an@@ d, the s@@ he was a pl@@ ac@@ e pl@@ ac@@ e to the a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
They c@@ ame to be the di@@ st@@ ed to be the di@@ st@@ er@@ , and it was very h@@ er in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to the s@@ o@@ .
In fac@@ t, that all the c@@ ame or@@ m@@ it@@ s in where the s@@ ame time@@ , but in a very p@@ ap@@ p@@ ap@@ p@@ ap@@ p@@ ap@@ p@@ .
And then I th@@ ough@@ t that I th@@ ough@@ , I th@@ ough@@ , what I th@@ ough@@ , what the f@@ al@@ li@@ g@@ , my pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of my pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess
And it wor@@ k to my pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the m@@ is@@ h@@ !
I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , who th@@ ough@@ t of the s@@ ame time@@ , who was on the s@@ ame time@@ , and then the s@@ ame and then the s@@ ame and then and then then then then the s@@ ame and and then then then then then then the s@@ ame and re@@ me@@ .
But even in that s@@ ame that was in that s@@ ame time@@ , I have been f@@ ar@@ ound a s@@ ing@@ le of f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ t@@ ly f@@ ar@@ y f@@ ar@@ y.
Y@@ ou@@ 're al@@ so f@@ ul@@ ar the c@@ oun@@ d, that there can be cre@@ ati@@ ve that that that there is that there is that that that there is that that there can be cre@@ ati@@ ve a b@@ ro@@ ss and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and you can be a b@@ ro@@ ss f@@ ic@@ .
Wh@@ at is that for th@@ ?
Ho@@ w can we use the s@@ al@@ th@@ out we think we think we can think we think we think we think we think we think we can think we think we think we think of the wor@@ ld is to think of the s@@ ame wor@@ k.
O@@ n a way that we have a way to do for us for us for us for us for us to be a way of th@@ ?
The first con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ a@@ ge that I can see this me@@ an@@ , I can see this is to me@@ an@@ , and T@@ o@@ w@@ .
A p@@ ut a year@@ -@@ ol@@ d in the s@@ ame time I was a s@@ ame for a s@@ ing@@ le of f@@ i@@ f@@ t.
We di@@ d it th@@ re@@ e it was this th@@ is.
And in fac@@ t, is a bi@@ g of the f@@ re@@ e of the li@@ v@@ es of the li@@ v@@ ed of the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ ame thing that all the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e of all the en@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ ce of the en@@ g@@ in@@ ce of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ .

And as he was so a f@@ ra@@ g@@ , he was so a f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ ting a little b@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ ting a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ al s@@ o@@ di@@ e.
The be@@ c@@ ame to the s@@ oo@@ m like th@@ is, like th@@ ir@@ ation that f@@ a@@ k@@ er f@@ a@@ k@@ er f@@ a@@ k@@ er b@@ il@@ , b@@ ig@@ n@@ .
It was a m@@ om@@ y that he wan@@ ted to the f@@ as@@ ic@@ e the f@@ as@@ si@@ on.
But that di@@ d@@ n't w@@ ent that was not not not not not not not no@@ t.
H@@ e had a p@@ ap@@ i@@ er@@ t@@ en a p@@ ap@@ i@@ er@@ .

H@@ e qu@@ est@@ i@@ on in p@@ an@@ i@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a differ@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess to be a pro@@ c@@ ess and de@@ c@@ ess and de@@ sig@@ n@@ .

It wor@@ k is that it wor@@ k with the s@@ ame thing with the s@@ ame me@@ an@@ , with the s@@ ame time@@ .

It ne@@ ed to the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ed on the h@@ om@@ en@@ .

Th@@ at has been one of the way of wor@@ ld is the way of wor@@ k.
I have a very pro@@ f@@ i@@ l of pro@@ f@@ i@@ le@@ .
I was s@@ how the f@@ re@@ e of the r@@ it@@ e of E@@ t@@ s, B@@ em@@ p@@ , B@@ em@@ er@@ .
And in a c@@ it@@ e of f@@ i@@ ve I was in h@@ op@@ ul@@ l I h@@ op@@ .
You want to do that you want to think you to think it it it it it to think it and you want to think it a differ@@ ri@@ k@@ es that you can think it a differ@@ ri@@ p@@ le of the re@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ .
No@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , the s@@ le@@ ch@@ , really really really really really really f@@ ri@@ p@@ le of th@@ is.
I want to do the wh@@ ol@@ e pro@@ jec@@ t the pro@@ jec@@ t pro@@ jec@@ t of the en@@ ter@@ .
And then I me@@ m@@ b@@ er I was to be the T@@ o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e to be the T@@ o@@ b@@ .
I di@@ d me of my f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ re@@ e and p@@ ri@@ p@@ s and and and and the am@@ er@@ .

Wh@@ at do it with the re@@ st of lif@@ ?
Th@@ at's a di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ .
Th@@ at is a di@@ d of di@@ d to cre@@ ati@@ ve a cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve for a cre@@ ati@@ ve of f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve for a cre@@ ati@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve for a cre@@ ati@@ ve of cre@@ ati@@ ve f@@ ic@@ e.
But as as it do@@ ing it as it do@@ .
S@@ te@@ l that you don't have the most of the most im@@ al@@ e of your me@@ an@@ , the most of your your your your b@@ re@@ as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of you@@ r@@ sel@@ f of you@@ .
And then you have a s@@ k@@ es that you have a little b@@ re@@ a@@ ther to get a little b@@ re@@ as@@ e of n@@ a@@ ther to get a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther of n@@ a@@ ther to f@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ al f@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ al f@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ al f@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ .
And when you do it in the c@@ l@@ er of the me@@ , they are going to do the@@ y@@ 're going to do the@@ y@@ 're going to be a differ@@ en@@ t.
And so it ma@@ k@@ es a b@@ il@@ l@@ y.
I h@@ an@@ y that was a s@@ ing@@ le of that was going to be h@@ an@@ .
The l@@ ast ma@@ de of the l@@ ast ma@@ de of a b@@ oo@@ m that was wor@@ k that b@@ oo@@ k@@ e, the wor@@ k that is going to make a lo@@ t of re@@ al re@@ s@@ hi@@ p to make a lo@@ t of h@@ al@@ f of h@@ al@@ f for h@@ al@@ f of h@@ al@@ .
The op@@ er@@ g@@ er of the op@@ er@@ , which is the op@@ po@@ wer@@ .
I@@ f my da@@ y with the h@@ al@@ f of the s@@ ame thing I was the s@@ ame s@@ ame to the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ ame thing that the s@@ ame thing that S@@ e@@ t@@ ly S@@ e@@ t@@ en S@@ e@@ t@@ en S@@ e@@ t@@ en S@@ e@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ at's just just wor@@ k.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use you can do it it it it is.
I@@ f you th@@ an@@ s@@ es, you to do th@@ an@@ s@@ es.
I@@ f the g@@ ood b@@ as@@ si@@ on that you can get to get to the b@@ ro@@ ss and to wor@@ k to the en@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine and to be a b@@ ro@@ ss the w@@ r@@ ight of the w@@ r@@ ough the l@@ an@@ g@@ er than O@@ l@@ , and then O@@ l@@ , "@@ O@@ l@@ , "@@ O@@ l@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ e, "@@ O@@ l@@ .

And that is the s@@ ame of di@@ d@@ s.
"@@ O@@ l@@ , and how we don't know how to f@@ i@@ ve the p@@ ur@@ e of the o@@ wn f@@ lo@@ v@@ ed and the e@@ ar@@ ound the e@@ very s@@ m@@ us@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ ! O@@ l@@ !
W@@ e@@ et me -- I have the s@@ how you know, I had a p@@ ic@@ e of these pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, the hu@@ man be@@ t@@ ter and the hu@@ man be@@ t@@ ter of the worl@@ d, and the de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
We st@@ ar@@ e@@ d, we were a new p@@ un@@ ti@@ r@@ e of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and we we were no@@ w to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and then we we were to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and sy@@ n@@ g@@ ic@@ al and sy@@ n@@ g@@ ic@@ al and sy@@ n@@ g@@ th@@ .
So we have a s@@ ame to tr@@ y to be tr@@ ying to the bi@@ g f@@ ra@@ st@@ .
"@@ Wh@@ at is something that I think is something of what I think is something of what is something I tr@@ y to do man@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ e and de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
We have differ@@ ent ent b@@ re@@ a@@ der@@ st@@ and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ed the f@@ ol@@ d to the comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s.
W@@ e@@ 're the b@@ in@@ ce 2@@ 0 years of the b@@ ig@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed 2@@ 0 years of the b@@ il@@ .
And then we have the hu@@ man ne@@ ed to the hu@@ man ne@@ ed in the an@@ al@@ o@@ b@@ er of the an@@ al@@ o@@ ther@@ , the an@@ al@@ o@@ ther@@ , the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
No@@ w we can tr@@ y to tr@@ y to f@@ ra@@ gen@@ er@@ s, or we can cre@@ at@@ ed this new new s@@ un@@ i@@ ver@@ al s@@ un@@ i@@ ver@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ al di@@ su@@ m@@ b@@ ?
This is the c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the in@@ gen@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ ic@@ al of the c@@ alle@@ d that kind of f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of v@@ ir@@ e in a c@@ it@@ sel@@ f in a c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ .
And we have to do to do to do a little b@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ d to get a little b@@ ir@@ d to get a little b@@ it to be a little b@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ .
We can be the or@@ th of the or@@ d@@ re@@ d of the 5@@ 00 of the f@@ i@@ ve 5@@ 00 or or or or so so so so so mu@@ ch as a f@@ i@@ le@@ .
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ r@@ ati@@ ve is that the f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the s@@ ame thing with the s@@ ing@@ s.
G@@ oo@@ m is this this si@@ mp@@ , this is this si@@ mp@@ le is this si@@ mp@@ le f@@ ol@@ d.
But when we look at all the ne@@ x@@ t of all the ne@@ x@@ t that we can see the p@@ ie@@ ce that is the s@@ on@@ ly that is that the b@@ on@@ ly that this is a b@@ on@@ ly that this is that this is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a le@@ c@@ op@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ op@@ ul@@ .

S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y the ma@@ de of these ma@@ de to make these ch@@ em@@ y to make these ch@@ em@@ y to make it to make the st@@ il@@ l that we have to see the s@@ ame time@@ ?

A ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ell@@ s is tr@@ om@@ en@@ s but you can get a p@@ ie@@ ce of c@@ alle@@ d a little b@@ ir@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ .

And our c@@ alle@@ d the ne@@ e@@ t@@ y to the ne@@ e@@ t@@ y f@@ lo@@ ve of the r@@ ic@@ k@@ e, but but it's not just just just a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g@@ .
And our l@@ ast f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w would be on this on a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
We star@@ ted 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ , 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ ,
Th@@ ere were a s@@ ho@@ w@@ s for ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al di@@ a bi@@ o@@ -@@ f@@ a@@ th@@ ic de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A of D@@ N@@ A lo@@ b@@ .
Th@@ ere are a ti@@ du@@ str@@ ate ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld and the be@@ t@@ ter of the wor@@ ld and the be@@ t@@ ter in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and so you see the s@@ ame thing to be more to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and how to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and how to be more and more and more and how to be more and more and more than how to be more than 5@@ 0 to be more more f@@ ol@@ lo@@ c@@ k more f@@ ul@@ t of how to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
So to make a new s@@ how we have a new s@@ m@@ all the ma@@ king for the hu@@ man of these s@@ m@@ all these little b@@ re@@ e@@ p of these little b@@ as@@ ic@@ al f@@ oo@@ .
And this was our first po@@ g@@ in@@ ce to the first wor@@ ld with the en@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the en@@ ti@@ v@@ ation of the P@@ h@@ h@@ i 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at is a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We have the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the c@@ or@@ re@@ ,
and then a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l c@@ u@@ l of f@@ ul@@ ar 5@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ed be@@ g@@ an we star@@ ted a p@@ ie@@ ce of the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an in@@ st@@ ic and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ tion@@ al and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al de@@ al b@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ s and s@@ how they were s@@ how to the c@@ ell@@ s, they were b@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ d and then they were f@@ il@@ l E@@ o@@ li@@ .
I was going to re@@ min@@ d in the sp@@ re@@ e@@ k with the ol@@ lo@@ w in@@ du@@ str@@ ie@@ s, and I sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they di@@ d to be a s@@ w@@ n@@ .
They lo@@ ve than you more than you@@ .
And then we think this is this sit@@ u@@ ation that this sit@@ u@@ ation is a sit@@ u@@ ation of the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s of the s@@ of@@ tw@@ een a sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we want to want to do something that a lo@@ t of the gre@@ at b@@ ig@@ g@@ er of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ er of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ er@@ s.
We want to want to do the ne@@ x@@ t the ne@@ x@@ t of the s@@ oo@@ m of the s@@ oo@@ m of f@@ ol@@ m
Th@@ at's more 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of a b@@ ir@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we were we ma@@ de we had to be able to f@@ ir@@ us@@ ed to f@@ ir@@ us@@ , so we b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e the c@@ as@@ se@@ , so we can be the c@@ as@@ se@@ s of c@@ as@@ si@@ on of c@@ as@@ se@@ s --
and to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s that the d@@ one of a comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a li@@ v@@ e.
It was de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be a c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ ted with the comp@@ u@@ ter in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter than the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ra@@ l ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l than the comp@@ u@@ ra@@ p@@ .
And then we can be the first 1@@ 0@@ 00 gen@@ c@@ ide@@ d in 1@@ 9@@ 5 per@@ ha@@ p@@ ed the st@@ and@@ -@@ 1@@ 0@@ 00 p@@ er p@@ er 1@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ d.
And the s@@ ame thing we di@@ d we di@@ d to re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce 3@@ 0 f@@ ol@@ d to the sp@@ on@@ e.
And our de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld that we have to be the wor@@ king with the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce that are more and all the other 5@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of all the other 5@@ 0 li@@ v@@ ed 5@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that we can do to be a s@@ m@@ all we have to do to be a s@@ m@@ all that we can be ma@@ g@@ h@@ .
We di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed here and the un@@ der@@ st@@ and the un@@ der@@ st@@ and the un@@ i@@ re@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be you have a s@@ ing@@ le of you have that we s@@ een wat@@ er@@ .
B@@ e@@ k the on@@ ly we have a vi@@ ou@@ t@@ t@@ ter@@ n@@ ed c@@ alle@@ d a vi@@ de@@ o@@ de@@ : A@@ , and T@@ E@@ S@@ , and T@@ E@@ ar@@ , and T@@ E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ 's from the li@@ v@@ es of the li@@ k@@ es for 2@@ 0 year@@ -@@ ol@@ d 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e -- and that there is a b@@ ir@@ on@@ ly -- and that there is a s@@ m@@ el@@ y for the on@@ ly for the on@@ ly c@@ el@@ y for the on@@ ly c@@ el@@ y for the on@@ ly c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
So we can use the ne@@ x@@ ic c@@ alle@@ d the ne@@ w@@ r@@ it@@ e to use the ne@@ w@@ r@@ it@@ e of th@@ ough@@ .
A@@ n@@ d, of the s@@ ame ne@@ er@@ , we di@@ d the m@@ ight of the m@@ ight of the m@@ ir@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were f@@ ig@@ h and re@@ as@@ e that there were no ex@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e that there were no di@@ st@@ er@@ .
We have this this p@@ ie@@ ce that we can be so we have to be so we can be able to be able to f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
Th@@ ere are these are re@@ as@@ ons that they are re@@ par@@ ts in the re@@ al@@ .
And we star@@ ted to make a little b@@ re@@ a@@ il@@ l with a s@@ ie@@ ce of f@@ i@@ ve that f@@ i@@ ve to be f@@ i@@ ve to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies that you have a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get h@@ om@@ e@@ d, and you have 2@@ 0@@ 00 fe@@ el of 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 people who have 2@@ 0@@ 00 fe@@ w to be about 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ one of 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 fe@@ w to be de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be a b@@ re@@ ,
In fac@@ t, the c@@ it@@ e of these c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke a f@@ lo@@ v@@ ed of these stu@@ di@@ d that we can see that we see that we can see that we see that we can see that we ne@@ ed to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess and that we will see that that you can see that that you can see that you can see that you can see that you will see that you will see that you can see you see that you can see you see that you can see that that you can see you can see the s@@ how you see that that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that that the s@@ ame to see the s@@ how to see that that that the po@@ in@@ wer@@ .
We tr@@ y to tr@@ y to the p@@ un@@ t of the au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ al e@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
So this is a b@@ as@@ k of b@@ as@@ k a b@@ as@@ k@@ e.
And we have a p@@ ie@@ ce of the bi@@ g -- we really really really really really really really to get to the bi@@ g -- 1@@ 0@@ 00 -- and then 1@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ , and then they don't have more -- and then they di@@ d@@ n't have more E@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And that is the ma@@ de of all the the the most of all of all the the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we are the other thing we re@@ sp@@ e@@ ed to the other ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We di@@ d a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m that I h@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ al re@@ c@@ it@@ ."

The@@ se can be a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ m@@ s can be a s@@ m@@ us@@ .
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m in a f@@ ac@@ e.
I know what it was a c@@ alle@@ d to be a c@@ alle@@ d that there was a new b@@ re@@ a@@ m that ma@@ de to be a new b@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s, a new b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ y b@@ il@@ li@@ on on of b@@ il@@ y b@@ il@@ y b@@ il@@ y b@@ il@@ y b@@ il@@ li@@ on to be a new b@@ il@@ li@@ v@@ e.

H@@ er@@ e's a s@@ ho@@ t@@ -@@ c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the c@@ ou@@ s of the c@@ ou@@ s -- but with these c@@ oun@@ t -- but with a g@@ ood of the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d with the c@@ oun@@ t of the wor@@ ld that we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed of the wor@@ ld that we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed in the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the worl@@ d.
And the G@@ is@@ t of the m@@ us@@ t that they have to f@@ ood that they have a m@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ al f@@ oo@@ .
This is no el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ .
It's a b@@ ig@@ h of c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .
The@@ se are f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s and a f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ z@@ ing of the se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ ut that we have the p@@ ut that we have the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And this is more 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to the s@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the gr@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ de to mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ le of hu@@ man ma@@ de by a s@@ m@@ us@@ ed by a s@@ m@@ us@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ ul@@ ar 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on on of mil@@ li@@ on d@@ s.
I@@ f we were the s@@ ou@@ s of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ k with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ 1@@ 0@@ -@@ 1@@ 0@@ 2 p@@ , there is 1@@ 2 p@@ er than 1@@ 2 p@@ ic@@ al c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ all of the c@@ alle@@ d to the c@@ all of the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d to the c@@ or@@ .

And it was a vi@@ ru@@ s of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally the ma@@ k@@ e.
And it was a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is the in@@ cre@@ di@@ d@@ n't a lo@@ t of the in@@ v@@ e.
It's al@@ so si@@ mp@@ le if you can get the c@@ or@@ der to get your e@@ u@@ p@@ er and you can do the c@@ or@@ m@@ s, like th@@ is, like th@@ is, as you know, and then the c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke and a little b@@ it and then the c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke and then the c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke and then the l@@ on@@ e.
And we can see the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a of the c@@ alle@@ d is the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ el@@ l re@@ as@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ e@@ ed to a l@@ on@@ g@@ er of a l@@ on@@ g of a l@@ on@@ g of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ on@@ g to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing to a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing of a f@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ .
The@@ se are so man@@ y of these are so f@@ i@@ el@@ y as a f@@ i@@ el@@ l people like people like people and people and people as a s@@ m@@ us@@ .
We f@@ ood ex@@ tr@@ a ex@@ tr@@ a con@@ tr@@ y to this this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ v@@ ed to this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ v@@ ed to this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ v@@ e.

The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing that the c@@ alle@@ d was not a c@@ alle@@ d that the c@@ alle@@ d was not a c@@ alle@@ y.
The c@@ alle@@ d -- the c@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ell@@ s that we --
It was be@@ for@@ e the other c@@ ame to the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ c@@ k the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ v@@ ed st@@ re@@ at@@ ed mat@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ , and the c@@ ro@@ mo@@ v@@ ed with the c@@ ro@@ c@@ k with the c@@ ro@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .

A@@ l@@ l the most of c@@ alle@@ d the me@@ m@@ m@@ b@@ er -- the the m@@ ir@@ m@@ s -- we would chan@@ ge the ne@@ e@@ t@@ y -- the ne@@ e@@ t@@ y and the c@@ lo@@ c@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed in the de@@ c@@ ame thing that was chan@@ ge@@ .
And this ma@@ y be a c@@ l@@ in@@ e@@ d, but we can make it it it to make a st@@ em@@ ic@@ al al@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ , but we can chan@@ ge the chan@@ ge@@ s of the worl@@ d, to make things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge the other things to chan@@ ge of the worl@@ d.
And I don't have a s@@ how to be a p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , I have a p@@ ri@@ p@@ le -- this is this -- this -- this -- this is -- this -- this -- I have a b@@ il@@ li@@ on years a@@ go@@ , I have a mil@@ li@@ on years a@@ go@@ , and I have a s@@ m@@ ight -- I have a new s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of the C@@ am@@ p@@ ed of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ w the C@@ am@@ p@@ er of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ b@@ al ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the worl@@ d, and the s@@ m@@ it@@ al worl@@ d, in the worl@@ d, and we have a new new new new new new s@@ hi@@ p@@ le of the worl@@ d.
Wh@@ y would you do th@@ ?
And I think it's the f@@ r@@ oo@@ m is the f@@ r@@ oo@@ m is what you look at the r@@ ight is what you look at the s@@ ame thing is what you look at what it do@@ .
We go to to the b@@ ir@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f to a b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on to 4@@ 0 year@@ .

Th@@ ere are these are these people on this plan@@ e@@ t@@ ly --
in our lif@@ e of our li@@ v@@ es in the 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ , and there will be a year@@ .
We had to have to have to have to f@@ ood with f@@ oo@@ m f@@ oo@@ m with the s@@ m@@ it@@ e of wat@@ er@@ , or a little b@@ il@@ li@@ on of the e@@ -@@ b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on.
Th@@ at is the s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t to do that to do that@@ .
We use b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ lo@@ v@@ e.
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 b@@ o@@ v@@ e.
Wh@@ en we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ ess to be a pro@@ c@@ ess of pro@@ c@@ ess to be a pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess to be a b@@ us@@ ed to be a or@@ ma@@ de that is going to be a b@@ us@@ ed to be wor@@ d@@ s.

And then our wor@@ ld is our wor@@ ld of our wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that we have a d@@ at@@ ed of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on to a 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ one of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on to see the fu@@ tur@@ e comp@@ on@@ ies and comp@@ on@@ en@@ ce of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ a@@ in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ e of the comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, but the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ i@@ on that are the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y.
We are ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of the c@@ alle@@ d by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity and our c@@ it@@ y.
We have no@@ w have no@@ w te@@ ch@@ , they di@@ d to do a sy@@ n@@ st@@ em@@ er@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ ic@@ al c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d "@@ c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ it@@ ic@@ al s@@ k@@ e.
We have the s@@ ame to make the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ity to make a mil@@ li@@ on on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of a b@@ om@@ p@@ er and f@@ ol@@ d and f@@ ol@@ d and f@@ ol@@ d and f@@ ol@@ d a b@@ om@@ b@@ er and f@@ il@@ l@@ .
I@@ f you can do the stor@@ y of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on on mil@@ li@@ on on of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on on to tr@@ y to make a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ m@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to make a new de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to make a new de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing and we can do with a new c@@ in@@ s, we can do with 2@@ 0 c@@ ul@@ ar with a differ@@ ent c@@ ul@@ ar with 2@@ 0 c@@ ul@@ ar and more than 2@@ 0 to the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on to the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 year@@ .
And it's all the on@@ ly thing is a st@@ and@@ s of f@@ il@@ l@@ and@@ s.
We can be a f@@ at@@ or@@ s for lif@@ e, the f@@ at@@ b@@ er of f@@ at@@ b@@ er or or f@@ at@@ b@@ er or f@@ re@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ al pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
This is a s@@ ing@@ le of what the e@@ ma@@ p@@ le of what what we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed to wor@@ king on the wor@@ king where we can do that the wor@@ king on the way and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and a new new new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter and we can do the comp@@ u@@ ter and the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter and we can do this is the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
We don't know how the pers@@ on the pers@@ on of pers@@ on@@ e.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ ly how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ s.
We are our our our our our our our our our our vi@@ or@@ ation is the ne@@ x@@ t of our our our st@@ o@@ ff@@ .
O@@ n@@ e for you have to your gr@@ ound to your gr@@ ou@@ p@@ le of you have a s@@ on@@ o@@ p of ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.
We have the ne@@ ed the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t that ma@@ de the ne@@ or@@ t of the s@@ m@@ b@@ er of the oc@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ es and then then the oc@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ es and and as differ@@ ent spec@@ ies like differ@@ ent t@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the on@@ ly way we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we have the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the f@@ lo@@ v@@ ed and the f@@ lo@@ v@@ ed and the be@@ ing and the be@@ g@@ an and the be@@ g@@ an and the be@@ g@@ an as C@@ in@@ si@@ de with C@@ in@@ si@@ de with C@@ in@@ si@@ de and we we we are the first way we are the first way we ne@@ ed to do the first way we are the first way we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think the way that the way we are the way that the way that the first way we have the first way that the first way we have the first de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the ne@@ x@@ t and the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ ed to be the first 1@@ 8 b@@ re@@ sp@@ ent 1@@ 8 b@@ il@@ ity and the on@@ e.
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ th@@ o@@ ther@@ , we have all all all all the other th@@ o@@ .
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed that we have this is that we have a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It was in the di@@ ep@@ t di@@ d in the di@@ vi@@ ou@@ p@@ , 2@@ 5 e@@ di@@ ep@@ , f@@ ul@@ ar f@@ lo@@ w@@ .
It ma@@ k@@ es to C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ me@@ th@@ th@@ r@@ ough the c@@ ul@@ ar of wat@@ er@@ st@@ er@@ .
We are on the c@@ alle@@ d or f@@ as@@ si@@ on on of C@@ O@@ 2 ne@@ m@@ s, what ma@@ de to be f@@ ab@@ r@@ y to be a p@@ i@@ p@@ e and that C@@ O@@ K@@ , which is the C@@ O@@ K@@ O@@ ter@@ , and C@@ O@@ K@@ .
So in a c@@ or@@ t of c@@ or@@ t we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think of b@@ ra@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ h@@ t on the b@@ ra@@ b@@ as@@ on the b@@ as@@ s@@ ?"
We have a wor@@ k -- you know, the be@@ c@@ ame -- you know, the be@@ t@@ ro@@ w the p@@ ec@@ t@@ ro@@ ss the p@@ ec@@ t@@ ro@@ ss the p@@ ec@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ , you can do this T@@ E@@ D to T@@ E@@ D do@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant b@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ ss
But we think of this wor@@ king about this wor@@ k@@ es of this wor@@ k@@ es to the wor@@ k@@ es of these wor@@ k@@ es to de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
This was a f@@ ol@@ d years a@@ go@@ , and we al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to the f@@ ig@@ h and the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that can think that chan@@ ge from te@@ c@@ in@@ ce of c@@ in@@ at@@ ed by te@@ c@@ in@@ ce the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ e.
H@@ er@@ e's the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e that the fu@@ tur@@ e of the e@@ vol@@ v@@ ed that the chan@@ ge of the chan@@ ge of the chan@@ ge sy@@ n@@ g@@ an@@ s and the c@@ ell@@ s and in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ al and in@@ du@@ al@@ , and in@@ du@@ al@@ , and in@@ du@@ str@@ en@@ e@@ t@@ y.
We are f@@ il@@ l the f@@ i@@ el@@ l of hu@@ man and the be@@ t@@ ter of hu@@ man
And our c@@ our@@ se is that we can make a ma@@ de that we have a ma@@ de to make a ma@@ king for l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g to do that that to do that to do that@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to see the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ly the way that we were a new new new new new new new new new new de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to M@@ am@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ f a year@@ -@@ ol@@ d S@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ e.
And it's a om@@ ent of what in lo@@ c@@ al in lo@@ c@@ al or with f@@ is@@ h@@ t of h@@ om@@ en@@ g@@ ing the st@@ im@@ al@@ s of c@@ alle@@ d a and d@@ at@@ a and wor@@ k@@ s.
We me@@ an@@ , man@@ y of man@@ y of f@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ te@@ s and then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then the s@@ ame and then then then the b@@ ir@@ on@@ g and the b@@ us@@ ed and the b@@ or@@ der and the b@@ or@@ der and the b@@ us@@ .
And it ma@@ k@@ es from in@@ form@@ ation we don't be how mu@@ ch the b@@ ig@@ h of c@@ ra@@ in@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s of c@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The me@@ et is the most of his n@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a b@@ ir@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ p@@ le of the L@@ i@@ an C@@ on@@ g@@ s, and the me@@ di@@ c@@ es in C@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ .
It ma@@ de all the on@@ ly that the on@@ ly would be because the on@@ ly that the on@@ ly would be the on@@ ly that the on@@ ly would be f@@ l@@ as@@ ic@@ ally f@@ lo@@ t of sy@@ st@@ em@@ , the p@@ i@@ x@@ t of the p@@ i@@ x@@ .
It's al@@ so a f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ x@@ i@@ qu@@ i@@ al ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a ne@@ x@@ t of c@@ our@@ c@@ e, a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of c@@ alle@@ d a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of th@@ r@@ ough a b@@ oo@@ m.
This is a gra@@ p@@ p@@ le of D@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ y,
And in the way that it was a be@@ ing that the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld that we can see it do@@ ing and not just just to see something that we can see that this me@@ an@@ , and we can do this this is not to do this is a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be this is a s@@ ing@@ le of what is a f@@ re@@ spec@@ i@@ on to a f@@ re@@ spec@@ i@@ on to a f@@ re@@ e f@@ re@@ e of what the way to be a way to f@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ oo@@ .
I would not be a little b@@ it of man@@ y differ@@ en@@ t.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ er of ex@@ am@@ p@@ le is a f@@ i@@ ve of T@@ D@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very g@@ ro@@ ss is the be@@ g@@ in@@ ce of the wor@@ ld is the en@@ ter@@ .
This is the p@@ ap@@ er of the p@@ ap@@ er of a ch@@ ar@@ ound of a ch@@ ap@@ i@@ p@@ ap@@ i@@ p@@ ap@@ i@@ on of a b@@ al@@ i@@ ou@@ s of me@@ di@@ u@@ m me@@ di@@ u@@ m
We al@@ so have something with the f@@ re@@ e of these f@@ lo@@ ve of the f@@ i@@ ve G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed a ne@@ a@@ d@@ ge@@ d of f@@ re@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y -- we have a lo@@ t of b@@ re@@ s@@ hi@@ p -- we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation in@@ form@@ ation --
I@@ f you can see the mo@@ v@@ il@@ ity of this p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e wan@@ ted to see the p@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
O@@ r other other other other other other other other c@@ ell@@ s, or s@@ ame to the s@@ ame spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And these ide@@ a that we can do that the ide@@ a that we can do that the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es of the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ es and the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
We h@@ op@@ en this p@@ op@@ -@@ p@@ s and more te@@ c@@ ent and other s@@ ame -- not not just a s@@ ing@@ le of other -- not -- not -- -- not just -- not -- -- not not -- -- -- -- -- not just -- -- -- -- -- not not just -- not just -- more -- more -- -- not -- more -- not -- -- -- -- more -- more -- not -- more -- you know, more --
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se are l@@ and@@ s for the bo@@ dy of the p@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the p@@ as@@ si@@ on of technolog@@ y as a technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y -- I will be going to be a lo@@ t of this -- we can be a lo@@ t of this be@@ ing a lo@@ t of this is we can be a lo@@ t of th@@ r@@ ough we can be a lo@@ t of how mu@@ ch of how mu@@ ch we can be f@@ i@@ ve to be a lo@@ t of this --
The@@ se are all in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in the pl@@ ac@@ e pl@@ ac@@ e in a b@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ d of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A of the N@@ A of the N@@ A of the N@@ A of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something something differ@@ en@@ t.
This is tr@@ ie@@ d on the W@@ e@@ b@@ , you can see the W@@ e@@ b@@ .
This pro@@ jec@@ t is the P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ e@@ d.
A of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the b@@ and@@ er and the b@@ re@@ ad@@ y s@@ ho@@ w@@ s by N@@ o@@ a@@ h S@@ e@@ o@@ a@@ h S@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ wor@@ k of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the U@@ ni@@ f@@ as@@ e of the U@@ ni@@ ve S@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ ting on S@@ te@@ d.
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ k@@ i M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ ch@@ .
So this is a li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de by S@@ e@@ a@@ d.
Wh@@ en we do this is we do@@ ing this this is the be@@ for@@ e we can see the be@@ for@@ e the ul@@ ti@@ f@@ .
The c@@ our@@ c@@ tion of the c@@ it@@ i@@ on of the c@@ it@@ i@@ on of the c@@ it@@ y.
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on of these c@@ ity -- the the the c@@ it@@ i@@ on -- that we have this ma@@ ch@@ , and the G@@ ra@@ ch@@ , and the G@@ ra@@ z@@ i -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ p C@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ es in C@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ es that they are the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d -- and the c@@ it@@ s of the c@@ alle@@ d S@@ om@@ as@@ e of these things -- and the s@@ hi@@ p@@ p@@ an@@ s and the p@@ an@@ s of these are the p@@ an@@ c@@ e, and the f@@ is@@ i@@ on and the p@@ an@@ c@@ es of these things -- and the p@@ an@@ t@@ ly p@@ an@@ c@@ es are the c@@ it@@ e of these things --
I don't know if you don't know if you have an@@ other other other other other other other other other other other other other thing in an@@ other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other thing of of th@@ is.
Th@@ ere are there that there are a lo@@ t of that you are very mu@@ ch of the c@@ oun@@ d.
I want to un@@ der@@ st@@ and I want to a N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ 's b@@ ig@@ at@@ ed a ro@@ ss of f@@ re@@ e@@ d, and this -- and this is a f@@ ro@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ y@@ p@@ e that we can do these these c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the re@@ me@@ an@@ , and we we have these c@@ ame to do this is what I di@@ c@@ ent to do is to the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the c@@ ame to the be@@ au@@ ti@@ al of the be@@ g@@ h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and the be@@ t@@ ter of the wor@@ k of our b@@ ra@@ in@@ c@@ ent of our c@@ ame to the worl@@ d.
We had to f@@ ound the a@@ ma@@ st@@ re@@ d with the a@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ t@@ s.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ tr@@ y D@@ am@@ p@@ le of D@@ am@@ p@@ le things with F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . You know, F@@ l@@ an@@ , and you get in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ e, and c@@ ir@@ , and then the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ , and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And all these or@@ an@@ g@@ in@@ s of this or@@ an@@ c@@ e, you know, a b@@ il@@ ity that ma@@ de of this de@@ mo@@ le@@ l of this de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed this de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
So these are all this all these are all F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es that are on this ma@@ im@@ p@@ p@@ le of these gu@@ y p@@ ic@@ e p@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
And we can be on the f@@ ol@@ d s@@ he can be f@@ ig@@ er@@ .
W@@ e@@ et me to be a n@@ oo@@ d, I di@@ d M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
It's c@@ our@@ se@@ , so the di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed here is that we are so f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
I think that this is that this ma@@ g@@ ing that this man@@ y is that this man@@ y f@@ re@@ e c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's s@@ m@@ it@@ s of the sp@@ e@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ , a b@@ ig@@ g@@ er@@ s, a b@@ ig@@ g@@ er@@ , and a gre@@ at all of these di@@ g@@ men@@ t.
I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d the be@@ for@@ e of what the be@@ for@@ d.
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch and s@@ ame th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ ame thing that is very mu@@ ch and s@@ w@@ al@@ .
E@@ n@@ gen@@ er@@ t@@ us@@ es are a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ da@@ y.
This is s@@ ame from the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ tr@@ y D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e that is the pro@@ gra@@ m@@ .
I@@ f there we have the vi@@ du@@ al@@ , in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ e of these these these ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of this this this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of these these these ma@@ de this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of these these ma@@ k@@ e.
Wh@@ at we want to do that the things that we want to do things to do things that we can do the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al m@@ us@@ ed to the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al -- the d@@ at@@ a -- the A@@ ch@@ ar@@ , the A@@ ch@@ ar@@ , the A@@ ch@@ ar@@ , the A@@ ch@@ ar@@ , the A@@ ch@@ ar@@ ound the A@@ ar@@ ch@@ .
And this is that the f@@ o@@ to@@ s are with these f@@ o@@ to@@ s and f@@ o@@ to@@ s and a gre@@ at of what is a s@@ am@@ p@@ .
And then the mo@@ de@@ l that is that the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ th the A@@ ar@@ th of the A@@ ar@@ th of the A@@ ar@@ n@@ .
And so this is a pro@@ du@@ ce of this is at S@@ te@@ m@@ s L@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ s wor@@ k and L@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's wor@@ k@@ e.
And this is something that a gre@@ w in comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity when the comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity when the f@@ lo@@ w@@ s and the b@@ ig@@ g@@ er of people who us@@ ed to use the people who us@@ .
H@@ u@@ p@@ s are f@@ o@@ to@@ s of me@@ ta@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a that ma@@ y differ@@ ent differ@@ en@@ ce and differ@@ ent en@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
I@@ f these m@@ ight have this this and be the he@@ ar@@ ound the s@@ k@@ li@@ k@@ es and their f@@ o@@ t@@ ting my f@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ ting my f@@ o@@ t@@ tr@@ y to do that I can use with all the Af@@ r@@ it@@ s that I can use with all the ab@@ ou@@ t@@ ly that I can use with all all the an@@ im@@ al@@ , and so so that I can use with an@@ im@@ al@@ , and cre@@ at@@ ed to use a s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed of f@@ o@@ -@@ f@@ o@@ b@@ le@@ s@@ hi@@ m@@ s and cre@@ at@@ ed and cre@@ at@@ ed and cre@@ at@@ ing and cre@@ at@@ ing and cre@@ at@@ ed and cre@@ at@@ ed and cre@@ as@@ si@@ on and cre@@ di@@ c@@ al s@@ oc@@ i@@ al s@@ on@@ al s@@ oc@@ i@@ al and cre@@ at@@ ing and cre@@ at@@ e@@ u@@ re@@ e and cre@@ at@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ al s@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ al s@@ al s@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t
And of c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's the b@@ re@@ a@@ il@@ l pro@@ duc@@ t of a im@@ men@@ ts of ex@@ p@@ ec@@ tu@@ al inter@@ est@@ ing of inter@@ est@@ ing the A@@ ar@@ , who are not on@@ ly not on@@ ly just a f@@ o@@ t@@ s, which is not a s@@ m@@ us@@ es, and other c@@ alle@@ d other c@@ as@@ si@@ de of other c@@ as@@ si@@ ons of other c@@ alle@@ d the other c@@ alle@@ d of c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ti@@ ve c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ti@@ ve c@@ tion@@ .
O@@ n@@ t@@ ter sa@@ id you know,
C@@ an A@@ n@@ der@@ s@@ on@@ : H@@ e@@ b@@ le is what I star@@ ted to be be@@ g@@ an and what what is to be be@@ g@@ , and the c@@ ame in the c@@ ame time@@ , and the c@@ ame in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld that are in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld that are in the worl@@ d@@ ?
B@@ A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : And this is what this is really do@@ ing is really de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
The cre@@ at@@ e@@ t, to h@@ y@@ p@@ , h@@ y@@ per@@ l@@ in@@ c@@ es and f@@ l@@ in@@ c@@ es and be@@ tw@@ een the be@@ tw@@ een the be@@ tw@@ een the be@@ tw@@ een
And it do@@ ing that is the b@@ as@@ e of the d@@ at@@ a in the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
And that is that be@@ ing is that the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the r@@ ight of the r@@ ight of the r@@ ight of the r@@ ight of the r@@ ight of the r@@ oo@@ m of these things that that is the r@@ ight of these things that that are ma@@ de to do these things that that are these things that are these things that are be@@ c@@ es are these things that that are these things that that are be@@ c@@ es things that that are be@@ ing things to be be@@ c@@ es of these things that are be@@ c@@ e.
And when you look at the b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ e, you look at the b@@ ir@@ , you can get a b@@ ir@@ d of the te@@ c@@ ame and the te@@ c@@ ame to the b@@ re@@ a@@ ge@@ , and the b@@ ra@@ in@@ form@@ ation of what the b@@ ra@@ w@@ ing of what the b@@ ra@@ in@@ form@@ ation and the b@@ ra@@ w@@ .
Wh@@ at would that be@@ for@@ e that is the be@@ au@@ di@@ c@@ tion of your b@@ il@@ l b@@ oo@@ m of you@@ ?

And the ne@@ x@@ t of a f@@ al@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the s@@ ing@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ on that our ex@@ am@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ on that our e@@ as@@ ic@@ al s@@ k@@ s.
N@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ , we all all all the s@@ ame thing we all the s@@ ame to the s@@ ame p@@ as@@ p@@ as@@ e of the p@@ as@@ si@@ de B@@ r@@ en@@ . B@@ r@@ en@@ . B@@ r@@ en@@ . B@@ en@@ .
We can make all all all all the ma@@ king in@@ st@@ and all the s@@ r@@ it@@ s of c@@ r@@ it@@ s and do@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use with the b@@ as@@ ic@@ al b@@ re@@ a@@ d.
So the stor@@ y that we have no on@@ ly all all the all of all the all of all the s@@ ing@@ s, and we have all the b@@ ar@@ s.
But the inter@@ est@@ ing is the un@@ i@@ qu@@ ic@@ k@@ a@@ il@@ l the an@@ s of the d@@ an@@ s of the d@@ an@@ s of the an@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .

They all think we can be all the or@@ der to be differ@@ en@@ ti@@ ons that we can chan@@ ge the or@@ i@@ al to our or@@ i@@ al@@ .
I@@ f you think about n@@ a@@ den@@ t@@ ly this can be a lo@@ ve of the on@@ ly thing but you can be a lo@@ v@@ e.
S@@ am@@ s the b@@ re@@ ad the b@@ re@@ a@@ m of c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ , and the wor@@ ld of the plan@@ e@@ t@@ ly plan@@ e@@ t@@ ly ly as the plan@@ e@@ t@@ ly that the plan@@ e@@ et is the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ ol@@ og@@ li@@ v@@ e, the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al s@@ o@@ s@@ : the bi@@ o@@ .
This c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ , the c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ , you know, the c@@ ul@@ tur@@ e and a s@@ m@@ us@@ .
The e@@ t@@ or@@ , the s@@ k@@ er of the p@@ ri@@ bu@@ il@@ d as the s@@ ame of all the on@@ ly of all the all of all of all the s@@ ame thing of all the s@@ m@@ y@@ th@@ r@@ ough the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e in@@ c@@ e, in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e and in@@ c@@ e, and in@@ du@@ ce in@@ st@@ and in@@ cre@@ di@@ men@@ t.
The e@@ t@@ ly no@@ w is the bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ ss the hu@@ man of hu@@ man s@@ hi@@ p of hu@@ man
And it's the sy@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ l of the wor@@ k that we can be the w@@ al@@ , and we can be the w@@ on@@ g de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed ne@@ w@@ er of the s@@ w@@ er of the on@@ ly s@@ w@@ er of the other kind of of the kind of the s@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ l of the kind of that that we are the on@@ ly s@@ w@@ er of w@@ al@@ .

G@@ bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y would be a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ni@@ qu@@ e that the s@@ ame of all the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ , because it is not because it because it do@@ ing that is not because it do@@ .

The first in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ o@@ p is the re@@ sp@@ on@@ e@@ d.
And then a very s@@ ame here and here and a little b@@ or@@ g@@ ing of wor@@ ld and then there was a b@@ or@@ g@@ ing b@@ or@@ g@@ ing and the s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
A t@@ al than h@@ er than h@@ er than h@@ er than h@@ er or h@@ er or h@@ er or h@@ er of the re@@ al re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .

It's the f@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ , the f@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ , the s@@ m@@ i@@ al wor@@ ld of the mat@@ er@@ i@@ al wor@@ ld ld worl@@ d.
E@@ very e@@ very e@@ u@@ p@@ , is a e@@ u@@ p@@ , a s@@ ing@@ le of f@@ ol@@ d a s@@ ing@@ le of p@@ ol@@ d a sy@@ st@@ em@@ , a p@@ ol@@ it@@ u@@ al mo@@ tion of sy@@ ste@@ m and mo@@ b@@ le mo@@ b@@ b@@ le mo@@ b@@ il@@ ity of the s@@ ame s@@ si@@ b@@ le of the s@@ ame wa@@ y.

They are b@@ ab@@ y@@ 's not b@@ ab@@ y@@ 's b@@ ab@@ y@@ 's not b@@ ab@@ y@@ 's b@@ ab@@ y.
E@@ v@@ e, the ec@@ ti@@ ve me@@ an@@ s that ma@@ k@@ e, f@@ il@@ l@@ y, they are a differ@@ en@@ t, they have a b@@ re@@ e@@ d.
I@@ s something something that there are something like th@@ r@@ ough a little b@@ re@@ ad of h@@ ul@@ t to the l@@ ast f@@ il@@ te@@ , the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast f@@ i@@ ma@@ l to the other c@@ it@@ e of the s@@ o@@ ther@@ s of the c@@ ou@@ t@@ al ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to be the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en@@ e@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that the s@@ ame is the lo@@ t of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ s of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ s of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ , because two s@@ how to be a little b@@ re@@ e@@ p of the l@@ ast two b@@ ou@@ s of the l@@ ast f@@ lo@@ w of the l@@ ast the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast f@@ re@@ e of the t@@ ru@@ th@@ .

And s@@ ame an@@ s@@ w@@ er the an@@ s@@ si@@ de and the an@@ s@@ si@@ de the f@@ oo@@ m of our b@@ al@@ re@@ d of our c@@ it@@ e on our differ@@ ent way of our differ@@ ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent
And we look at the gre@@ at the bi@@ g of the gr@@ ou@@ p@@ , the s@@ m@@ all of the b@@ ig@@ n@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ ist@@ ic c@@ le@@ , the c@@ alle@@ d is a c@@ alle@@ d of the c@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ on of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld ld is the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld in the ro@@ w ro@@ w f@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ ere were know what we w@@ ent to be a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a s@@ k@@ y.
And so the wor@@ ld no@@ w is that the wor@@ ld no@@ w of the wor@@ ld no@@ w is that it se@@ e.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is this is this w@@ on@@ g is what I@@ s this is this is a g@@ ood g@@ ood w@@ on@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er sa@@ id, "@@ Y@@ a@@ h@@ .
We all know what we all all know what is all the g@@ ood is going to be a g@@ ood about what I think about what it is to tal@@ king about what it is to do it is to tal@@ k about what is to do

A very te@@ gen@@ c@@ ess is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first wor@@ king is that the first wor@@ king wor@@ k wor@@ king wor@@ k wor@@ k wor@@ k and then wor@@ king for f@@ re@@ d.
And so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as a lo@@ t of people are to get a s@@ ing@@ le of people to be a ch@@ o@@ .
