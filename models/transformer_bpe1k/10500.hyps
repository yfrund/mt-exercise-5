And I think of the two dia's two dia's to show that the police of the last year that the last three million years of years of the last three million of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent called the last 40 percent cent of the U.S.
But this is actually the represent of this specific problem because it doesn't the disease of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this particular problem because it didn't the disease of this particular problem because it is not the disee.
The ice is on the North Pole, in the certain the certain the clopping heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crimply in the rooms.
The next dia that I show I show is a version of what the last ast 25 years of what the last 25 years of the last 25 years of what happened in the last 25 years of what happened to happened to happened to happened to happened to show.
The permanenise is done in rood.
As you seee, it looks at dark it out from dark basically.
That's the year, is the equired in the winter.
And it is in the rooms in the six.
The permanence of the permanence or parents, or parently, is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body.
In 25 years is the one of this is the 25 years of this is going to this this.
And that's a problem because the wors worn around the North IJssea bigh ready and there was a very big high of high heated around the North of cool designed around the designed around meth.
Formous of the totale of the totale of the totale of the totale of the together, that would be able to depensive the course of the capitys.
In some understand in the eep, in Alaska borrelt methane on the water.
And the true winter Professor Katey Walter of University of University of Alaska different of the University of the University of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the Universit
Wh! And it's OK. The question is echter or we will be be going to be able to be be.
A reason for that, is that this enormous Greenland from the normous Greenland from the normous.
This is a smell aterrivi.
The water than ever ship.
This is the Kangerlusual suavier in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea seespipictures because it country to be the place where it is the place come.
These stroms take flight to be flight to it.
And then the other side of the planet, on the South pool, invented the largest ice of the planet.
And Africopen maand scientists that the whole continent that the whole continent now is a negative seeds.
More specific is the ice of the South of the South pool of the South pool of the South purpoints, with some of the waters.
The whole continent seems for six meter, like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after the two after new this, that are new mers, which are new mers, which are now a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the helps of his drop of the world.
In the Andes, is this glass the bron of drinkwater for this city.
There are more stromes.
But when they disappearing it dreams it drop the drive water.
In California was a four-40 percent in the snow pak of the Sierra.
It's really in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This world, the world, dreamed dreaming to a dramatic styced to a dramatic buries.
And the number of natural about the whole world is incredible and never seeing with an incredible and never seed.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the last 30 years of the last 30 years
This patterns is full increated one.
If you look at the point of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton of CO2 hours of CO2 hours.
25 mike a ton every day in our ocean, at the eystical area of Stille Ocean from the Stille Ocean ast, and every side of the Indian inside of the Indian inent, there is a draggetting in the ocean.
The only big causes of the Earth, really, named the Earth, which is the burning of photographs.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the big problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest stoters, sames.
And there was a pretty more still to build a lot more still centrals.
But we see a crice.
These are the citied countrales of the building was annuled in the last years, and where big alternative alternative alternative alternatives were proposed in the last of the building.
There is a political stributtting in our country.
The city's cool, and oil industree 250 million dollars from the scary of the scale of the scale of promots, which is a testing tribuildle.
That is something about something about something about something about this.
And the number of the number of the number of the cure of billion literally cooling cools of believed in Tennesse,
You probably have the probably in the news.
This is the one after one after one after one after America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertist of the country in the Kerst was the Kerst was death.
Video: "Frosty the curry is a blice, operator, operated number of the cure of char.
He's fluence in America, and he sare in America, and he was the economy for that our economy.
Frosty the currency with the day becomes with the day scune.
He's depended and certain and working their benefit."
Here's a big comes a big part of the city's cool in West Virginia of the city.
The biggest miner of the country is the big based of Massey Coal.
Video: Dong Blanguship say, "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of a bit from a bit of a bit of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our seeing for our seeing threating for our seeing threat.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to be a gigantially to the both of the spire of the light of the light and the represently the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of cities.
Feity, is not sance.
We think it's a son that it's scone -- and it's certain.
So, you don't have a sorder about climate change about climate change.
Let me only about it.
Video: Acure cool, you have a lot about heard a lot about heard.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern modern cool.
Fantastic! The machines are best what law.
But that's the sound of schone cools of schone cools technology.
And thanks the fact that the fact that the burning of cities, one of the most important thing that the earth of the Earth is change the remarkable of the Earth is change the remarkable of the equates that you see here.
Look at around the wome of the scone cools of today.
Al Gore: Eindress the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative in the area of national security of national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the national seclimate crisis.
The reason for all these things, is our dependence of phodence of photos, as fiuile class, as fired office and inportunity.
But now is a durfree to be a durfishing to be this.
Forore America 100 percent scale electricity, in 10 years of the 10 years
A plan to get America to the work on the work on the work of the earth of the Earth.
And eventually a solution that is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the lattace.
Video: Stem: It's going to be America resources.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of the pridence of our dependence of olded animate fuel to do seeing our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And so you know, 2: New investments, to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tiday to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is a old African speakwish that says, "If you want to be yet you're going to be all of that.
If you want to go away, you know, you're going to samen."
We have to go away, and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I really, to come back with a hold about how that machine power.
So I did. For degenes that are not been the LHC is the largest scientific experiment experiment in the scientific experiment in the counters, 27 kilometers.
It has to be the countries that are along that were less than a billion of billion done the universe of the universe of 600 million time.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors that I mean, the ATLATLATLASS.
Spectacular photo from ATLASSpectribuilt in the scale of ATLASS.
And in 10 september last year we have the machine.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That sare a party for a party in the controlly.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the LHC and with the LHC and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the detector of the detector of the detector of the first particles of the first particles that is really around the first particle of the first particle of the first particle that is actually the LHC C do, and with the HC, and the picture of the LHC, and the HC, and the LHC, and the HCom, which is a photograph of the LHCHCCCCome of the photest par, and with a p, and b, and b, which is b, and b, and was was was was b, and b, and b, and b, and b, and f, and b, and the HCure of the retri,
And with other words, when we saw that photograph on 10 September wouldn't know that the machine works, which is a huge winning is a huge excition is a huge consider.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of Google and saw the Internetpage and saw the Internetpage and saw the Internetpage and saw the Internetpage and saw the Internetpage and saw it was so the Internetpage and I didn't know if this is the Internet went to Google w.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this gold with this gold.
And that drags 13 thousand thousand amper room the machines of the power.
The engineers are going to be able to say, "Not this is too tally tribe."
They can do that because they can do superperature are superature temperature temperature of temperature to be superature to be superature superature that are superature to be superature superature to be superature that superaturs.
So on miles in 271 grad, the space between the girls, that can drags that drags that drawise between the good between the space between the space between the space between the space between the goods.
In one of the next between the next thousand magnets of thousands of the LHC, sat a constructive.
And then the wire was something that was there there was a electric wearing thousand every each of thousand ample of the 13 thousand ample of the before thousand ample of the same thouts.
This was the results.
This is still indrugs when you realized that magnets more than 20 ton that magnets more than 20 ton the 30 percentimeter were decided of the percentimeter were deployed to be 30 percentimeter that magnets were in the magnets more than 20 ton the realize that magnets are basically inpressive you realize that magnets are basically realize you realious of the realized to be realized to be a realize that that that magine.
We deside about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of it.
We have all them when we all have parts.
Now, they're back on away.
Eind might be the LHC weeks will be intact.
We will expect him and we expect to measure and in you, so we can go to the expect with the exciting of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, that have incredibate the debate of the debate of science of science the value of science before research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so much that we go to before we go to the LHC.
I think of the last words on the English science Humphy Davy, Davy, Davy, designed the depended experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous Faraday, this is so dangerous of the human being that are not five our design, that we are not finitions, that we are not finitive the design, and design that we are not design the design, and design, and the complearn that we dict design in the lassionate that we discn in the lase of the design design was design is not be ded experive excated the lase of the last to be design arristristristrifitive experive experive experive experive experive experi
Thank you!
I would start to ask with you to ask to your children to your children you play with block with block with block with block with block with block with you.
And then you discovered how you had to be able to understand how to be able to the basically problems of the surface of the enomineering with the counters of space relations.
And Rutell insight? And because with the world because with the world to understand of the world to understand it.
If a information of inspired by the physical interaction with the physical interaction with objects -- sames, with my advisition and my mediction, Jeevanithi -- what we use -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use -- what we use to use a computer of that we would use to be a fingertains to a fingle to defingertain and we can refinger to be definger to defist with a fingle to increate with the individual with the information with the inside of the information with a fingerith, and we can fect fect fist fist fisiree designital fical fulating fical fical fical ficionsionsions.
and we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to orders.
This question of this so we decided to look like answer to look for the answer of Siftables.
Cort samental is a Sifty a Interactive computer in a bigge.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to each other, they can feel a screen and they detect a screen and dreaming a screen and wire contact.
The nuclear is the physical handelbarity, like blocks they can be able to understand by the block of the fire.
Boven't Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that these hold parts of physical physical different of their movement of their motion of motion and even of the motion of the way we have to move them and even thought these are different new and like, there are different new and lead of leup.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftis instice to show a video to show a video to do any and others of others and others others of the backwards and others and other.
These interactive portraits are from each other.
Indience is the increated of the course, they will be interesting.
And if they are also they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the sources.
And they feel a motion and they movement.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of the interaction of these interactives of the interaction, as it was a fluid of a little bit of a little bit of a small of a little like a fluist.
In this example of the Siftables of the Siftables of the small of the small of the small of the small of the true that they become in.
And if we have governments, we go back what back.
There are some capple of capprimary for the education, represents, mathematics with language, mathematics that we want to be people the possibility that we want to be able to see things that is to try to see the possible of the possible.
And here, I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci realized by a simple of a simple know.
Here's a spoke a speak between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in any around a wanted to be a limits on every Siftable, and ddrows are controlled in a words.
And after about 30 seconds, it is the crips of the conditions, and different new series of letters with bities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I think it to make it out and a video of it.
They were really really, it was a bit of it.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people are almost people almost people almost of these people are needed to have a instructions of the most interesting things that people have need to have a instructions of the most interesting things that people are almost of these people are almost interesting is that people almost of these people are almost interesting is that people have needed not have to be able to have needesign that people
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they should do is do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our youngst base.
And it seems to the Siftables wouldn't have the Siftables well.
For him was just blocks.
Here's a interactive painting a interactive paintings.
We wanted to learn a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstreate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftack with that coarea with that cow.
Here's the son the son come.
Video: The son comes to it.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The oranin.
God da! Yeah!
And through the Siftables and the name, and the name can put the careker of the carea -- Video: Wllet -- Video: Wlly.
DM: and his own story tell.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a hold with a high.
and he decided how it it it walks.
Video: The cat is flying away.
DM: The last example that I will show Is a synthesizer and Is a synthesizer and live music that we have developed to developed a sound product a sound product like the lead, bass and drue.
And every has been four different variations that you can use to be able to do any any of the variations of it.
These happy in leage Siftables in Siftables so that you can be increated the pattern of the pattern of the pattern.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leage Siftly Sift-controlled effects like reason of the patterns and filter.
They are to a sound sound and sound by can't sound to can.
And farther the along effects like tempo and following on the whole pattern of the pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead place in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two SSiftables, to a extra extra read of extra lead.
Now, I place the basline line is the basic.
Video: Do you feed what slaghtwork on the work.
Video: And I can put the filter of the filter of the filter of the prage of the effect of live to influence.
Video: I can cell it a cell cells of the opportunity.
Video: Do you cope the filter of the filter for what is expression.
Video: I can rerepresently rearound the pattern of the play.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, the corter and build corter and corter corter and cortinue like I want.
And with the ended of the dimmms of the following Siftory Siftack to can.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of the passion of new people, of new people, which are depended in the way that are depended on the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of edition with some of the design that we develop the developing of the developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is that this is that this is the attention is that this is a very new generation with digital media, which is the information with digital media, which the information like the information like we wanted to be the information like we wanted to teach the world to our world is the information that I want to be the information to our world to our world is
Thank you from hear.
I look at it to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you with you.
I write write.
Books is my work, but also much more than that.
My life live long life and I don't think that ever happened to change that ever change that is going to change that ever change to change that ever change to change that ever change of the write life and I don't think that ever happened to change that ever change to change the way that is not going to change and I don't think that ever change of the write life.
And yet there is unlike, unlike, and career in my life and career and career with my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work in my life and career is a lononly.
And it started to a book, I wrote unlike, a memoil of a memoil of the course, Biddle, Biddle, that very exciting the whole work the whole work about and a international destribuilt world and a internation.
The really, people are always to mean, and always have to be able to be dam.
And what -- you know, -- you know, called --
People come to me and ask to me and ask you to me, "Ben you don't have to be able to eventually that you can ever be event?
Ben you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a book of the people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And you don't have any bang there?"
And you know, the tristest stated.
Of course, that would be very crame, I remember that I was 20 years ago, I was a teendly -- I was told that I wanted to be a told that I wanted to be a teends.
And people said, "Ben you don't have to be success success success is going to get success succes?
Do you don't have to be able to representation to such through through through this?
And you don't have to be able to this work on this work without that there is ever been a bit of a broken and that you have a broken of your broken dreaming with your bitters of your bitters of fal?"
Something in that strekking.
And in the short is my answer on that question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are called called
Always all time.
But I also much other things that bang, you don't want to know that for all of it.
For very simply example, and other entire things.
But what is being to write myself the last time that are the last time that anything that anything that anything that angling angling the last time that are from.
Is it rational?
Is it to be a lot of that somebody is to be able to work for the work for the work for the work for the world?
What is so basically so we creative processes that we make the effects of the effects of the effects of the minds, something like to work all of the work on the top.
And I think I was showing my father. He was shift to remember that there was in the 40 years that he was remember in the 40 years that he was not a bang or he was not a bang for it to him.
And so of "Yohn, how is the chemistry with your chemist?"
No, so was not about it.
And to be able to be the faipictures have not the century by the century of the century of the century of manical depressive along depressive alones for a piece of ear.
Sche writing that have such a reputation.
Not only the write of people have the reputation of people have the reputation of the reputation is a bit of the reputation is a bit of the reputation is a reputting human.
Look at the 20th of the dodental dodental under the most magnifical creative minists of the 20th century.
And many of the young, failable to do through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through thing.
And even the same thing that are not moord to be able to be under their gave cooks.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer:
That's pretty what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of the kind of looking at the kind of the kind of the kind of op.
We all have the same thing to have heard and have the sources of all accepted.
The based is that creativity is that creativity increativity is increated with lishing and that is a artists to eventually infinite to call of the eventually decided to count of the day.
And so I want to ask anyone here today with that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea to question: you ask with that idea to ask with that idea to asionly question: you question: you can ask with that idea to that,
Do you know, OK?
I think I think about that, I think about it is not a pretty not pretty pretty pretty though.
I think it is the screaminivity.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century.
We can creative minds a lot of better to life.
I know it would be a few of my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to the dark of the dark of life.
Seach the fase where my career in my career in my career now is now in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career now.
And it's a took young, amper safeedge, amper safety you.
I can work in the decades of four decades work.
And the probably will be the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside that extraordinary successful book.
We are with friends with friends of each other, so I can probably light my grandands of success of behind sucess of behind me.
Yeah, what a idee!
If you think about the characters you know, for you, for you're going to be able to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love with the work with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I think of love with the work where I love with the work.
The question is: "Hoe?"
And after long after a lusion to the conclusion that I can just by write with write in the process of inbuild in the process inbuild in the process inbuild inbuild the conclusion.
I have to see a securry a secure of the piece between myself and my governmental anything to the reactions for the reactions of the future publishing public public public public public to the write of the future of the future of the future of the write of the write of the
I have the last year as a way to ways to ways that.
I think of the history and have done and have deeping me and have a better way to see if another other deployed to see or anothers have been a better way to help creative people to help creative to the emotional complicative process.
My search has been braw me braw me to the old Gries.
Lop, because it's a long and increated story.
In the old Gred and Romeins and Romeins believity was not that creativity was the people display of itself.
Men believed that creativity is a good partty was, which was an increativity, unknowledge and unknow.
The Great the Greeks of crease of crease of creativity "demonen."
And we believe that he believed that he had a demon that he had a demp him that he did.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And in the called a called a courage creative creative spirit was a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius, a bunch of characters.
In their promise was a genion was a genial godddress the murs of the pure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the artist, the geniusion of the geniusion.
And the way, he gave shape to the work.
Brilliant! That's precise that I had the first about the psychological protection of your work.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection of the artist, to example.
If you work bread, you know, you wouldn't have all the ear.
Everybody knew that is a unvisible that a invisible genius.
You know, you know, it was represent you, it doesn't just to you.
Everybody is that you have a predicated incredice.
Lange time is that before the Wests creativity was creativity became
And then the Renaissance, and everything about it.
There is a very new idea: the individual people, the individual people's the middle point of the universe and mysterious and mysteries.
No space for mystical responsible of the goddnamed of the goddness world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People people creativity creativity completely from the individual came out of individual came out of the individual came out of individual full of individual fully from the individual of the individual fully from the individual fully full out of the individual.
And for the first time in history was there about artists artists was a geniused that they were not enimagine.
I have to say that I have to be a big fail.
And to believe one person, one person, one of a single individual, he she was the essentially she's the equal mystery of the eware the ewonder, the equating mystery creative and the known of the equal human psystems is something to responsibility for a fragal human psyches.
Anybody ask you the slike, the slike.
Egos are breases to gigantic proporties and they are incredividual.
And I think this drug 500 years of the last 500 years of artists cots.
And if it is so think, and I think is the question is the question is the question is the question is the question.
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship of the relationship between the human and creative mysterious?
Maybe not to it.
Well light 500 years rational home in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speaking playe.
And probably the audience of people who have been realed in the audience of the idea that equiple of the idea that equates of the feedings of the work of the work of the work of artists of the work of artists to inspirat.
It seems to measure you all in that.
And I asked me it to it.
Why don't you ththis?
Why would we not have thought that thought to be follow?
The squickly as much as a lot of the totally different capable to excitional unimagines that decided in the creative process.
Everybody that has something something has trying to create something that has try -- so in fact, so in fact, the creative process -- you know, the creative process that creative process is not always realways drow.
That sometimes the moment paranormal.
I have the wish the wish American discovered Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone of discovere.
And she is animals in the next of life write write them.
She told me about her jeudged on the plator of Virginia.
Somes, if they were the work was working on the work was a close she was a close to the close of the close of the country.
The was, so, so, you know, a big wave wave to a big wave light air.
And so, the country to the country about the country to her her it.
And she feel that the ground under under her foot that the foot of the foot and makes that her on that her on that her life.
They went to home, followed by the close and they had to see so quickly as quickly, and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper than the closed to show.
When it was close to writer her waves was that her only the only thing to write it on the same thing to write it on the same through her the one.
Sometimes she was not enough.
Then right, but it's not taken the house and right.
And in the moments schools schools the close of the fired of the fired -- in her word -- in her words -- in her direction.
And then there were a little bit -- this is I think this is the beautiful of the story -- they think they are almost of the poem -- they almost of the poem is almost mistry.
Then she was in home in search and paper and paper it by her her and paper through her and paper to hear.
Yeah, she had a potoment than a potter than a potom.
And with her other hand, so told me she told it out the close of the air.
They packed it to be close to be close in her body back in her body in her body in her body in her bodies the operate.
In those case came the close of close that came in the same through the paper of paper and in the cordinary of the follow.
And when I heard that high-day -- what I thought -- what is so dedecided my creative process of creative process of the creative proces!
And so my creative process is not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a music, which every day on the same time, which is the same time, and swell, and swell, and sweeks and swell.
But even in that day I have been a experience I have so one of experienced so a experience of experience.
You know, the yourself is also fellow that there are creative ideas in your opbron in your opbron that you can be impossible that you can be impossible.
What is that burning for burning this?

The best contemporaine that I can think I can think about this, I can think of this is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time.
We had the him of the throw go.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is the toonce of the county of the county artists that are protect to get all the power to the understand the understand in the understand in him.
And the 190s, the 1990s.
And one day he rereason he was in Los Angeles about the speaking percent of the process of radical radical radical scale.
And as he was so representation he was a fragments.
The decided him, like inspiration that is does failable to understand cwell.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to the fasth.
But it doesn't it.
He had no paper true in itself, no tack order at ity.
The well-familion is a movement of the melowho are the melowho are the melowho are the equates of the equates me the equates of the evies.
I don't have enough, I can't do it it through no doe."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that help help the entire tale people.
And he looked at the air, and said, "Sorry horry hin, you can't see that I behind the stuff?"
"Think you to write a song can you be able to write a song of show?
If you really want to get that this lowing is you have to be later to be able to do for you.
That's not going to be anyone else didn't have a lot of fall.
And Ga buburned Cohen." And from that I love it in lost of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Cohent."
The work is working itself, with the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the known known the ddddark itself.
But the sware the creative process that creative process in him called the case of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious respon
It was to close to close the skin and leave it only crow.
And in the realized that there was no reason to do it.
It was a wonderful bizarre society of conversation between Tom and the own between Tom and the own that not entire emalso that not entire emalso that is not entire emalso that I was not really like to be a wonderful of Tom ite was be
That story has changed my way of working about the way.
I had a profound of the seems of heard.
I was in the writing of Ets, Biddle percent of Ets, Biddle.
And I mean, I mean, I mean, I show in the well.
You know, you know, you work to work and you don't want to be able to be a differences and you think it is a difference. It is book. It does book.
Not side oner bad bad of bad bad.
I wanted to do it all the project of all the project of all the project project all the project of all the project of all the project of all the project of all of the project.
And when I remember Tom that are encount of who was decided to be a power to way.
I wish of my manuscrips and directioned me to a leage to a leage of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said heard "Lister this, we know all know that if this book, is not brilliant brilliant not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop what I have.
And I can't give it.
And if you have to do it better than you've got to do this.
Snap you don't you, you're not going to be you, you're not thing.
I just write doing because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are called that are basically differently, and today for cantell."

Euws ago, there was in the North African wish together people in the North African wish to dance in the North music.
And then they were behind to the ochtends, to the ochtends.
That was always wonderful because the dances were full professionals.
But sometimes, some of some happened to be a little bit double something basically double thing.
One of those dance was transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever seen a performer.
It was as as as the time still and the dance of the dance of stape.
He didn't have anything about thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands
And the Plotation of the long leave a human beings.
In him, body under him, bottom.
A good firee hours door.
If you did something that was happened to the Dan began to class and in the class and in the croom and in the crite of the Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
Tromens, a leuck historical fact the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spanine in the currening with it.
The century is real real through the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, old one."
That hord to the day of the day still of chair.
If a artist, in Spance something like magically or magically thought, "Allah, OK, other, OK, old one, Allah, OK, ole well.
One is understand side, a glimp of God.
Prion what we need to have to be able to be able to be a lot of what we need to need it.
Lastig is the dance that the dance morning to the morning morning to discovered that he did not a dinary to the 11 hours not god-basically departtment.
And in that moment is he went to be a little bit of a little bit of the parently that well.
Maybe there will never be more ananybody God anybody are dance.
What has to the rest of his liv?
That's hard to it.
That's really really hard to be a creative to a creative mind.
But so the pinside is not to be the right.
And if you don't get the extraordinary of your extraordinary aspects of your person from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself that the most intrainditions.
And if you believe that you believe that you have a time, you have a time, of a not specificate to specificate a true of a nather specificate that you have a time.
When you are going to be able to somebody anything that they are door.
That's how to protect everything.
I was individed to me.
The last months I have a book, that book, that book, that book, is going to be a lot of a book a lot of long reason to be out.
The opulation of that illust.
And if my thought with me with me to the hold me with me, I still the same thing that you don't have to be bank. That is not ban.
That just you work.
And just the five you do, what it is.
If it is to dance the dance is thank you.
And if it is a good geniused that you're decision to decision to be able to be able to screen in the wonderful of the wonderful broke through the wonder, "Ol!
That happens to do that, but then dance through through this.
And also this, "Ol!
I think that believe I hear.
"Ol! What it is because we ever from pure human love love of the human loves of the ready of the pure of the pure of the pure human.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have the one of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can meaning and what it can meaning and discovered the new sets of genes.
We started to start a new point: we were the biology of the biology of the digitalize of the digital code to a new fase in the biology in biology in the biology and design syntheticipating of life.
So we always tried to strain.
"What is live, something that I think is something that have a lot of biologists have trying to understand on different level.
We have different benefits protection, it tried to minimal components.
We are almost 20 years on the digitalize of the digitalize it.
And when we have sequenced the human genome have sequenced the from the analog world of biology, to the computer.
Now, we try to ask life is we live live, or can we live new life create, from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of that can be able to be able to be able to be able in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory oratory oratory origin.
And we have to look at a nice or we can come to a nice or a named to be enough.
We can be in the order of hundred of the 500 or 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively relatively with the understand with the unse.
And so you know, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that is probably unliving a lived cell that would be a live.
We decided to be the only route pretty to syntheticipe this chromosing the components so that we could depp the components to deployed the components of the most fundamental questions.
And we started with questions, "Can we started a chromosing synthetim?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry moleculen that we never have never seen before we never have never seen before the chemistry of before the chemistry molecules that we never have never seen before the chemistry molecules.
And, if we can do that, a chromosside "
A chromosh is the chromosside of chemical inert.
So, our temmo of the digitalize of life is resource of life is represental eating on exponential while of life is the digitalize of life is the digitalial ready of life is the digitalize of life is the digitalize of life is represental reading.
And our entic code to write the genetic code of lowing long long long --
And our last point would be the moment would places on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethic top, tisic true of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthise of DNA very hard is very difficult.
There are thousands of monkeys in the world that little pieces in the world DNA maks, 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 percent of the world process, so loner and the deal of the world that more follow.
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts.
And this was our first power to start with the digital information of the genome Phi is Phi Exi is 174.
That's a little virus of bacteria domvirus that bacteria dom.
We designed the pieces of the foltcorrection.
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The spited part of the stuff, when we put a chemical stopping chemical stopes, and the bacteria of the genetic code the genetic code and viral particles and viral particles and viral partics.
The viral particles were sold to the cells, they were came out of the cells, they came back and done the E. coli.
I was unclearing in the ologinize with the oil industry, and I said that they are not a good show.
They laught more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation is a situation in which is the software in a biological system.
But we wanted to a lot of great.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosophim.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassetts, so that we could build the cassetts. And we could build the cassetts.
and understand what the dealing is that the dealing of a live.
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than a digital information in the computer than a digital information in the computer than a digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than you have to be understanding with digital information in the comp
And when we first first this is the first time in 1995 was the standard in 19995 was the standard of 10,000 basepares.
And I think we had a resequency of 30 folts. If we had the original sequence had not to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to star.
And part of the design is the design is design that 50 letters long long that are long with 50 letters of 50 letters to build so that they can design to build so that they can design to design so that they can design to design so that they can design to design that we need to design with the design that we have to design to be design with 5
We design unique to do unique unique to do unique unique of the design of it.
Maybe you have learn that we have the water markayes.
And I think we have a four letterly genetic code: A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, you know, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, we have a four letter.
Trio's of those letters for the letters for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a similar any clearning is for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write word to write words in thing.
And required to the courather of the course.
Some of them were telling that there were no close that there was no close to be directs.
We have this stuck that we can design them to enzymes.
There are enzyms that they repart of them and in the each other.
And we started to make it five to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters long long and you have been piece, and you have a piece of 24,000 letter, until of 24,000 letter, to 700.
In each city we have a confired of these stucks so that we could sequences so we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuy robuy robuy -- that will be a process.
We try to reach the point of automatic.
So this is a basketbal.
And so, we have the real stuffs -- more than 100,000 basepares -- more than 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow easy in E.
That is the expensive of all modern the molecular of molecular biology.
And we went to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombinations of the biology to repart by the biology to repart of DNA to repart of DNA to repart of the biology can foot together.
Here is a pretty example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus that three million radiod-million radiation to be able to change to change on can.
That you see in the bottop of the paneal, so, chromosside of the paneously certainly of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later later, exactly in each other.
There are thousands of organisms that can nake.
These organisms can completely opposed to be dread.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can be able to be able to be able to be a new aquatically environment.
NASA has tricrations that there is a lot of of of it,
Here's a dealing microphere, of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- partitely with this processes with the right design of the pieces of the pieces that we did them in design of the pieces that we did them in design that we did in the design of the molecule.
Gairly sormous that they car society.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a wone.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see with a light microscope that we can see it with a ligh.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we individual.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of people, with a clearly structure.
The molecuulated more than 300 million three million it.
If we would depended with a 10-points letter, without without of the point of the genetic code of the genetic code aded ath.
Good, how we started a chromospsphere? How do we active,
And in a virus is the frue is the clear.
And you know, a bacteria lot of inorormous.
It's simpler if you decided to eukaryots, like that, you know, the celkers and doing the celkers of the celkers and doing it is what you know.
And the bacteria of the bacteria of chromospling in the cell of the cell of the cel, but we have an completely transplace that we can activate a chromosing of a chromosside of a chromossive to a very cell and it can active.
We have a chromosing a chromosside of a microbs.
These are about as far as far as a people and mously as people and mously mouse.
We food. And we could have a genes so that we could have to be able to be able to be able to be selects.
We have the represented with enzyms to make all the eive.
It was free to be able to be in the cell when we will be able to stopped the cell of the cell of these things -- and you can probably worth -- the new chromosside of the cell of cell in the cell of cel.
We thought it would come to show it would come to develop the process that was going to developed the process of developed to develop the process that was going to be able to develop the process that he would be tried to develop the process that he would come to developed to develop the process that we were tried to develop the process that we were in the process that was going to be able to developed to developed to developing the before it would be able to developed to develop.
This is an essential evolutional evolution.
We discovered all sorts of that are a second chromosside of the chromosing or a thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the species.
People that evolution evolution is that if there is one one of the equates have not much biology to change biology meet.
There are enzyms that restriction-enzyms that are real DNA ready that are real DNA distiction.
The chromosphere, in the cell has not eed.
The cell -- the chromossive that we stopped in -- well, well.
It was expression, and the repression, and the other chromosphere, and the other chromosside of the chromosside, and we had to be able to the new chromosly with the new chromosope.
He was blue of the genes that we had in the genes that we had in the count.
And in very short time akory all the kary of the carea of the kind of the kind of of of the kind of of the new species, and changed the new kind of based in the new software in the cell that we had stop.
All of the burned changed the count of the genetic code -- when we had the genetic code was changed.
This may be clines like genomical alchemice, but we are in the software in the software DNA, to change things that fundamental DNA, to change things that are fundamental alchemicks.
And I have been a shape that this is not ship that this is not a ship -- this is pretty on 3.5 billion years of years of evolution, and I have a new version of the Camburned that we have a new version of the Camburn explosion of the Cambased on this digital design on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's clearly if you look at what you look at what it is going to be able to what it is going to be able to what it is.
We go in the six-half of six-half billion people, for the next 40 years of the next 40 years of the next 40 years of the next 40 years
And to place it in my context born in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet...
And for every of us that that in 1946; in 1940, that there are four before.
We have to food with food with the single of school, medicine, medicine, fure for the six-six-half billion billion billion billion billion of water, with the side of the sessary with the side of water, medicine, with the six-billions.
That's going to be lastig to do that.
We use five billion ton cools, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 million fees.
When we have biological processes in ogences in ogences or whether to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge process.
Then of course, all those coal-dioxide of the stributty of the stinust.
And in all of our world's discovered to discovered a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The electronics had a doing of the components, and look at the diversity that are coming out there.
We are pretty before a biological reality and our picture.
We have now dank technique synthesimagine synthesimagine called "combinatic genomics.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day chromosomes.
If you think of the reproducation of 20 million different genes or try to be able to make octase or making octon or medicine, or medicins, new vaccines, we can producers, we can change with a little bit of the last 20 years we can do more molecular than in the last 20 years of the last 20 million different than in the last 20 million different to the last 20 million different to the last 20 million different different different different to the last 20 million itor
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select selecters for life burnity, chemical or fuel productive, vaccine, faccinating.
This is a screen of what real designed designed designed where we work on the access of the world, and a new kind of the computer of the computer design of the computer design design.
We don't know how it it will see.
We know how their genetic code how their genetic code out out how their genetic code out how their genetic code out how their genetic code out how their genetic code how their genetic code out how their genetic code how their genetic code.
We are now on fourth generation now burning generation stroks.
And in the longs you have seen to ethanol a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to be from the next of the next of the sugaria to more high or different species like octanol.
But the only way that we think biology that biology can have a food price without without the food price and the screen and the screen is to read with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are understanding the way that we are designed the first of the first fours that we have the first four first generation to design in 18 months to 18 months of the design in 18 month.
And CO2 is one method -- but by our world's one method -- but by our world's discovered to be all of the world, we have all sort of other methose.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles of a five miles of cool did to temperature temperature of the depents.
It makes methane of CO2 with treated molecular waterst, waterstriers as energy bron.
We are looking at the case of CO2 can be able to take four to fired four to be fability, where that CO2 that CO2 is being back to bring this CO2 is being to bring this process to sture this process to stral this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture and the fabries, where we can be fabries, where we can be fabries, be fer to be fabried to the fabried to be fy to be fabriece, to be f, to be f, to be f, to fa feated to be fa to be five to be five to fabriecourse to be f-base
So in a short time, we think that we are in the corning that we are in the basal question question question is life?"
We have the described -- you have the skill of the petrochemical industry to replace the petrol industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, where you can do this, where it well.
A important energy broke affect of energy broke broke a important energy brow.
But we also are also to use the works, to think about faccell series of these works.
This year the group, we just just something behind the fact that behind the fact on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by teforwards of teforward vaccine.
And here you see how the future can see how the future can see the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually archea, and eventually evolukary archeas ly.
We are far away of people.
Our does to do is very certain that we make a chance to survive. That is to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you is the fundamental is the fundamental of a new technology that we have to be about a year.
And it's a environmental or on the wish or on the wish or on the county of data can work on the data can work on the data can work.
We look at many of this is a lot of digital images and can be here on the endled and decided on blinds, navigors and the sort of the sort of terrible and the sort of the sort of the wish.
And it doesn't make how much information we look at how much these collections or images.
Most of these are normal camera photographs, but this is a showing of the Library or Congress, and then in the 300 megapixely or Congress, and then in the 300 megapixely of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of
It makes not just a little bit of the prestates would be mostications of the prestations of the prestations of the prestates of pixels.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a pretty of nothing that is that.
This is a grauth house by Dicky's skold to Dickold is a head.
And to descene that it is really a depicture, and not imagination, and we do something that this is not a depicture.
Maybe this is a took a little book of a e-book.
I wouldn't example.
This is a realisticer example. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every big depicked in a part of a particular particular.
This is really the place and the experience of a real paper or a real paper or may be a scale of time, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also have done with the Guardian.
We have a need advertist of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra normal adverts.
If you see the possibilities of these car you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really be really for the percent that we can do the limits of them in the screen of them can do it in the screen.
We don't hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course, are a for the hand for the hand for a technology as a technology like this, I will not spending a technology as this, I think about this is a lot of a behavior.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
ASA picked on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is triculy now on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of the thing is Seadragon and it is a very beautiful computer-vision promove of the University promovened by the University of Washington the University of Washington University of Washington University of Washington University of the University of Washingtric promove Sed:
And Rick Smyself Research. Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we see this is what we see is that we see through the images and the multi-ti-ti-resolution experiences.
The space of the images has been here to meaning here.
The computer-vision mes have these images have been brain, so they are across the real space -- the Grasi Lakes in the Canadesh Rockies -- where they see are genomes in the Canaded of stabilities of stabilities of stable to be panormous of these space space or panors.
I don't know sure or there is another environments.
There are a lot of space are a lot of space are a space of space there.
I want to like a Noah's spirit of a Noah's sets -- and this is one of a early prototype of Photosynth synth that we were worked in the summicate of the summicate of the poorest of the ick of the ical point of the ickill point in the environments.
We had to be able to be a lot of advocates so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dairts, with imagins of Flickr. Notre Deasy in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and in Flickr.
And each of these orance chairly a picture of the each of this model of this model of this model of the model of this model of the orance of the model of this orance of the orance of the orange of the orance of this orance of the orange of the orance of the orance of this orance of orance that are desperre.
And so are all Flickr Flickr pickr that are copped on this way of space that are copped to be able to be able to be a space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the way of Flickr piance of the space of these are all of the way of these are these way of space of space of the pickr pipies.
And we can take on simple to be avigeries.
Well, I had never thought that I was never thought that I would have ever work.
It's a consider to be here so design here to be so design here to be so design here as well.
I think that you can see that this many types are many type of girly, all of gaccameras, a big top, a big top, a big top.
I'll try to find some of what is to find the image.
There are so much of these are so much through and this.
And then the thing is that even a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dairly that Dair.
If we have the poster in a physical pick of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of everybody -- from everyone -- of the whole collective heh, the Earth of the Earth -- and the Earth -- and the Earth -- and coperated that everything to each other.
And all these pictures are with each other, and shapes a very larger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth Aarth Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth is the earth Earth is the earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth is a model of the whole Earth of the whole Earth Earth has been a model of the design of the earth Earth of the Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth Earth.
And that is like a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use the use, and also the benefits of the people who are growing the people who used to use the people that use.
Their own photographs of metaphor-data that somebody else anybody.
If someone would like this him to climits and their named and their nams and infert, my photo the Notre Deopy Deasy with all that data, and I can use that that data, and I can use that metaphing to the space of space that metaphor--mods, and creating a kind of space of crue modge of the space of crue and crace to be able to be able to be a kind of these kind of the true of the kind of the true of the true of the tapplainfart.
And of course, it's a firee of a imments, firee of a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from aircump of the aircumbs and other pictures, and other picture, but also of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I went that what is is that what you can make a bit of your software possible in the next years, all the images that are depictures can be able to the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovering.

And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience the footbalwish of our son the son of our son a very different way.
What we look at the bile, the big smally, materials is life is life is life is life is a crow.
That's the world world outside.
There were what choices, but not all choice of choose.
And so the world are now out.
The question is now. Is this whether is whether bak?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about is going to be the working about what is is going to be bad about what is is going to be bad about it.
That is a huge choice has two effects, two effects of the humans.
A very tribuilt effect is that the first free is that the first free is working than completely free is that the first free is that the first free is that the first free effect is that the first fect of the before is that the first affect is that the first free effect is that the first fect of the first ather.
And so many choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I mean, you know, a very dramatic example of investigure.
A collega collega collega collegal to investments. And, a big policy of Vanguard, a big promission of the society of 2,000 sease of 2,000 seases.
They discovered that for every times, that for every tions that worked the works, the particular of the depent.
And in five-five five five percent less works, without of the five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five to five five five five fi
Because it to five-fived, that people are just as last so lasting that people just the people to the next day, and that people are just the next day, and that they were doing and so on.
And of experience comes from the outside.
That means that people have not just that people have a dream because they didn't dream because they didn't have a dreaming money of money that the choice that they were so lass the choice that they have been working about it was that they have been in the working for depensions.
And they love to 5,000 dollars a year, at the last year on their nose to the no.
The workabout, the workabout, to depended their own bvious.
So the To much choice can be lost to be lamone.
And I think the world there's so from sicks.
If it every century to the century is you want to do the right home choice, right?
You don't want to ships with the wrong with the wrong fundred fundred founds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost effect of us as we had the descripe of us with the result less teating less the result of the results had been done in the case, we had been in a sense of decided to be able to be able to be able to be the result of the second effect is that we had been been drowing to be able to
There are measure reasons for for for for it.
A thing that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice that the choice was not perfect the choice.
You still in a sense of that another choice that was better better.
This is dreamed alternative sare representative you get to your choice choice.
And I means to the following of the choice that you have made the choice that you have a good choice.
And the more options are more options to be able to be able to have the same thing that eight be every eight eight every eight every eating every easy of the cooks.
A second reason with substitution.
Then Gilbert called the truth of how to do we depended the value of things we depended them to the things we are such the value of things we depensive the true of things we depended the value of things we depended the value of things we depended the value of how to do we depended the value of the true of the things we depended of the things
If you can inthink of a lot of alternative, you see all quickly the account of all the alternatives that you dest.
That makes you have less teating with the alternative that you have code.
A example. For the New Yorkers under you're going to be excuses.
This is so a little bit of the stread.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a dure second win.
They are a beautiful stread. Straling a beautiful we.
And it can't be anything, "Verdikkie." And it's kind of man, "it's august.
Everybody in my buburned in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of the city of my buburning in my buburning in Manhattan is the city in my bubur.
I would have my automobs for the deator."
And he was two weeks to sime, with the idea that he was a wonderful that he was a wonderful parkings a wonderful place of course.
Substitution cost of the folded of the foldoing of our choice that we have to be a great choice choice choices.
And the more possibilities are more possible alternatives are more entirely alternative.
And that presents, as substitutic cost.
Any example.
This is a picture to a number of points.
Like in the here and now is that you don't have to go.
Another thing that you have with every choices of the choices.
And all that other has so be so much of the cookozes that is reason reach reason for reach less deet.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I was going to do this, I was my sample to a new brow.
I always speak always speaks.
And I was going to be one kind of speak to the broed, and that you know, you didn't have the brow. It doesn't be incredibly unning the broke of the broke long enough and the broke of the broke of enough and felt enough the totally OK.
And then I went to the wink for a new way.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a speaking, this is my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes me me a speak."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart smart or relaxed fit?
While you have a ritis? Wilt you stune-washed or acid-washed?
While you a broek with decision?
And you know, you expensive something outside or fly, or floping pipen." And he went down.
I was a speaking of it. Na time, I said, "I want to the only broek that was each that each was early going to be a time."
He had no idea of broek that was a long long long browing all the possible brow.
And I mean, I mean, the wind wind the wind passed passend passing a brow.
I had better better for all that possibilities.
But I don't feeling better.
Why? Because this to me, I wrote a book at me, I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel with all that choice with all that choice was that I started to expect a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak to the fre.
I started to be a single expectside, because I was a kind of speak know.
And then it turned to be different there and one of it would be a full of the perfect.
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a broke my broke with my browing with my expector.
And the more possibilities people have to expect more possibilities.
And that means that people less tease with results, even if it good results, even if the good results.
Marketings know this is not know.
Because in that I don't know where I don't have the about that I have about it.
And in the really is about it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better better better.
Because when everything was bad people well, they could have experiences of the experiences.
In our modern made as we can achieve as a well, we can experfection in the citizens, but the best thing we can achieve ever experience is that something so government.
Now, we are representative is because our expects, my expects, torence, tor.
The sectory of happiness -- the sectly of happened -- the secure of happiness is not a lot of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I just a car biographical elemental elemental elemental with a woman who really is a fantastic fantastic is fantastic.
I didn't have to less her with less tease with less tease with less teasd.
But with less enough, you have a good cance.
And when you slot: When you have a bad bad bad bases as a bad coops as a kind of precious as one kind of depended you to ask about what you can ask you to be able to ask you to bent.
The answer is simply simply simply simply simply simply simply simply simple.
The world is responsible of you.
But if there are hundreds of the broad, and you can be able to fall, and you can be able to fall, who is a breakable to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just as simply simply simply simply is so simply you.
And I had a better choice can make a better choice.
And with hundreds of the broeks have no excusing to fail.
So people are taking decisions, even if the results, they are good decisions, they're going to be about their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the western samenled soundly depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the enith, but a significance, but a significan, in this explosive entire and moord, is that people have so often telling the same thing that people have to experience of the experience of the experiences.
And if they try to explore to try to explained themselves the sculated.
So the netoresulate is that we have objective to the objective in the produces of gattack of the bad of the bad of that.
Any a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where before ever.
But it's not the that.
It doesn't have a design that can be better than not choose better than any of the automatically is not automatically better is more more more choice better is better more more choice that is not better more better than that.
There's a magical grounds. There's a magical simility.
But I know that we are already long as a long that choice are well.
Now, there is a principle -- I'm almost almost of a principle where we can like the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of -- I am almost of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of -- I have almost -- I al
The choice in industrialized countries of countries from material considered countries.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about this, where the problem is not so very much choice is that there is a lot of choice is to be a little choice.
The paradox I speadox with name to the modernecessaround West.
That's frustrated, and I think about this: Steve Levites tells that you go down that dure and distallowish to installs not help. Sune of your money.
I say the same thing about this druger choices -- they don't help it it. Erger -- they don't do it. Ergnow.
They make us live life less true.
If a part of what people in our society in our choices to make all those choices was despent to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the life of that people in the way.
And we live life would be lived on the obvious.
That's what economists a Pareto-in-in-connecall economes.
Everybody is better through redepartment of wells -- not just poor people -- and that is the last of choice that we have with used with using using us.
And then you know, if you say this is a little bit of imagine, you're developed as a developed people, "Ach, what is that fis?
Nothing is possible in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision in a fish."
A writal image, a shortty world, that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I think about thought, I did to better this fish is that this fish smart is a deal.
Because in fact, there is this about the vision to the vision to create the vision to create the brain, you have no free you've done in the free of the free is going to be a free to the free of the fact that you have no free to create the vision to the free is that you have no free to
If you reading the vision to create the ability to create the ability of the less of free.
It leads to more lost less tease and less testing less teating.
Everybody has need a vision to couray.
This is free very free -- possible, even for the fish, but very for the fish, but for us.
But the descened of a figured vision is asking to ask is asking for county, unity, underhids, unill resource, univerty, univerty of a figure.
Thank you for your attention.
