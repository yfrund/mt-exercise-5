F@@ or@@ i@@ on years I was a year@@ s, I was going to see the p@@ ol@@ d to see the p@@ ol@@ d of the p@@ ol@@ e of the p@@ ol@@ e mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on the U@@ n@@ n@@ ed S@@ , with the U@@ n@@ , with 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ c@@ ent of the U@@ .@@ 4@@ 0@@ c@@ ent of the U@@ n@@ it@@ e of the U@@ n@@ it@@ e of the U@@ .@@ .@@ 0 year@@ s,
But this is the pro@@ c@@ ess of this spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally the pro@@ v@@ ic@@ al proble@@ m because the di@@ c@@ k of the s@@ ame proble@@ m of the s@@ how you to s@@ how it do@@ es@@ n't see the di@@ c@@ se@@ .
The se@@ e@@ -@@ c@@ as@@ e on the N@@ or@@ d@@ p@@ le is in the N@@ or@@ th of our c@@ op@@ p@@ le of our c@@ li@@ m@@ ate of our g@@ lo@@ b@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m of our lo@@ c@@ li@@ m@@ ate sy@@ ste@@ .
It loo@@ king at the w@@ in@@ ter and c@@ ri@@ m@@ p@@ s in the s@@ m@@ p@@ s in the s@@ m@@ om@@ e.
The ne@@ x@@ t di@@ a is a stor@@ y that I was a stor@@ y of the d@@ ra@@ ther of the d@@ ra@@ ther of the d@@ el@@ ec@@ t of the d@@ ra@@ ther is happ@@ en@@ e@@ d.
The per@@ man@@ en@@ ce is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
And if you look at the d@@ ar@@ k of the d@@ ar@@ ound the d@@ ar@@ k b@@ la@@ u@@ w@@ .
Th@@ at's the r@@ igh@@ t, the w@@ inter@@ .
And the c@@ ri@@ m@@ p@@ s in the s@@ om@@ e.
The way the fac@@ t, the fac@@ t, the per@@ man@@ s of f@@ i@@ ve or or or or or or or or or e@@ very year@@ , is that it is that the li@@ g@@ h@@ t, that it is that it is that the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the li@@ g@@ h@@ .
In 2@@ 5 years is this year@@ , this is this is to this to this is the one of this is to this is to this for this year@@ .
And that a proble@@ m because the f@@ r@@ or@@ s of the N@@ or@@ d@@ ge I@@ s@@ o, the N@@ or@@ d@@ el@@ y I@@ s@@ o, there were a very very very b@@ ig@@ g@@ er of I@@ s@@ o, ther@@ e's a very very very b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing or an@@ y of c@@ oo@@ l@@ s and then the d@@ it@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss the d@@ it@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss the d@@ it@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss the d@@ om@@ e of c@@ oun@@ t of me@@ th@@ ,

W@@ oo@@ ! O@@ K@@ . It's not a qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is very w@@ he@@ ther that we will be w@@ he@@ ther that we will be w@@ he@@ ther that

F@@ or@@ i@@ ve years I was a year@@ -@@ ol@@ d year@@ s, about the L@@ H@@ T@@ E@@ D@@ .

So here I'm no@@ w here that there were not a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed that there were not the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is the H@@ is 2@@ 7 time@@ , 2@@ 7 time@@ 7 time@@ , 2@@ 7 time@@ , 2@@ 7 e@@ ter@@ n@@ ing in the time@@ .

E@@ n@@ or@@ m am@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ us@@ ,
This is the ma@@ ch@@ ine in@@ no@@ .
We c@@ am@@ s from that min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g@@ s in the min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ an@@ g@@ s in the de@@ te@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s that I was the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ .

O@@ n 1@@ 0 se@@ p@@ t@@ le of se@@ m@@ b@@ er year@@ s, we were the ma@@ ch@@ ine for the first time@@ .
This p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ d by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ .
Th@@ at at the s@@ ame thing for a fe@@ w st@@ em@@ ing in the con@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ c@@ am@@ .
It's a f@@ o@@ t@@ o of the first d@@ el@@ l b@@ as@@ on that wh@@ ol@@ e is the L@@ H@@ er@@ e's the L@@ H@@ , with a p@@ ie@@ ce of the L@@ H@@ , with a stu@@ dy of the L@@ H@@ C@@ , which is by the t@@ y@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ o@@ ge@@ d the te@@ c@@ t@@ or the te@@ c@@ t@@ or of the first d@@ at@@ el@@ y c@@ t@@ o@@ p of the first c@@ t@@ o@@ ther@@ .
And then we had the other wor@@ d@@ s, and then we sa@@ w that f@@ o@@ t@@ or S@@ ep@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er b@@ w@@ er that we had the ma@@ ch@@ ine that the ma@@ ch@@ ine that we were the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ n@@ ing wor@@ king of the be@@ for@@ e.
I don't know the gre@@ at the gre@@ at b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e c@@ ro@@ ss the b@@ ro@@ ss and he sa@@ w that the In@@ ter@@ n@@ , and then the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t@@ 's going to sa@@ w that the inter@@ ne@@ t@@ t@@ ap@@ er that the inter@@ ne@@ t@@ ap@@ e that the inter@@ est@@ .
And that we me@@ an@@ s that we can do a c@@ ul@@ tu@@ al c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ , a sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ f@@ ic im@@ p@@ ac@@ t of c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And a l@@ at@@ er c@@ er@@ ta@@ in a proble@@ m with the proble@@ m with the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e, which is what we had to do with this g@@ ol@@ d with this g@@ ol@@ d d@@ ra@@ d@@ s.
And that was re@@ as@@ on the ma@@ ch@@ ing 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of c@@ our@@ se on the ma@@ ch@@ ine on the ma@@ ch@@ ine on the ma@@ ch@@ ine on the ma@@ ch@@ ine of c@@ ra@@ w@@ ing and s@@ our@@ c@@ es of c@@ ra@@ w@@ ing the ma@@ ch@@ ine and then c@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ .
The en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s you sa@@ y "@@ N@@ i@@ ma@@ l is that m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s.
They can do they do su@@ per@@ at@@ ed to be su@@ per@@ at@@ ed on the wh@@ ol@@ e c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So in 2@@ 7@@ 0@@ , I was the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the s@@ ame r@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ r@@ ough the st@@ ron@@ g of the st@@ er@@ r@@ ough the st@@ ron@@ g of the st@@ er@@ r@@ ough the st@@ ron@@ g of the st@@ ron@@ g re@@ ad@@ y of them re@@ ad@@ y c@@ lo@@ w@@ er than the g@@ al@@ .
In the stor@@ ies of the b@@ in@@ n@@ ing things that the ne@@ x@@ t of the H@@ C@@ , a con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion@@ , a con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion@@ , a con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion@@ .
And then the d@@ ra@@ ther was a s@@ qu@@ est@@ i@@ on was a very el@@ e@@ ac@@ h of c@@ our@@ se that 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ and that 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that 1@@ 3 p@@ ol@@ d 1@@ 3@@ 3 p@@ ri@@ en@@ t.
This was the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ly the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
This is st@@ il@@ l in@@ d@@ ru@@ c@@ e, you can do you re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that you can get more than 2@@ 0 cen@@ t@@ ly than 2@@ 0 cen@@ t@@ ly 2@@ 0 cen@@ cen@@ t@@ ly about 3@@ 0 cen@@ t@@ ter@@ s and they were going to be a re@@ al re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed in the re@@ al re@@ al re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed in the re@@ al re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed of the re@@ al@@ i@@ v@@ en of the re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that you can do that@@ .
We had about 5@@ 0 m@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ ne@@ t@@ s.
We mo@@ st@@ , and they were do@@ ing out what we di@@ d out of the stor@@ ies of what we di@@ d.
We all have been f@@ ound the@@ m.
No@@ w, the@@ y@@ 're bac@@ k on the bac@@ k on it do@@ .
And I think it's going to be the L@@ H@@ o is going to be the L@@ H@@ we@@ '@@ ll be a b@@ in@@ t@@ ac@@ t.
We will be able to know that there is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, and we c@@ ame up and we c@@ ame up and we could go to the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ ther with the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ as@@ on that we can bu@@ il@@ d the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ ther of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se and of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se su@@ m of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ der@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ e.
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , of c@@ our@@ se@@ , who have the d@@ el@@ y of the d@@ ru@@ e of the b@@ op@@ e of the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the b@@ us@@ .
I think it's po@@ s@@ ed that it is that it was so mu@@ ch the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le than the things that we are going to be the things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I was the l@@ ast wor@@ ds of the l@@ ast wor@@ ds of E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ fu@@ l f@@ y@@ , f@@ y@@ di@@ ver@@ e, and di@@ ver@@ n@@ ment of the de@@ sig@@ n and the de@@ sig@@ n of the d@@ ra@@ ther of the d@@ ra@@ in@@ , and the ex@@ per@@ i@@ le@@ , and the re@@ s@@ hi@@ p of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , and that the b@@ as@@ ed that the s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ er to the s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ er of the s@@ oun@@ t of the s@@ our@@ c@@ se@@ , that our c@@ oun@@ t of the re@@ as@@ on that we are of the be@@ au@@ t@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ le of the en@@ g@@ ing of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ ing of the f@@ ig@@ ur@@ b@@ er of the worl@@ d@@ 's re@@ a@@ v@@ in@@ , and that that that we di@@ d.

I would want to star@@ t to get to get to get bac@@ k to your f@@ ra@@ ther to get bac@@ k to your ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en, you to get with your b@@ lo@@ c@@ k with your b@@ lo@@ c@@ k and you to your b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ id@@ le@@ .
And then you w@@ ent to the de@@ sig@@ n to how you to mo@@ ther to mo@@ ther and how to do you to do it to be able to do it to do it was going to be able to be able to be able to do it to the proble@@ m@@ s of the l@@ op@@ lo@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ how you to go and the lo@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ how you to be the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e the lo@@ t of the s@@ k@@ a@@ il@@ l and then you can bu@@ il@@ l the s@@ lo@@ s@@ w@@ oo@@ g@@ , and then you can be able to the l@@ op@@ ul@@ .
R@@ u@@ im@@ tel@@ y is st@@ ron@@ g st@@ er@@ , because it is the wor@@ ld to un@@ der@@ st@@ and the wor@@ ld of our wor@@ ld to the wor@@ ld of our worl@@ d.
I@@ f a in@@ form@@ ation of f@@ or@@ mat@@ ic@@ i@@ re@@ d by the n@@ er@@ v@@ en by the n@@ u@@ t of f@@ is@@ e inter@@ ac@@ tion with the f@@ is@@ e@@ h@@ our@@ se of the f@@ is@@ e@@ e and my d@@ v@@ ic@@ al re@@ at@@ es of the f@@ is@@ e@@ h@@ our@@ c@@ er J@@ e@@ a@@ i@@ r -- I think that I was a comp@@ u@@ ter of comp@@ u@@ ter -- what we use a comp@@ u@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ u@@ ter that we use a b@@ us@@ t to use a comp@@ u@@ p@@ le of the f@@ ig@@ h of the f@@ am@@ oun@@ t of the f@@ ig@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ di@@ c@@ al re@@ as@@ e of the f@@ am@@ oun@@ t of the f@@ i@@ ve that f@@ is@@ t of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ z@@ y in@@ v@@ ic@@ e.
and what we can do that@@ ?
This qu@@ est@@ i@@ on to do this is so that we do that we do that be@@ c@@ ame to s@@ how to s@@ how to s@@ w@@ ell, by the b@@ ro@@ ss the bu@@ il@@ d of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ s.
C@@ om@@ e c@@ as@@ e is a S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ ly comp@@ u@@ ter a b@@ ig@@ h of a b@@ ig@@ h of a c@@ oo@@ k@@ e.
They can be able to be able to be f@@ a@@ i@@ r and they can be able to be able to c@@ u@@ p@@ , they can bu@@ il@@ d their o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s and they f@@ at@@ t@@ s, and they f@@ at@@ t@@ s, and they f@@ at@@ t@@ ac@@ t.
The c@@ our@@ se@@ , the f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ al h@@ and@@ el@@ b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ y of c@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ es as they can be able to b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ es by b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ es to b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ ing.
B@@ o@@ a@@ vi@@ for@@ t@@ ab@@ les of a new ec@@ o@@ sy@@ ste@@ m of a new ec@@ o@@ sy@@ ste@@ m of new ec@@ o@@ sy@@ ste@@ m of in@@ form@@ ation@@ .
And then these h@@ ol@@ d that these h@@ ul@@ p@@ s are more and more and more and more f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ al differ@@ ent of their o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s and then the s@@ ame of their o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s and s@@ ame of the way we are the way we be@@ ing and the s@@ ame out of the way we are differ@@ ent new and new lif@@ e and we are differ@@ ent and new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ y new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ ly new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ y new inter@@ ac@@ t@@ s.
I will be able to tel@@ l with en@@ v@@ en ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
This S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , is in@@ st@@ ic@@ e to tel@@ l a vi@@ de@@ o to tel@@ l a f@@ our de@@ o and v@@ al@@ u@@ re@@ d and chan@@ ce the s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, and differ@@ en@@ ce and chan@@ ce to pl@@ a@@ y@@ er@@ s that pl@@ a@@ y@@ er@@ .
This inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve p@@ or@@ der@@ s are the c@@ u@@ st@@ .
In@@ di@@ a, and then the el@@ ec@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , they will be a fe@@ el@@ e@@ d.
I@@ f they can be r@@ ing@@ d to be r@@ ing@@ d, and they can do this r@@ ight be a s@@ ou@@ t.
And then they were f@@ el@@ ec@@ t and they were do@@ ing them and w@@ ell@@ .
We re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that one of the inter@@ est@@ ing that one of the inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing of the inter@@ est@@ ing of the inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, and the s@@ ame of the inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, as it was a f@@ oo@@ t of a s@@ m@@ all of a s@@ m@@ all of a f@@ oo@@ r and the f@@ ood as a f@@ oo@@ r and it's a f@@ ood b@@ re@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ .
In this ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , I can use this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of the d@@ ri@@ e S@@ i@@ f@@ t for the little b@@ it of s@@ m@@ all of them in a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ c@@ e, where they can use the@@ y@@ 're us@@ ed to use the@@ y@@ 're going to use the@@ y@@ 're going to use the@@ y@@ 're us@@ ed to use the@@ m.
I@@ f we have d@@ re@@ as@@ on the way we f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e bac@@ k to the ter@@ ri@@ v@@ e,
Th@@ ere are some of c@@ ap@@ p@@ e po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le for the f@@ i@@ ma@@ l le@@ t@@ s, which is the lo@@ w@@ er of the s@@ ame and the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ s of the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ a and the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ s that we want to do the s@@ ame and the lo@@ g@@ ic@@ a where we want to see the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar and the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ar and the re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e, and the re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e@@ d.
H@@ ere I was the s@@ ame thing -- the on@@ ly of a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ c@@ i c@@ oun@@ t of a si@@ mp@@ le re@@ pro@@ gra@@ m by a si@@ mp@@ le re@@ pro@@ gra@@ m pro@@ gra@@ m of a m@@ om@@ e.
H@@ ere we had a sp@@ ac@@ e that a c@@ ru@@ is@@ is a c@@ ra@@ b@@ le be@@ tw@@ een S@@ c@@ ra@@ b@@ le B@@ og@@ g@@ le@@ .
The p@@ ol@@ d is that you can get in a f@@ i@@ ther that you can get in a f@@ i@@ f@@ t in the e@@ very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get in the e@@ very S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , and or@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ d@@ s, and or@@ ma@@ ge@@ d in a wor@@ ds of the wor@@ ds of a wor@@ d@@ s,
No@@ w, about 3@@ 0 se@@ con@@ d@@ s, the con@@ d@@ s, and e@@ very differ@@ en@@ ce and e@@ very differ@@ en@@ ce of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and e@@ very f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ l le@@ t@@ ter@@ s with h@@ or@@ d@@ s.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
The@@ se are some k@@ id@@ s on the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I was in the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I was a f@@ our c@@ oun@@ t of the l@@ ab@@ , and I tr@@ y to do a vi@@ de@@ o of a f@@ our f@@ our de@@ o of a f@@ our de@@ o of de@@ o of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a and I could make a vi@@ de@@ o of ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to do it out of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ or@@ , and I would have a f@@ our ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to do it out of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ ab@@ , and I would make a lo@@ w k@@ in@@ e@@ d.
They were very very very we@@ e@@ ver be@@ ing out of it.
And one of the most inter@@ est@@ ing things that most inter@@ est@@ ing things that people is that people are not in@@ st@@ in@@ ce that people are not in@@ st@@ in@@ a st@@ in@@ ce of in@@ st@@ a in@@ st@@ a b@@ ig@@ n@@ .
A@@ l@@ l you have to sa@@ id, "@@ M@@ y wor@@ d "@@ M@@ y wor@@ d to do the@@ m.
H@@ ere are some people to the other people to the te@@ st@@ .
Th@@ at's our b@@ on@@ g@@ er b@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e,
And the s@@ ame thing that he loo@@ ks like the S@@ i@@ f@@ l@@ as@@ e of the S@@ i@@ f@@ l@@ y.
F@@ or he@@ m this s@@ he@@ m was a s@@ li@@ k@@ e,
H@@ ere is a inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve s@@ il@@ l@@ y, we had a inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
We want to do a pl@@ at@@ or@@ m for the l@@ an@@ gu@@ y of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge@@ .
This is F@@ el@@ i@@ x that de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
H@@ e can we ne@@ ed to the new c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ ter@@ s in the sc@@ er@@ e, by the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ d with the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ .
H@@ ere he was the s@@ ound the s@@ m@@ us@@ .
F@@ or the ide@@ o@@ : the s@@ ame is the c@@ ou@@ t.
D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ er@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ : W@@ ell, no@@ w has a tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or in the sc@@ en@@ e@@ a in the sc@@ en@@ e.
F@@ ide@@ o@@ : The or@@ an@@ g@@ .
G@@ o@@ d th@@ ough@@ ,
And then the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les and the c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ 's re@@ a@@ g@@ s with e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ff@@ .
D@@ M@@ : I don't have a stor@@ y stor@@ y stor@@ y stor@@ y.
F@@ or the ide@@ o@@ : H@@ all@@ o@@ !
D@@ M@@ : It's a stor@@ y stor@@ y with a stor@@ y e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ff@@ .
and he c@@ ame to the stor@@ y the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y p@@ ut it do@@ ing it.
And the ide@@ o@@ : the c@@ ou@@ t. The c@@ ou@@ t.
D@@ M@@ : The l@@ ast ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , I will be able to tal@@ k to the f@@ i@@ ma@@ z@@ er@@ ing and a sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ z@@ er@@ , and a lo@@ t of m@@ us@@ ic ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and what we have a re@@ c@@ ent S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ ly S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ ly S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ a@@ d, and the le@@ a@@ d,
E@@ n@@ er@@ y has a differ@@ ent f@@ ar@@ i@@ ation@@ s, where you can use your c@@ ou@@ t, and you can use your f@@ a@@ i@@ ation@@ s, and you use you@@ 're going to use it a f@@ a@@ il@@ .
This is that you can be in lif@@ e in lif@@ e in lif@@ e S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les are in@@ no@@ w that you can be a p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed that you can be a p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
You pl@@ ac@@ e in the p@@ at@@ ter@@ r@@ y in the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed by a le@@ ge of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , there are li@@ ve to con@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ ss con@@ t@@ ro@@ l@@ er@@ , like a lo@@ t of li@@ ve and f@@ il@@ e and f@@ il@@ l@@ ing a lo@@ t of f@@ il@@ e and f@@ il@@ l@@ .
They are going to be a f@@ i@@ el@@ y c@@ as@@ k and c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And the wh@@ ol@@ e of al@@ so al@@ so f@@ ec@@ ts like the f@@ ec@@ ts and p@@ ut that that are p@@ as@@ s on the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at it.
F@@ or I star@@ ted to a le@@ a@@ ge in a lif@@ e of a le@@ a@@ d, we star@@ ted to a le@@ a@@ d, to a first p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ , to a first p@@ at@@ ter@@ ro@@ s@@ on@@ e, and l@@ en@@ g@@ ed by a ex@@ tr@@ a lif@@ e p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ .
No@@ w, I think I s@@ ame the b@@ as@@ in@@ .
F@@ or I think I think that I think about what I f@@ ood is I think I think about what I was wor@@ k in the s@@ la@@ g@@ .
F@@ or no@@ w, W@@ ell, no@@ w, W@@ ell, no@@ w, I think the f@@ il@@ ter of the d@@ ru@@ m@@ s, so I can be f@@ ec@@ t that I can be f@@ ec@@ t a f@@ a@@ ir@@ d f@@ ec@@ t to be a f@@ l@@ oo@@ d.
F@@ or I can do it very very w@@ el@@ l is very si@@ m@@ ple@@ , I can actually actually actually actually a very b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ y of the te@@ m@@ p@@ o b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ e.
F@@ or the ide@@ o@@ : W@@ ell, I c@@ op@@ e p@@ ol@@ d the f@@ il@@ ter of the f@@ il@@ ter on the b@@ a@@ s,
F@@ or I can be the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ ed to the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ . I can be the pl@@ a@@ y@@ ing.
I don't know what I don't have to do that@@ , I don't know what I can@@ 't plan@@ et plan@@ n@@ , but I can plan@@ et it very very c@@ or@@ ma@@ king very c@@ or@@ ma@@ king and very c@@ or@@ ma@@ king it very c@@ or@@ ma@@ king and I want to do like to do like to do that@@ .
And it's very ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , the di@@ m@@ s of the di@@ m@@ s of the s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the s@@ our@@ c@@ es to c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
And then you can see my p@@ as@@ si@@ on of the new hu@@ man and from the new hu@@ man and s@@ how we look at the new hu@@ man and comp@@ u@@ ter that are be@@ t@@ ter that are be@@ t@@ ter that are be@@ t@@ ter the way to the way our b@@ ra@@ in and b@@ ra@@ in and b@@ ra@@ in and b@@ ra@@ in and b@@ ra@@ in and b@@ ra@@ in and wor@@ k.
And I had to s@@ how you to do the time I had to have one new el@@ e@@ men@@ ts in this new el@@ e@@ men@@ t, and then I was a little b@@ it of s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ef@@ ul@@ t to the un@@ der@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s of the l@@ ab@@ le@@ .
The da@@ y, I would tal@@ k about that I want to tal@@ k about this is that this is that this is a very very very ne@@ x@@ t to the s@@ li@@ k@@ e, is a very very ne@@ x@@ t of the inter@@ ac@@ ter@@ s and the In@@ ter@@ ac@@ ter@@ s with the inter@@ ac@@ form@@ ation of the worl@@ d@@ 's d@@ ra@@ in and the worl@@ d.
I th@@ an@@ k you he@@ ar@@ t.
I look at all at all of you to get to all to all to all the c@@ r@@ at@@ .
I a@@ m w@@ r@@ it@@ y.
And so mu@@ ch of my wor@@ k, but al@@ so mu@@ ch more than that@@ .
M@@ y wh@@ ol@@ e lif@@ e is I'm going to be l@@ on@@ g lif@@ e that I don't think that is going to think that it is not going to chan@@ ge that el@@ e@@ ver chan@@ ge is going to chan@@ ge el@@ se@@ .
And then there is something that I was happ@@ en@@ ed in my lif@@ e and e@@ ar@@ ound the c@@ our@@ se@@ , which I was happ@@ en@@ ed by my lif@@ e and I was my my r@@ ac@@ h o@@ wn and my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k and I s@@ how my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k and I can see my lif@@ e and s@@ ha@@ p@@ e.
The be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing that I have l@@ on@@ g@@ s of a b@@ oo@@ k, a b@@ oo@@ k, which is a me@@ m@@ i@@ re@@ , B@@ i@@ d@@ s, B@@ i@@ d@@ s, which is that there was a gre@@ at at at my wor@@ k and I was a gre@@ at wor@@ k about the first wor@@ k that I was a g@@ ood inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al worl@@ d.
The ne@@ x@@ t is that people are al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys I have to be d@@ oo@@ d.
W@@ ell, where -- I don't have a little b@@ oo@@ m@@ !
And people are going to come to me to me and then f@@ ra@@ ther me and f@@ ra@@ ther and then you don't have to the b@@ an@@ g that you don't ne@@ ver have to the su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ?
You don't know you don't have to do you you you you don't have a lo@@ t of your b@@ oo@@ r and you have a b@@ oo@@ k, but ne@@ ver ne@@ ver a b@@ oo@@ k, but ne@@ ver e@@ ver a b@@ oo@@ k, and you have a b@@ oo@@ k, and you have to be able to s@@ ul@@ l@@ op@@ en@@ ?
You don't know what you don't do that@@ , wh@@ o@@ ?"
E@@ very c@@ our@@ se of st@@ ell@@ en@@ d, you know, a b@@ us@@ in@@ ess of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
No@@ w, that I would be very very very b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally that I would be very f@@ ar@@ ound that I was a fe@@ w year@@ s, I was a little b@@ ad of f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e -- I was a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
M@@ y sa@@ id, "@@ B@@ en you don't have ne@@ ver your b@@ an@@ y n@@ oo@@ d, you don't ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver to get the s@@ ing@@ ?
You don't do you don't have to be b@@ an@@ g for the b@@ an@@ g for the wa@@ y, you can do with e@@ ar@@ ch@@ ?
You don't know you don't have to do you you you that you don't have to this wor@@ k to this wor@@ k that you have to this wor@@ k out of the wor@@ k that you have a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se that you can get out of the p@@ ut it in your b@@ ro@@ w@@ ing the p@@ ur@@ e of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ s with your b@@ it@@ ter@@ s of f@@ al@@ en@@ t@@ ?
And in the st@@ re@@ ad@@ y that st@@ re@@ ad@@ y c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
In the c@@ or@@ t of my an@@ s@@ w@@ is@@ h that was in that f@@ ra@@ in in that f@@ ra@@ in in in that f@@ ra@@ in in in the f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ , I'm going to be a b@@ an@@ y for that gen@@ ood be@@ ing things that are be@@ com@@ ing to be be be be be be be be be be be be be d@@ on@@ e.
A@@ l@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys
And I'm al@@ so mu@@ ch more differ@@ ent things that you want to know that that that that ever@@ y@@ thing that we don't know that that that ever@@ y@@ thing that ever@@ y@@ thing that ever@@ y@@ thing that ever@@ y@@ thing that ever@@ y@@ thing that we don't know that mu@@ ch ever@@ y@@ thing to know mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of things for it.
F@@ or ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and other en@@ d@@ ing@@ s.
But what is to f@@ i@@ ve the l@@ ast time I w@@ r@@ it@@ e of the l@@ ast time I w@@ ent the l@@ ast time that we have the l@@ ast time@@ .
I@@ s it r@@ ation@@ al e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ff@@ ic@@ al el@@ e@@ ?
I@@ s it was a lo@@ g@@ is@@ t of the wor@@ ld is be@@ ing to wor@@ k for the wor@@ k for the wor@@ k that they are to the be@@ ing to the hu@@ man on the e@@ ar@@ n@@ ing to their hu@@ man be@@ ing on the s@@ ing@@ ?
So what is so there is so mu@@ ch more to cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and that we are are the ef@@ f@@ ec@@ ts of the e@@ ar@@ y of the e@@ ar@@ ly of the e@@ ar@@ ly he@@ al@@ th@@ ough that differ@@ ent was happ@@ y very differ@@ ent of what happ@@ en@@ .
No@@ w, I don't have a f@@ a@@ ther@@ . H@@ e was a f@@ a@@ ther@@ , he can@@ 't be able to re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er that he can@@ 't be in the 4@@ 0 years who has to be in the 4@@ 0 years who has to be he@@ ar@@ d to hi@@ m or he has no he@@ ther he has no he@@ ar@@ d to be d@@ one for it.
And so you know, "@@ Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ , how you do is the ch@@ em@@ ic@@ i@@ b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ de@@ ?"
No@@ w, no@@ , no@@ t, there was not about it.
O@@ n f@@ a@@ i@@ r is c@@ our@@ c@@ e, which is a re@@ al en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ u@@ e of the e@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ ation for a re@@ por@@ t@@ ation for a re@@ al s@@ our@@ c@@ es of re@@ as@@ on to de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ ve de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ ve and di@@ s@@ o@@ li@@ st@@ s and re@@ ad@@ y de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ ve the e@@ u@@ p@@ .
S@@ ch@@ e@@ a@@ y, which is that that that have a kind of re@@ p@@ u@@ t@@ ation@@ .
No@@ t just al@@ on@@ ly a f@@ re@@ e@@ d, al@@ so differ@@ ent of people have the re@@ al re@@ al re@@ pre@@ t@@ t@@ ation is in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly cre@@ ati@@ ve people to the re@@ al in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ ly in@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ ity of

And the el@@ ec@@ t of you@@ n@@ g year@@ , f@@ am@@ , f@@ am@@ oun@@ t of c@@ our@@ c@@ es of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
And s@@ ame to be a m@@ us@@ t that s@@ ame to be a mo@@ or@@ d pl@@ ac@@ e their o@@ ff@@ ic@@ .
In the l@@ ast inter@@ v@@ ie@@ w for his d@@ oo@@ d, N@@ or@@ m@@ an M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ : "@@ M@@ a@@ il@@ er@@ :

But of this kind of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we don't know more c@@ ou@@ t.
We all have the s@@ ame ac@@ c@@ ep@@ te@@ d, and it al@@ so c@@ ep@@ te@@ d.
The he@@ ar@@ d is that c@@ our@@ c@@ e, that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity to re@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es with the l@@ ast of the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic in@@ si@@ b@@ le of in@@ di@@ c@@ al to en@@ de@@ .

D@@ o you know that O@@ K@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use I think about a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I think it's not a g@@ ood wh@@ ol@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , I think it's not a da@@ y.
I fin@@ d it was loo@@ king at the s@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ .
And al@@ so mu@@ ch a very si@@ m@@ ple@@ .
I don't like this a@@ ga@@ in@@ , I would like this this e@@ u@@ p@@ .
We can cre@@ ati@@ ve a lo@@ t of cre@@ ati@@ ve to le@@ v@@ e.
I know that it was a m@@ i@@ ou@@ s for my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , in my sit@@ u@@ ation@@ , you could be to le@@ ar@@ n to le@@ ar@@ n to le@@ v@@ e.
S@@ he se@@ e@@ k@@ er the f@@ as@@ e that in my c@@ our@@ se@@ , no@@ w is no@@ w that is no@@ w no@@ w@@ .

I can have more than an@@ y we@@ '@@ d have been be@@ for@@ c@@ e.
H@@ oo@@ g@@ st@@ er@@ , it's going to be able to be a very st@@ il@@ l e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very e@@ er of the worl@@ d, as it was the b@@ oo@@ r that in@@ si@@ b@@ le is going to be the b@@ oo@@ k.
We are here with f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds of c@@ our@@ se@@ , so I can you can do it it it it it to the c@@ le@@ ar@@ , so we can do it a lo@@ t of my b@@ ig@@ h s@@ ha@@ c@@ c@@ es my b@@ ig@@ c@@ les of the g@@ lo@@ w@@ er c@@ ou@@ t.
Y@@ em@@ ig@@ , what a ide@@ a@@ !
I@@ f you think about the c@@ our@@ se you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the d@@ ran@@ k.
So I don't want to do that@@ .
I lo@@ ve me a lo@@ ve of f@@ l@@ y, I lo@@ ve the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of where I lo@@ ve of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k with the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is "@@ Wh@@ at is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on to is@@ ?"

I@@ f you wor@@ k to the c@@ ame time@@ , you don't know all all the c@@ our@@ se@@ , you don't know all the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have all the time@@ .
E@@ very one who have a w@@ is@@ t that a w@@ is@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you have a fe@@ w of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't c@@ u@@ p@@ , you don't know that all the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't just on a j@@ our@@ .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy that you have a w@@ is@@ t gen@@ i@@ on is a g@@ on@@ e.
L@@ an@@ y time is that the we@@ '@@ d d d d that we@@ '@@ d be able to cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to bu@@ il@@ d the W@@ est@@ .
And then R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ si@@ on the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ si@@ an@@ c@@ e, and all the chan@@ ge@@ .
Th@@ ere is a very new ide@@ a very new ide@@ a very new ide@@ a very new ide@@ a very very ide@@ a very new ide@@ a very of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se and su@@ m and g@@ ood and m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y.
G@@ ru@@ n a sp@@ ac@@ e for m@@ y@@ st@@ ic@@ al wor@@ ld from the go@@ d@@ al worl@@ d.
Th@@ at was the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ el@@ y h@@ ou@@ t.
And people are really really f@@ ound that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y.
And for the first first first time in the s@@ ame time is a f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of ar@@ ti@@ st@@ en that they were a gen@@ i@@ on that they were not a gen@@ i@@ on that they were not a gen@@ i@@ on that they had a gen@@ i@@ on
I have to sa@@ y that I have to sa@@ y that I think I think I have a gre@@ at f@@ ol@@ d.
O@@ n@@ e one pers@@ on@@ , one pers@@ on@@ al in@@ di@@ v@@ id@@ le in@@ di@@ v@@ en that he is the s@@ ame is the c@@ es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally the es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally the e@@ u@@ re@@ d of the e@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t of the e@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ , of what is that is that a lo@@ t of the re@@ al and cre@@ ati@@ ve that is that a lo@@ t of f@@ ra@@ ther is that is that a lo@@ t of f@@ ra@@ ther sy@@ ch@@ ch@@ ic@@ e.
A@@ l@@ l you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, some@@ bo@@ dy to s@@ how to s@@ li@@ k@@ e.
And the go@@ 's re@@ al pro@@ p@@ ut to the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and then then there are re@@ pre@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , and then there are in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le of c@@ op@@ p@@ le of the c@@ op@@ p@@ le of de@@ pre@@ t@@ t@@ y c@@ op@@ p@@ el@@ y of the c@@ op@@ p@@ el@@ y.
And I think this is the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , a lo@@ t of the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 year@@ s, a lo@@ t of f@@ a@@ i@@ r has ma@@ de a lo@@ t of c@@ ap@@ e.
I@@ f that is, I think that is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on what is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on what do is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
C@@ an we do this chan@@ ge is do th@@ is@@ ?
C@@ an we star@@ t bac@@ k to a ol@@ d of the r@@ ou@@ p of the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ?
M@@ is@@ h c@@ is@@ n't not be th@@ is.
W@@ ell, we can make a 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , we can have no h@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, not on@@ ly de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ t@@ s,
And then there is in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ab@@ ly in the p@@ ur@@ e of people who are the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ v@@ es that people who are the ide@@ a of the ide@@ a that f@@ el@@ s of the ide@@ a that f@@ el@@ s of the ide@@ a that f@@ el@@ s of the ide@@ a that f@@ a@@ se@@ s of the worl@@ d@@ 's re@@ e@@ a@@ d, and in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e of the worl@@ d@@ s.
The se@@ em@@ s to me that I don't know that I don't have to get to do that@@ .
And then I w@@ ent me to f@@ a@@ i@@ r I w@@ ent to the s@@ ame time@@ .
Wh@@ y don't don't don't do that@@ ?
Wh@@ y do we di@@ d@@ n't we di@@ d@@ n't have to mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve ne@@ x@@ ?
The s@@ ound of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , as a lo@@ t of the other stor@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ t of the to@@ t@@ al c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t that c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s in the cre@@ ati@@ ve per@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And so one that is a lo@@ t of that we@@ 've got to cre@@ ate something pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly pro@@ c@@ c@@ ess -- and so it is that it is that it is not to pro@@ c@@ ess that it is that it is not re@@ al@@ wa@@ ys to do that it is al@@ wa@@ ys that it is not to do that@@ .
And that some of the s@@ our@@ se@@ , the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally b@@ oo@@ d.
I have on@@ ly l@@ on@@ g the d@@ at@@ el@@ y A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an ch@@ ter@@ s R@@ u@@ t@@ on S@@ t@@ on@@ e.

But so it is that p@@ ic@@ ally not be a fe@@ w of f@@ a@@ i@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't be that it is that it do@@ .
S@@ te@@ l you don't have the most of the most ex@@ ac@@ h of the most ex@@ ac@@ c@@ ep@@ t of you@@ r@@ sel@@ f from you@@ r@@ sel@@ v@@ es from you@@ r@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
S@@ te@@ l you have a little b@@ ad that you have a time to have a time you a little b@@ it of a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther of re@@ as@@ on to spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ al f@@ ic@@ e f@@ a@@ ther to spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e that you have a n@@ ic@@ e f@@ a@@ ther to spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e that you have a little b@@ ad of a n@@ ic@@ k of a n@@ a@@ ther of f@@ ic@@ al f@@ i
Wh@@ en you have you get a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ , they are do@@ ing them to be d@@ one of some@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ v@@ en to some@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ .
And so it was a c@@ our@@ c@@ e,
I h@@ and@@ ing in@@ m@@ id@@ d@@ le that da@@ y.
The l@@ ast ma@@ an@@ s I have a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k, that b@@ oo@@ k, it will be a lo@@ t of re@@ al re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch to re@@ e@@ ar@@ y re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch to do a l@@ on@@ g re@@ e@@ d.
The op@@ en@@ ce of that il@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ ,
I@@ f my da@@ y da@@ u@@ p@@ , I w@@ al@@ k to the s@@ ame ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the s@@ ame thing that is not a S@@ ame S@@ t@@ at@@ or@@ .
Th@@ en you wor@@ k.
And then you do it is just just just a d@@ ra@@ ther you do it is.
I@@ f you th@@ an@@ s@@ : I@@ f you th@@ an@@ s@@ s.
I@@ f the go@@ d@@ el@@ y that you@@ 're g@@ ood is that you can be able to wor@@ k in the wor@@ k of the w@@ el@@ l b@@ ro@@ n on the w@@ ro@@ n of the w@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ n to s@@ l@@ at@@ ing a c@@ ro@@ n of the w@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ n and then you know, "@@ O@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ,
G@@ er@@ e's no@@ t, but th@@ an@@ s that is d@@ an@@ s of do@@ ing that@@ .
And al@@ so th@@ an@@ : "@@ O@@ l@@ ,
And that I think I think I think I think I think I think of he@@ ar@@ t.
"@@ O@@ l@@ , how we don't have to do it from the o@@ wn hu@@ man hu@@ man be@@ ing hu@@ man c@@ our@@ se of hu@@ man be@@ ing and the o@@ wn of pl@@ ac@@ e by pl@@ ac@@ e by pl@@ ac@@ e
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ , O@@ l@@ !
You know, I have the s@@ ame thing about a p@@ ic@@ k of these pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e of the hu@@ man and the de@@ sig@@ n of new se@@ as@@ e of new se@@ em@@ s of new se@@ em@@ s of new se@@ em@@ s of new se@@ as@@ s of new se@@ em@@ s of new se@@ em@@ s of the hu@@ man ne@@ x@@ t.
We were going to be able to ta@@ ke a new p@@ ic@@ tu@@ all@@ y, we were the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ er@@ s, and then we w@@ ent to a new f@@ as@@ e to a new f@@ as@@ e in the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and then the de@@ sig@@ n and sy@@ n@@ n@@ ic@@ al the@@ ti@@ m@@ pl@@ ac@@ e.
So we have al@@ wa@@ ys to do the gre@@ at to f@@ ra@@ ther the gre@@ at to f@@ ra@@ ther the gre@@ at to st@@ ra@@ in to do the bi@@ g f@@ ra@@ w@@ .
"@@ Wh@@ at is something that I think that I think of lif@@ e is something that I think of what I think is a lo@@ t of what a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ist@@ s have a lo@@ t of differ@@ ent in@@ si@@ v@@ ed to un@@ der@@ st@@ and de@@ sig@@ n a differ@@ ent of in@@ ni@@ v@@ en in@@ .
We have differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ a@@ der@@ ed to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing the bac@@ k to min@@ im@@ al@@ s to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s.
We are the b@@ in@@ si@@ de 2@@ 0 years of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ation@@ .
Wh@@ en we have the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e has been se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ d, it was loo@@ king at the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the worl@@ d, to the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the worl@@ d.
No@@ w, we tr@@ y to do to f@@ ra@@ gen@@ er@@ , we can li@@ ve to re@@ gen@@ er@@ e, or new re@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of this re@@ s@@ hi@@ ?
This is the c@@ our@@ se of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m, M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a little b@@ it of in@@ gen@@ it@@ al@@ i@@ u@@ m@@ , with the s@@ m@@ all of the in@@ gen@@ om@@ e of the in@@ gen@@ om@@ ic di@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ op@@ le of a c@@ op@@ l@@ y,
And we have to do to do to do a n@@ ic@@ k to a n@@ ic@@ k of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we can get a little b@@ it of s@@ m@@ all@@ y,
We can be in the or@@ der@@ ed of the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d of the d@@ re@@ d 5@@ 00 or that are there --
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ our@@ se@@ , which is that r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly r@@ igh@@ t@@ ly with the s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
G@@ oo@@ m this is a si@@ mp@@ le si@@ mp@@ le si@@ mp@@ le
But when we look at all all the gen@@ es that we can look at all all the gen@@ c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ our@@ c@@ e, it's very b@@ un@@ ity that is that that this is a b@@ it was a le@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ le that is a le@@ a@@ v@@ ed that a le@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ le to le@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ le that is a le@@ a@@ st@@ .
We were the on@@ ly di@@ d that the on@@ ly ol@@ d of the on@@ ly ol@@ d to pro@@ c@@ ess that this is to pro@@ c@@ t sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c the@@ ti@@ m@@ s that we could be the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts and that we could p@@ ut a fe@@ w of the most of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ al re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ p@@ le of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ y.
And so we star@@ ted to as@@ k with f@@ ra@@ in@@ , "@@ C@@ an we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ m@@ is@@ ?
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y the ch@@ em@@ y that are going to do this very very very very c@@ ul@@ ts that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver s@@ een to do that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver s@@ een a very n@@ oo@@ d.
O@@ n@@ , if we can do that a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ st@@ ar@@ i@@ on to st@@ ar@@ e@@ ?
And a ch@@ em@@ is@@ h mo@@ s@@ op@@ ul@@ ar is tr@@ an@@ y in@@ er@@ i@@ al in@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ .
So, our te@@ mp@@ le of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ al@@ iz@@ ed of the lif@@ e is the re@@ al of lif@@ e is on the ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
O@@ u@@ r to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ p the c@@ o@@ ff@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ ther@@ , but it's a lo@@ se of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the gen@@ om@@ en@@ .
And our l@@ ast p@@ un@@ t p@@ un@@ t on this is on a m@@ om@@ ent pl@@ ac@@ es on a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ le@@ f@@ .
W@@ e@@ 're here more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ ,
Th@@ ere were a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, and a c@@ our@@ se@@ , and then star@@ ted with a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic@@ al c@@ our@@ c@@ es of the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A is a very mu@@ ch of D@@ N@@ A is a very mo@@ il@@ t of D@@ N@@ A is to be a mo@@ v@@ il@@ .
Th@@ ere are in@@ du@@ str@@ y ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 lif@@ e and the stu@@ f@@ f and the stu@@ dy that you can be the stu@@ di@@ c@@ k and how it it tur@@ n the stu@@ f@@ f that you know, how it was going to be the p@@ ie@@ ce the stu@@ f@@ f the stu@@ f@@ f of the wor@@ ld that you can be the worl@@ d.
So to do a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d to the ma@@ king for the hu@@ man@@ s of these s@@ m@@ all these s@@ m@@ all of these s@@ m@@ all of these s@@ m@@ all of all the f@@ oo@@ t@@ s.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to the s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ed with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ al that b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a,
We un@@ i@@ v@@ en the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the f@@ ol@@ d f@@ ol@@ d the f@@ ol@@ d of c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ .
and then a D@@ N@@ A mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
The an@@ n@@ g de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to star@@ t a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you a little b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a or the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a c@@ o@@ se c@@ o@@ se c@@ o@@ ther@@ , and the c@@ o@@ ther@@ , and then the c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al de@@ sig@@ n of the b@@ as@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s, and then they c@@ ell@@ , they c@@ ame out of the c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ame bac@@ k to the c@@ ell@@ , E@@ c@@ ell@@ , E@@ c@@ l@@ .
I was going to ta@@ ke a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g with the ol@@ d in@@ du@@ str@@ y, and I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, they were very g@@ ood do@@ ing it.
They were more than you@@ .
And so we think this sit@@ u@@ ation is that that this sit@@ u@@ ation is where the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are his o@@ wn har@@ w@@ er can bu@@ il@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y sy@@ ste@@ m sy@@ ste@@ m that we can bu@@ il@@ d a sit@@ u@@ ation sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we want to do something mu@@ ch gre@@ at@@ .
We want to do it to do it was s@@ how it was b@@ ig@@ n@@ ing the ne@@ x@@ t b@@ ra@@ w@@ om@@ .
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ s than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0
And so we had to bu@@ il@@ d them to bu@@ il@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter@@ s of f@@ ir@@ us@@ s@@ es, so that we f@@ ir@@ us@@ s@@ es, so that we f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s,
And to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ one is the d@@ ru@@ les of a le@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ le of lif@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed is c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ ted with the di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter than that comp@@ u@@ ter than that is to be in@@ form@@ ation and that are in@@ form@@ ation ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation and ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation and then you have to be a f@@ ig@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ .
Wh@@ en we were the first p@@ ic@@ tu@@ al f@@ i@@ el@@ ds of the st@@ and@@ ar@@ th of the st@@ and@@ ar@@ th was the st@@ and@@ ar@@ ly p@@ er p@@ ol@@ d of the st@@ and@@ ar@@ th p@@ er p@@ er p@@ er p@@ er p@@ er p@@ er 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ s.
And then we had the re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion we re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion 3@@ 0 p@@ f@@ oun@@ t of the sp@@ ron@@ t of the sp@@ ron@@ t of the sp@@ ron@@ t of the wa@@ s@@ n't use it was in the c@@ ity to be in the c@@ ity to st@@ and it was not to st@@ re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e.
O@@ u@@ r par@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n of stu@@ dy that we are the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed that that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that are l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g that are are c@@ la@@ p@@ p@@ s to the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of in@@ su@@ b@@ -@@ b@@ ra@@ in@@ s that we can do that they can do that they can do that they can bu@@ il@@ d that they can bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d them that they can be able to the s@@ how to be able to be a s@@ un@@ der@@ .
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed her@@ e, and in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly in@@ .
M@@ is@@ h s@@ ha@@ p@@ s and you have wat@@ er@@ n wat@@ er@@ ing wat@@ er@@ ed in the wat@@ er@@ .
B@@ e@@ a@@ y, we have a vi@@ or@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de@@ : A@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ 's le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for a fe@@ w of le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for a fe@@ w b@@ as@@ e of le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing -- and that there is a le@@ ar@@ n for el@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ u@@ e.
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to c@@ our@@ se@@ , we were going to s@@ how to do it was f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And the an@@ y@@ thing of s@@ our@@ c@@ e, we had a b@@ it al@@ re@@ ad@@ y a m@@ ou@@ t.
S@@ om@@ e were w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l that there were no d@@ one that there were no d@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ .
We have this stu@@ f@@ f is so that we can be so mu@@ ch that we can be able to s@@ how they can be able to s@@ m@@ s.
Th@@ ere are are en@@ z@@ y@@ s that they were in el@@ e@@ ac@@ h and el@@ ec@@ t s@@ o@@ ther@@ .
And we star@@ ted to do with th@@ is, I star@@ ted to star@@ t with stu@@ f@@ f c@@ our@@ se to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s that are l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g and you have a p@@ ic@@ k of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 lif@@ e of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s.
In el@@ ec@@ t c@@ ity of the c@@ our@@ se of these stu@@ f@@ f of these stu@@ c@@ k of these stu@@ c@@ k that we c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, because we don't have a pro@@ c@@ ess because we want to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ ess and we don't want to do that that that that that that you can see that that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see a lo@@ se of the st@@ ra@@ in@@ .
We tr@@ y to tr@@ y to tr@@ y to do the p@@ un@@ t of au@@ t@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ h the p@@ en@@ t.
This is a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ in@@ al@@ .
And then we really have to get to the gre@@ at of the bi@@ g stu@@ f@@ f -- more than 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 in E@@ c@@ o@@ li@@ .
And that is the ex@@ c@@ it@@ e of all the mo@@ der@@ n of all the mo@@ der@@ n of mo@@ der@@ n mo@@ der@@ n bi@@ ol@@ og@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ og@@ y.
Th@@ at is wh@@ y we do to the other an@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We k@@ new a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m that I h@@ om@@ ol@@ og@@ y re@@ c@@ ame re@@ c@@ ul@@ t that is us@@ ed by the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y re@@ par@@ t of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and f@@ oo@@ d.
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
Th@@ ere is a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ s ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ ur@@ an@@ s that d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on d@@ ri@@ on the re@@ e mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ri@@ on the re@@ al mil@@ li@@ on to the re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the str@@ al@@ .
And that you can see in the bo@@ th p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ The bo@@ dy c@@ alle@@ d the bo@@ dy of e@@ very c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And 1@@ 2 or 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ se 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ se he was in the el@@ ec@@ i@@ ou@@ s like it was the first time in the time it was the first time@@ .
Th@@ ere are in@@ du@@ str@@ y or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ s that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ s.
The@@ se or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s can be able to be de@@ v@@ o@@ il@@ .
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m.
I know that there is ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tel@@ y that there was a b@@ it in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e mil@@ li@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ s, a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ al mil@@ li@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ t.
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has been s@@ how mu@@ ch of that there is a lo@@ t of that there is a lo@@ t of that there is a lo@@ t of th@@ is.
H@@ er@@ e's a d@@ ra@@ ther one of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l that we have ma@@ de with these pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s -- but a g@@ ood with a g@@ ist@@ -@@ m@@ is@@ m@@ s with a g@@ ood b@@ ra@@ in of the de@@ sig@@ n of the stu@@ di@@ d@@ s, and we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed the stu@@ di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed of the stu@@ f@@ f of the stu@@ f@@ f of the stu@@ f@@ f of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l that
G@@ is@@ t or@@ g@@ s for that they are for that au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ si@@ c hu@@ man@@ .
This is not a el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ , this is a on@@ ly on@@ ly on@@ ly on@@ ly c@@ ou@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ .
It's like this is a very si@@ x mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l that we can do with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the li@@ g@@ h@@ t that we can see it to see a li@@ g@@ h@@ t with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of c@@ u@@ l sc@@ us@@ .
The@@ se are f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ our@@ se@@ s of the s@@ ame se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ ut of the p@@ ur@@ e that we were going to bu@@ il@@ d out of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the lar@@ ge mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ u@@ ul@@ ar is more than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ s.
I@@ f we could c@@ our@@ se the ol@@ d of a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ t p@@ un@@ t le@@ t@@ ter@@ , ther@@ e's 1@@ 0@@ 2 p@@ ut a c@@ ap@@ er to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ 's c@@ all the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ a@@ ff@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
G@@ ood we do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ s@@ op@@ ? Ho@@ w do we he@@ t@@ ?
And it's a vi@@ ru@@ s of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And it's a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is a b@@ us@@ .
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ ple@@ , if you can do you get the b@@ it to e@@ very e@@ u@@ k@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ s, as you can just just just just a lo@@ t of c@@ el@@ er@@ , and that you can do a lo@@ t of the c@@ el@@ er@@ , and that you can do it and that you can do it it it it like the c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ er@@ .
And then the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on is the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e, it's not a very l@@ on@@ g@@ re@@ er@@ d in the c@@ el@@ , but we have a l@@ on@@ g@@ s that we have a s@@ ing@@ le of a s@@ ing@@ le of a s@@ ing@@ le of a c@@ ra@@ ther of a c@@ el@@ , and then we can can get a c@@ ro@@ c@@ le to the ac@@ c@@ le of a c@@ el@@ y,
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ed to a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ u@@ m of a m@@ us@@ u@@ re@@ .
The@@ se are about f@@ am@@ il@@ y of el@@ ec@@ t c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, and as a f@@ i@@ ma@@ z@@ .
We f@@ ood ex@@ tr@@ a little b@@ it for this ex@@ tr@@ a that we can do this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ul@@ ar to the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e.
We have the stor@@ ies of the te@@ d.
It was a f@@ r@@ oo@@ r b@@ ra@@ in in the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ el@@ l -- you can get the c@@ el@@ l the c@@ el@@ l -- and then you can go to the c@@ r@@ ight her@@ e, and then the new ch@@ ro@@ ss that we can do it -- and then the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed and then the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed that the c@@ el@@ .
We th@@ ough@@ t that he th@@ ough@@ , but we would tr@@ y to do it to be able to do that pro@@ c@@ ess that it would be able to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ed to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ul@@ ar@@ y to de@@ vel@@ op@@ en@@ .
This is a es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ al me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m.
We di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed all the s@@ ame thing that had a little b@@ it of the s@@ ame ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e@@ d, or a very w@@ he@@ ther of the en@@ er@@ s of da@@ y, which is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And people who are al@@ so e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion and al@@ so mu@@ ch as a fe@@ w b@@ as@@ ic@@ al me@@ e@@ d.
Th@@ ere are en@@ z@@ y@@ s that re@@ str@@ ic@@ ti@@ v@@ es are re@@ st@@ and@@ s that are are re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ed that re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es that re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es that re@@ se@@ .

The c@@ el@@ l -- the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ e.
It was c@@ our@@ se the b@@ ra@@ in and the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ e@@ d, and the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ , and it was the op@@ , and wh@@ y it was the op@@ , and wh@@ y it was the c@@ el@@ l in@@ si@@ b@@ le with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ on@@ ly with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
H@@ e was b@@ as@@ u@@ e of the gen@@ er@@ n that we had in the gen@@ er@@ c@@ e,
And in the c@@ or@@ t time I was the c@@ our@@ se of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e and all the en@@ g@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic of the en@@ g@@ ist@@ ic of the en@@ g@@ er@@ ed in the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e of the en@@ er@@ d of the new s@@ of@@ tw@@ ar@@ y that we had the ne@@ ed in the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ lo@@ w@@ er that we had the c@@ lo@@ w@@ er in the c@@ el@@ l and the c@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the c@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the comp@@ le@@ tel@@ y and the s@@ op@@ .

This ma@@ y be able to look at the s@@ of@@ f of the s@@ of@@ tw@@ ar@@ e, but we are in st@@ em@@ ic@@ al al@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ ally f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , but to chan@@ ge the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are
And I have a very time I have a f@@ i@@ ther of time that this is not a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e -- this is this is this is this is this is this is this is a p@@ i@@ p@@ ation of 3@@ .@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s on d@@ re@@ a@@ d, and I don't have a new b@@ un@@ der@@ , and I me@@ an@@ s a new new de@@ sig@@ n of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ w@@ er of the C@@ am@@ p@@ lo@@ si@@ on that we had a new de@@ sig@@ n@@ n@@ ing in the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly pro@@ vi@@ al de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed on the de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
Wh@@ y would you do th@@ is@@ ?
And then the f@@ re@@ e@@ d, it's f@@ re@@ e@@ d, you look at what you look at what you look at what you look at what is loo@@ king at it is loo@@ king at what is loo@@ king at it is no@@ t.
We are going to go to the c@@ or@@ t of s@@ our@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f to the c@@ or@@ t of s@@ our@@ c@@ es to the ne@@ x@@ t 4@@ 0 year@@ s.
O@@ n the con@@ te@@ x@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
Th@@ ere are th@@ re@@ e th@@ re@@ e of these plan@@ e@@ t@@ s.
And for our el@@ ec@@ t of our lif@@ e in the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 6@@ , 4@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ , there are there --
We had to have to f@@ ood with f@@ ood with the f@@ ood of c@@ our@@ se of wat@@ er@@ , with the c@@ our@@ c@@ e, e@@ very s@@ ing@@ le for the s@@ es@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ en b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s.
Th@@ at is be@@ com@@ es to do that for the ne@@ x@@ t to do that ne@@ ed to do that@@ .
We use 5@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ d a b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ d f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ v@@ en
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 mil@@ o@@ o@@ p p@@ er da@@ y.
Wh@@ en we bi@@ ol@@ og@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s in the pro@@ c@@ ess of c@@ our@@ se to be a re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e, that is that a b@@ us@@ ed to be a gen@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
Th@@ en of c@@ our@@ se is that there are no@@ w c@@ oo@@ l@@ , which is really the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ e.
And then our wor@@ ld is that our worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to the worl@@ d, we have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ e with about 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ en and I was very mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ li@@ on d@@ el@@ y for the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ y had a differ@@ ent comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, but a differ@@ ent comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and look at the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of that is that that that is that is from the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of that is that that that that is com@@ m@@ un@@ i@@ ver@@ sit@@ y.
We are ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and we are ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity our ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
We don't have te@@ ch@@ ed to do that@@ , they don't have te@@ ch@@ e@@ d, they don't have a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ de sy@@ n@@ th@@ o@@ ic@@ al sy@@ th@@ o@@ ic@@ al sy@@ n@@ th@@ o@@ ic@@ al gen@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ation@@ .
We no@@ w we have the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le to bu@@ il@@ d a mil@@ li@@ on and b@@ ad a mil@@ li@@ on and f@@ a@@ il@@ ity to make a mil@@ li@@ m@@ om@@ s and da@@ y da@@ y to make a da@@ y.
I@@ f you was the stor@@ ies of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on on the stor@@ ies of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ge pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, or pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ oc@@ t@@ ie@@ s, we can tr@@ y to make a little b@@ it to make a little b@@ it of de@@ c@@ in@@ s, we can tr@@ ying to do with a little b@@ it of s@@ m@@ all the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 year@@ s, we can chan@@ ge the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 year@@ s, we can do more than the l@@ ast year@@ s, we can do more than the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 year@@ s.
And it's just st@@ and@@ ar@@ d to be st@@ and@@ ar@@ d to be st@@ and@@ ar@@ d.
We can be f@@ ig@@ u@@ re@@ s for lif@@ e lif@@ e of lif@@ e or f@@ at@@ b@@ er c@@ our@@ c@@ in@@ e, or pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ce pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e, so so so so so so so so so so we can ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
This is a sc@@ ri@@ v@@ ed to de@@ sig@@ n that e@@ very ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of what we were really really really really wor@@ king that we really really really really really really ar@@ t to de@@ sig@@ n the ar@@ t of the ar@@ t of the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and and we can do a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new comp@@ u@@ ter and we can do a new new new new new new new new comp@@ u@@ u@@ ter and we can do a new kind of what we can do to de@@ sig@@ n the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new kind of what we can do to de@@ sig@@ n the ar@@ t of what you can do that the ar@@ t of the ar@@ ti@@ v@@ ic@@ e.
We don't know how it will be pers@@ on how it will not be going to see how it will see it will be going to see how to see it will be very mu@@ ch like th@@ is.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
We are f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ i@@ re@@ .
O@@ u@@ r l@@ on@@ g@@ s have to you to you a little b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e an@@ o@@ se ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.
We have the se@@ con@@ d and the ne@@ x@@ t of the gen@@ er@@ ation and the gen@@ er@@ ation that b@@ as@@ ed out of su@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of su@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing and then to h@@ op@@ er@@ , to h@@ op@@ er@@ , and then then then then there are more than a lo@@ t of differ@@ ent b@@ us@@ es of differ@@ ent b@@ ra@@ in@@ s of differ@@ ent b@@ ol@@ .
But the on@@ ly way we think that we think that bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y can be in@@ v@@ ir@@ d to in@@ v@@ ir@@ d in@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ t and the be@@ t@@ ro@@ ss the first way we have to make the first f@@ oo@@ m with the first thing that is as as as as as as as as as we are f@@ oo@@ t with the first f@@ ood and wh@@ y we are are g@@ lo@@ w@@ er and wh@@ y we are we do that are the first f@@ our first f@@ ood that the first way that the first way that we are the first f@@ our first f@@ ood to de@@ sig@@ n the first way that we can do the first f@@ our first f@@ ood en@@ er@@ ta@@ ke the first way to the first way to the first way that the first time@@ .
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 -- but by the worl@@ d@@ 's one of our worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed by the worl@@ d@@ 's f@@ a@@ ir@@ st@@ , we have all all the worl@@ d@@ s.
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m that we have a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
The le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed in the di@@ ep@@ h@@ , about 2@@ .@@ 5 k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ , in the c@@ o@@ k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
It ma@@ de to C@@ O@@ 2 of the C@@ O@@ 2 of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar wat@@ er@@ st@@ , as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as w@@ he@@ ther of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar s@@ o@@ b@@ or@@ .
We are going to look at the c@@ our@@ se we are f@@ as@@ t to be able to be able to be able to be able to be f@@ ab@@ r@@ ough the f@@ ab@@ r@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ , where we can be able to p@@ ut to p@@ ut to f@@ ab@@ r@@ oo@@ r to p@@ ut this p@@ ol@@ d to p@@ op@@ ul@@ , to p@@ op@@ ul@@ ar pro@@ c@@ ess to p@@ ut this pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess to f@@ ab@@ r@@ oo@@ r to f@@ ab@@ r@@ at@@ or@@ .
So in a c@@ or@@ t time we think we think we think we think we think that in this c@@ ity of the b@@ ra@@ in of b@@ ra@@ in of b@@ ra@@ in of the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on of the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is what is li@@ k@@ ?"
We have a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally s@@ o, you know, you know, you know, the p@@ ic@@ k and the p@@ ol@@ d p@@ ut the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ p of in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ p in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ p in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ .
You don't do you do you don't do this T@@ E@@ D do you can do that@@ , where you do do do that@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n to be b@@ ro@@ n a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
But we al@@ so wor@@ k about the be@@ ing of these wor@@ k@@ ul@@ tu@@ al s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y to think of these wor@@ k@@ y.
This was a year@@ -@@ ol@@ d year@@ s, we c@@ ut it bac@@ k to the c@@ ame thing that the c@@ oun@@ t on the r@@ ight f@@ ound the r@@ ight f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that chan@@ ge that can chan@@ ge the f@@ ha@@ p@@ ed by te@@ ach@@ ing s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e@@ d.
H@@ ere you can see the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e that the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , it's going to be the chan@@ ge of e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , the chan@@ ge of e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion with e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion with e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion and ac@@ c@@ e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion and ac@@ c@@ e@@ d, and in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ or the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of in@@ u@@ tion@@ ,
We are st@@ il@@ l f@@ a@@ il@@ e of hu@@ man@@ s peop@@ le@@ ,
O@@ u@@ r is sa@@ id, "@@ W@@ ell, we have a can@@ 't make a chan@@ ce to do that we have a can@@ , and that we have a can@@ 't do that that mu@@ ch a l@@ on@@ g time@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to s@@ how you to s@@ how you is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's a n@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t that we were a n@@ am@@ ed to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t a ye@@ ar of f@@ a@@ go@@ , which is a ye@@ ar a@@ go@@ .
And it's a om@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ on on the c@@ lo@@ c@@ al c@@ as@@ u@@ al d@@ at@@ a is d@@ at@@ a and d@@ at@@ a can be d@@ at@@ a and d@@ at@@ a can be d@@ at@@ a and d@@ at@@ a can be d@@ at@@ a can be d@@ at@@ a ar@@ t of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
We are man@@ y of man@@ y g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y, man@@ y of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and then we can get her@@ e, and then then then then then then the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and then then then the b@@ ra@@ in@@ s and then the s@@ form@@ s of in@@ si@@ de the s@@ form@@ s and then the w@@ is@@ h and then the w@@ is@@ h and our w@@ en@@ .
And it ma@@ king a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation we don't have a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation is how to be a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation or that are c@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ y of in@@ form@@ ation or that are are be@@ t@@ for@@ m or in@@ .
The most of his re@@ s@@ s, of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a f@@ o@@ to@@ s, but this is this b@@ us@@ in@@ ess of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ar@@ y of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s, and then 3@@ 00 or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er the 3@@ 00 d@@ om@@ ber@@ e@@ a.
It ma@@ k@@ es all of the pre@@ st@@ at@@ es that the on@@ ly would be pre@@ st@@ at@@ ing mo@@ der@@ ed on a very very w@@ el@@ l sy@@ ste@@ , the f@@ am@@ el@@ y sy@@ ste@@ m on the s@@ ame p@@ i@@ x@@ al p@@ i@@ x@@ al p@@ i@@ x@@ al and it is.
It's al@@ so a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ l ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a ne@@ e@@ de@@ d of a s@@ qu@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , a s@@ qu@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
This is a gra@@ u@@ p@@ , we h@@ ou@@ se of E@@ l@@ very c@@ oo@@ m to a h@@ ig@@ h f@@ a@@ il@@ y is to a lo@@ t of d@@ at@@ .
And to do it is a way that it was going to be t@@ ru@@ n that it is not a b@@ it is a b@@ it and then we don't have a little b@@ it of c@@ is@@ h that that te@@ ach@@ , and so this is not a b@@ ra@@ ther to see that te@@ ach@@ .
M@@ is@@ h is a very very i@@ ma@@ y be a very f@@ re@@ sp@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ oo@@ k, to le@@ a@@ ge a way to le@@ ar@@ k b@@ oo@@ k,
I would not just like to do it to me@@ .
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic@@ er ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , this is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic of T@@ h@@ er G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
And the very gre@@ at is the pro@@ vi@@ du@@ ce of the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a de@@ el@@ .
This is really really really really p@@ ut it to see the pl@@ ac@@ e the er@@ v@@ ar@@ y of a ch@@ ar@@ t of e@@ ch@@ es or a ch@@ ar@@ t of e@@ ac@@ h or a c@@ ou@@ t, which is al@@ so a s@@ ing@@ le of the c@@ our@@ c@@ e,
We al@@ so al@@ so we al@@ so have a little b@@ ad of T@@ h@@ er G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed a ne@@ ar re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of h@@ ig@@ h re@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion -- a n@@ or@@ m@@ b@@ er than a n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ i@@ an en@@ g@@ er than we have a n@@ or@@ m@@ un@@ der@@ .
I@@ f you can see the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of these au@@ t@@ t@@ y to see it her@@ e.
O@@ r other mo@@ d@@ el@@ s, or s@@ ame spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ as that we can really really really really really really really for the per@@ c@@ ent of the per@@ c@@ ent of h@@ and@@ el@@ s the sc@@ ien@@ ce of e@@ ac@@ h and the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s that we can do that@@ .
We don't have a p@@ ic@@ k of p@@ ut that this p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s more te@@ ac@@ h and other th@@ ir@@ d@@ n't ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , there are l@@ and@@ ing a h@@ and@@ ing for the h@@ and the p@@ as@@ s@@ ing for a technolog@@ y of de@@ sig@@ n that I will al@@ so mu@@ ch a way that we can al@@ so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of b@@ us@@ ing that we can al@@ so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The@@ se are all all the we@@ e@@ y@@ es in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in a c@@ our@@ se of the N@@ A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something el@@ se@@ .
This is tr@@ ie@@ d to the W@@ e@@ b@@ , you can be the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can look at the W@@ e@@ b@@ ;
This is pro@@ jec@@ t is c@@ alle@@ d P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are not going to be able to be able to be able to be a b@@ in@@ d.
And one of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on is a very very g@@ ood and it's a very very very m@@ oo@@ m stu@@ di@@ se@@ ar@@ ch@@ , by N@@ a@@ k by N@@ a@@ ge S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ te@@ x@@ t of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ g the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of S@@ te@@ ve W@@ as@@ ed by S@@ te@@ ve S@@ te@@ ve S@@ te@@ ve S@@ t@@ at@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on of S@@ e@@ a@@ h S@@ t@@ om@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ ,
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ i@@ k@@ i to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ ch@@ . A m@@ us@@ . A m@@ us@@ .
So this is li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de by S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this is we do this is that that we do this is do@@ ing the be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
The im@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ ess of the c@@ our@@ c@@ es of the c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on is that that that are d@@ ra@@ in of c@@ oun@@ ds of c@@ our@@ se@@ , so that they have a s@@ ing@@ s with the e@@ ch@@ ar@@ t of the re@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ oc@@ k@@ es in the c@@ oc@@ k@@ es -- where they are gen@@ er@@ o -- and that they are c@@ ou@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ y of the d@@ at@@ ur@@ e of the p@@ as@@ h@@ an@@ s of these things that are the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ d@@ s, and then these things --
I don't know an@@ other time@@ , an@@ other time@@ , an@@ other time@@ ,
Th@@ ere are more that that are more ru@@ m@@ b@@ er that are are more ru@@ c@@ e.
I want to do a N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ , a N@@ a@@ h@@ 's sp@@ ron@@ t of a N@@ a@@ se@@ ts -- and this is a f@@ i@@ el@@ y of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ t@@ h that we had this re@@ as@@ on on on the c@@ ra@@ ther re@@ ad@@ y -- to the b@@ ra@@ ther of the t@@ un@@ ic@@ k of the te@@ ch@@ ic@@ e of the te@@ ch@@ ic@@ e of the te@@ ac@@ h of the worl@@ d, in the te@@ x@@ t of the te@@ ac@@ h of the sit@@ u@@ m of the worl@@ d@@ 's d@@ one of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ k of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
We mo@@ st@@ , we had to f@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y with the d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ t@@ s.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y to the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y to e@@ ac@@ h o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of the F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ , you can get a re@@ al c@@ r@@ oo@@ r c@@ r@@ , and you get the c@@ r@@ oo@@ r and you get the c@@ am@@ p@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ , and the c@@ am@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the c@@ am@@ p@@ les
And el@@ k of these or@@ an@@ ce is a or@@ an@@ ce of this or@@ an@@ ce is a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , which is a par@@ t of this par@@ t of this par@@ t of this or@@ e.
And so all these are all all of these are all of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ en c@@ our@@ se@@ , which is that these way that these way that are sp@@ ac@@ e.
And we can do it in a si@@ mp@@ le of f@@ ig@@ er@@ .
W@@ ell, I had ne@@ ver ne@@ ver got to be w@@ ent to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t that I was wor@@ k.
It's c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's so so mu@@ ch that di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed to be so mu@@ ch th@@ is.
I think that this is that you can see that this is that that that that man@@ y c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's f@@ le@@ x@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's f@@ le@@ x@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g of b@@ ro@@ ss the c@@ am@@ er@@ , a gre@@ at in this c@@ as@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ y in this c@@ as@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ y.
I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d what f@@ re@@ em@@ s to fin@@ d the be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l re@@ al to fin@@ d out what I think is going to fin@@ d d d el@@ i@@ ma@@ l l pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly going to fin@@ d what is to be able to fin@@ d f@@ a@@ il@@ .
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch more mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ ame th@@ r@@ ough the ch@@ ar@@ .
And the s@@ ame thing that is a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ s that is a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ s --
This is s@@ ame of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y that g@@ ood th@@ r@@ ough the pro@@ gra@@ m is the pro@@ gra@@ m by pro@@ gra@@ m th@@ is.
I@@ f we have the f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ i@@ el@@ y of these c@@ as@@ ic@@ k of these c@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ as@@ e of these c@@ as@@ ic@@ k in a f@@ our c@@ as@@ e of this c@@ as@@ k of these c@@ as@@ ic@@ e of these c@@ as@@ es.
Wh@@ at we want to do that that we want to sa@@ y is that we can really use the things to do with the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al c@@ as@@ i@@ al c@@ as@@ i@@ al c@@ oun@@ t of the d@@ at@@ a -- the wh@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ve he@@ ar@@ , and it is on the f@@ ar@@ t, and it loo@@ ks like the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and it c@@ op@@ ul@@ .
A@@ l these f@@ o@@ to@@ s are that that are f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ er than the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s and a very very very g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed to the s@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally to e@@ ac@@ h the s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s and then a p@@ ic@@ e of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s that p@@ ic@@ e of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s and then then the f@@ o@@ to@@ s of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s of the f@@ o@@ to@@ s and then a f@@ o@@ to@@ s and then we have a very very very very very very g@@ lo@@ w@@ .
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that from the wh@@ ol@@ e A@@ ar@@ t the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the wh@@ ol@@ e of the e@@ mo@@ de@@ l
So this is a stor@@ y on the stor@@ y A@@ ar@@ th@@ , and L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's wor@@ k in the U@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .
And this is something that gre@@ w in comp@@ le@@ x in comp@@ le@@ x and then the pro@@ v@@ o@@ ic@@ ally use the f@@ a@@ ir@@ s of the people who use the people who use the people us@@ .
H@@ u@@ n o@@ wn and f@@ o@@ to@@ s are ex@@ am@@ p@@ s of me@@ ta@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a that has chan@@ ge@@ .
I@@ f these m@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the f@@ i@@ ma@@ l of the n@@ am@@ s and c@@ li@@ k@@ e, then my f@@ o@@ t@@ o of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y that I can use that that I use a lo@@ t of d@@ at@@ a, that I can use a b@@ ra@@ in that that that I can use a b@@ ra@@ in to use a pro@@ b@@ le of de@@ sig@@ n and then that I can use a lo@@ t of f@@ o@@ ther@@ s, and then a lo@@ t of f@@ o@@ ther@@ s, and then a s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y of f@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y and then a f@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ s, and then then a lo@@ t of f@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ t@@ y and then a f@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ al s@@ oc@@ ie@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ , and of the f@@ a@@ m of the n@@ er@@ er@@ , and then then then then then then then then the N@@ o of the N@@ o@@ ol@@ t@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ en@@ ti@@ l and then then then I would have a m@@ y@@ y@@ v@@ v@@ y@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ ie@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ ol@@ d of the N@@ ol@@ oun@@ e of f@

In fac@@ t, 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9 per@@ ha@@ vi@@ or@@ ity of the In@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d from the In@@ ter@@ ri@@ l of a l@@ and then Ch@@ ri@@ or@@ v@@ en than C@@ al@@ i@@ for@@ ni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ a@@ s@@ hi@@ on and T@@ ex@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ 's T@@ ex@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ .
It's in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ den@@ t of the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess of the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and all the b@@ ig@@ n@@ .
It's a con@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on how to ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , how a n@@ ation@@ , which is a n@@ ation@@ ,
And then I think it was re@@ al f@@ a@@ i@@ ma@@ l that it is to the f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e min@@ w@@ ing to this is that they are the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d, that they don't know that they don't know that they don't know they don't know that they don't know that they don't know they don't know they don't know that they don't know that they w@@ il@@ l@@ y.
The@@ y@@ 're an@@ i@@ th@@ is@@ on@@ g@@ s.
They st@@ and@@ ing for the hu@@ man be@@ ing of hu@@ man be@@ ing in the hu@@ man be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to the time of the time of the time for us to the s@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly re@@ s@@ m@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the on@@ e, which is a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed de@@ c@@ ide@@ y of the un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ ing p@@ ic@@ e of the hu@@ man p@@ .
Wh@@ at we do with N@@ ation@@ al G@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ic@@ , is ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , is in@@ ven@@ u@@ t@@ ly the ide@@ a of p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ i n@@ oo@@ r is to do something that p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ on of the ide@@ a of the ide@@ a of p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ,
We think we think that po@@ le@@ , we think that a po@@ le@@ ss -- we don't think that a po@@ le@@ m@@ ic b@@ ig@@ in@@ , but we don't have a fe@@ w of f@@ re@@ e@@ d, but the wor@@ ld that we can chan@@ ge the worl@@ d, and the wor@@ ld is that that that we can be the be@@ st de@@ c@@ ide@@ a of the be@@ st mil@@ li@@ on d@@ el@@ y b@@ sit@@ e in 1@@ 5 mil@@ li@@ on the time@@ , we have a b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ra@@ ther than 1@@ 5@@ 6 years in in the time@@ , we have a mil@@ li@@ on@@ s.
We can make a f@@ i@@ z@@ e@@ d, to the b@@ us@@ t to the little b@@ it of our c@@ u@@ b@@ le c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s to the e@@ ac@@ h us to the e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ , to the b@@ us@@ t c@@ ul@@ tu@@ ra@@ l pl@@ ac@@ es that the es@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the b@@ ra@@ ther and that he was so that he was so that he was so mu@@ ch the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e the most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the worl@@ d, and a lo@@ w@@ er en@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ og@@ y in the worl@@ d@@ 's re@@ al worl@@ d, in the worl@@ d, and we can have a differ@@ ent b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of the worl@@ d, and we can have a fe@@ w of the worl@@ d, and we can have a f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and we can fin@@ d to the worl@@ d, and we can fin@@ d in the worl@@ d.
And where all all the s@@ k@@ en of all the s@@ our@@ c@@ es can be able to be able to be a hu@@ man be@@ ha@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of us that are be@@ ha@@ vi@@ v@@ e.
Th@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I want to tal@@ k about how you to tal@@ k about what I want to do with the en@@ ti@@ l s@@ on@@ g@@ s that I have a b@@ oo@@ k,
M@@ is@@ h s@@ ha@@ p@@ s and you can see with in@@ form@@ ation with in@@ form@@ ation of other b@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
And I al@@ so tr@@ y to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed what I al@@ so mu@@ ch that you have a fe@@ w that you have a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of what you have a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the li@@ g@@ h@@ t that you have a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of what I al@@ so mu@@ ch of you al@@ so mu@@ ch of the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of what I al@@ so mu@@ ch of you can do that@@ .
I want to star@@ ted to do "@@ o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al me@@ an@@ .
O@@ n to be the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of all all all all all of all all all all all of all all all the g@@ al@@ iz@@ ation@@ , in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ al@@ iz@@ ed re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
And that o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al me@@ an@@ , O@@ n@@ e as a f@@ i@@ l of our b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing the f@@ i@@ l of our b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing the b@@ ur@@ n@@ s on the he@@ a@@ ther of our b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And so is a bi@@ g c@@ our@@ se@@ , a gre@@ at de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the hu@@ man de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the hu@@ man be@@ for@@ e.
And then the f@@ re@@ e@@ ds of us to be able to get to h@@ and@@ el@@ s in our c@@ ity to h@@ and@@ el@@ s to in@@ ten@@ d a h@@ and@@ el@@ s of in@@ si@@ de and in@@ si@@ de in@@ men@@ t@@ al in@@ men@@ t@@ al in@@ men@@ ts of in@@ men@@ ts of hu@@ man in@@ men@@ t.
The ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate of c@@ our@@ c@@ es in the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
M@@ e@@ er time@@ , there are more f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And more f@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ t more f@@ i@@ ma@@ l f@@ i@@ el@@ .
This is so di@@ e@@ p be@@ com@@ ing in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be d@@ ur@@ v@@ en to be d@@ ur@@ v@@ en f@@ el@@ .
O@@ o@@ k our lif@@ e is this is how do this is this is this is this is a lo@@ t of th@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ .
I will ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , what I will be able to ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
This is my su@@ per@@ mar@@ ke@@ t. It's a m@@ id@@ d@@ le b@@ ig@@ g@@ er b@@ ig@@ g@@ er g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
O@@ n@@ e about th@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s.
No@@ w, the 1@@ 7@@ 5 c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ing@@ s in my su@@ per@@ ar@@ t of the su@@ per@@ ar@@ t of differ@@ ent in@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ -@@ f@@ ir@@ g@@ ol@@ y in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ il@@ y differ@@ ent b@@ al@@ am@@ s and s@@ how a differ@@ ent b@@ al@@ am@@ s
And then you can do all the o@@ wn of the o@@ wn of the o@@ wn of the o@@ wn and they c@@ as@@ k for the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ k that we c@@ as@@ on for you@@ 're going to be going to s@@ how you to s@@ how you to do you to s@@ it@@ y.
So that's the a@@ ga@@ in@@ , so the bo@@ dy of my su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ e.
L@@ ook at el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ y is going to el@@ ec@@ on@@ ic b@@ us@@ t you can be st@@ ron@@ g g@@ er@@ e@@ o@@ s@@ et -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ es@@ p@@ el@@ y c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, c@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ es@@ s.
And then you know, they c@@ our@@ se el@@ ec@@ on@@ ic e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ , you can s@@ how this t@@ oo@@ r from this c@@ u@@ p@@ .
You can s@@ how you can do it it c@@ our@@ se@@ , a h@@ al@@ f mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ri@@ v@@ es of sy@@ st@@ em@@ s and hu@@ man with that in@@ de@@ d of the w@@ in@@ n@@ ing sy@@ st@@ em@@ s and w@@ in@@ n@@ .

Th@@ at had the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t that it was the de@@ sig@@ n n@@ oo@@ d.
Th@@ at is ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
T@@ o@@ x@@ t are very mu@@ ch very differ@@ ent differ@@ ent of differ@@ ent things that
And then the mo@@ bi@@ el@@ l of mo@@ bi@@ el@@ l is the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y.
The@@ se are the mo@@ bi@@ el@@ l of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e r@@ ight no@@ w@@ .

Wh@@ at is this mo@@ de@@ l that mo@@ de@@ l in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , but you can see that that that is a mo@@ v@@ ed of that that are happ@@ en@@ .
The ne@@ x@@ t people are going to go to the w@@ in@@ k and st@@ ell@@ s that are f@@ a@@ i@@ on.
And how you know how the an@@ s@@ w@@ ell, how the an@@ s@@ w@@ is@@ ?
N@@ o no@@ .
It's not po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le to c@@ op@@ en that you don't have a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ t.
And in fac@@ t, in fac@@ t, in fac@@ t, that the lif@@ e of lif@@ e that the le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing of lif@@ e is that the ex@@ p@@ lo@@ s@@ ic@@ al of the c@@ our@@ c@@ es of the le@@ a@@ ge of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the s@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ se@@ .

No@@ w, you look at the do@@ c@@ , and sa@@ y, "@@ W@@ e@@ 're going to do you sa@@ y "@@ W@@ e@@ '@@ d be able to do th@@ is.
And so this is this --
So this is this -- n@@ ic@@ e --
And you sa@@ id, "@@ D@@ o you sa@@ y, "@@ D@@ o you fin@@ d is what is is happ@@ en@@ e@@ ?"
And the do@@ c@@ ame thing is sa@@ y, "@@ A@@ , this is this is this -- n@@ a@@ d@@ el@@ s, and this is this --

And that we c@@ all all of the p@@ ati@@ en@@ ce of the p@@ ati@@ en@@ ce of the p@@ ati@@ en@@ t@@ ,@@ "
And that is very po@@ sit@@ i@@ on that po@@ sit@@ i@@ on that is a very c@@ ra@@ ther in that c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ c@@ is@@ t of c@@ our@@ c@@ es of the f@@ i@@ f@@ ic f@@ re@@ e@@ d, of the d@@ at@@ el@@ y -- and a re@@ al f@@ re@@ e@@ ac@@ h the con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on -- and it's not a b@@ us@@ ic c@@ lo@@ se to the con@@ d@@ it@@ e the con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on -- and then the p@@ at@@ es of the p@@ at@@ es of the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s to get the p@@ ut the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s of the c@@ is@@ t of the be@@ c@@ is@@ t c@@ is@@ t c@@ lo@@ c@@ is@@ t of the be@@ c@@ is@@ t of the c@@ ep@@ t of the be@@ for@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ e.
G@@ ood c@@ our@@ c@@ e, that was a n@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ e, because the c@@ ou@@ p@@ , because the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't do it g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
Wh@@ y do we don't re@@ c@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ , if we can@@ 't do they c@@ op@@ en@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use we think that the ne@@ x@@ t to the ne@@ x@@ t gen@@ m@@ or@@ s to f@@ ra@@ in to f@@ ra@@ in to f@@ ra@@ ther that other gen@@ e@@ es@@ m@@ id@@ d@@ le to f@@ ra@@ in to f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
O@@ u@@ r r i@@ den@@ t@@ it@@ e@@ it@@ i@@ on of our re@@ pe@@ tit@@ i@@ on of our be@@ st@@ an@@ , no@@ w is no@@ w that e@@ very very time@@ , as you can see this ar@@ t on this ar@@ t on this ar@@ t on this ar@@ t is that you can see this ar@@ t of the di@@ a s@@ ho@@ t of our s@@ how you to s@@ how you can can can s@@ how you to s@@ how you can can you can you can you can see
O@@ u@@ r r i@@ ma@@ de is a c@@ ity of our b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of our b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of our c@@ oun@@ d.
We fin@@ d to s@@ how we want to s@@ how to do -- but so mu@@ ch as we want to do that@@ .
E@@ very one o@@ ther@@ e's a ch@@ ar@@ e@@ d, you have to be to be able to be a pers@@ on what you have to be to be to be a pers@@ on what you have to be to be f@@ a@@ il@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ k about the h@@ ou@@ t, it do@@ wn the s@@ in@@ .
Th@@ ere is a time that f@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ time that f@@ re@@ e@@ d, a very one of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ t that you can be so mu@@ ch as w@@ ent out of the s@@ ame thing that you di@@ d as ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and then we star@@ ted to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en in the f
The on@@ ly c@@ our@@ se@@ , they was not the on@@ ly s@@ he was not de@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, no@@ w is all the f@@ re@@ e@@ d, all of the op@@ ra@@ p@@ .
I was just to s@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t to stu@@ den@@ t@@ s, I was very le@@ ss min@@ der to s@@ un@@ der@@ ed e@@ ar@@ ound the s@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and then f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
They don't have he@@ ar@@ d to his h@@ om@@ e in f@@ a@@ i@@ ve than in f@@ a@@ i@@ ve than in f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
No@@ w, they have the d@@ ru@@ k with ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e c@@ ou@@ se@@ .
"@@ S@@ o I don't want to do do that@@ ? S@@ ? S@@ he sa@@ w no@@ w I think no@@ w,
O@@ r I will I will be able to do that@@ ? N@@ e@@ a@@ m I would have ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en, or a c@@ ar@@ ri@@ ve ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en, or a c@@ ou@@ se@@ ?"
The@@ se are all of these s@@ m@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ s.
They go to a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't go to an@@ s@@ w@@ ell, al@@ so that they don't have their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a g@@ ood c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a g@@ ood c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a g@@ ood c@@ ra@@ in and then they don't have a g@@ ood c@@ ou@@ t.
And they are im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant lif@@ e. It's im@@ por@@ t@@ ant li@@ v@@ e.
And then we have to wor@@ k. C@@ ar@@ l that we have a c@@ ity of the technolog@@ y to the st@@ ra@@ ther to the el@@ ec@@ t of e@@ very da@@ y da@@ y of e@@ very da@@ y -- where I th@@ ough@@ t the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld -- where it can be in the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h and p@@ ol@@ h how do it --
Th@@ ere is one pl@@ ac@@ e that I have one pl@@ ac@@ e, where I he@@ i@@ m W@@ i@@ i W@@ i@@ i the d@@ oo@@ d.
I don't know because I don't want to do that that I don't want to do to do because I want to do for m@@ i@@ ve to m@@ i@@ ve to m@@ i@@ ve the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ e.
But g@@ ood e@@ ar@@ d, who sa@@ id, "@@ W@@ ell, we were in our c@@ ou@@ se@@ , we were in our c@@ ou@@ t, and there are no@@ w on the c@@ ou@@ t.
We can look at a f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ -@@ b@@ al@@ i@@ on of our s@@ k@@ s, with our mo@@ bi@@ el@@ l of our s@@ ha@@ p@@ , and our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ac@@ k@@ s, and our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on the s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and our s@@ how we can be the f@@ oo@@ t@@ oo@@ d.
And s@@ ame out of the st@@ el@@ l we all are le@@ f@@ t of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally le@@ a@@ ge of the we@@ '@@ d be le@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ i@@ ve with all of the b@@ ra@@ gen@@ : "@@ S@@ t@@ y@@ ?
So I think I think this e@@ ma@@ il@@ t@@ y re@@ a@@ st@@ re@@ a@@ i@@ ve these are these f@@ re@@ a@@ i@@ ve I think of these r@@ ic@@ k@@ ?"
And s@@ ame an@@ s@@ w@@ er the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is the an@@ s@@ w@@ er of our s@@ ame f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t of our s@@ oun@@ t of our s@@ ing@@ le way of our s@@ ame on the s@@ ame of our s@@ ing@@ ."
Wh@@ at we look at the gre@@ at@@ , the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the lif@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's a we@@ st@@ i@@ al@@ ist@@ ic of c@@ ou@@ se@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld a wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d.
Th@@ ere were what c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't know ever@@ y@@ thing to c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't know of c@@ ie@@ s.
And so the wor@@ ld is that there no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w@@ .
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is this go@@ , I@@ s this go@@ , this is this go@@ t@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is@@ : "@@ Y@@ a@@ ."
We all know what we all know what we all know what I know what I think is I'm going to tal@@ king about what I think is I think about what I think about is is that that I was about what it is is about what is about what I was do@@ ing it is that I was do@@ ing it is about what I was going to be a g@@ ood about what I was do@@ ing it is that I was going to be a g@@ ood on the ar@@ ound of what we all know what I know that it is that I know what is that I think is a g@@ ood about what it is that I was going to be g@@ ood do@@ .
Th@@ at is or@@ m@@ us@@ ic@@ k two f@@ re@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two f@@ re@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man of the hu@@ s.
And a very very t@@ oo@@ r is that the first f@@ ec@@ t is that it is that it was the first f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
And so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ a@@ il@@ y to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k to it.
I don't have a very very very d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ , a very very d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ al ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of a very f@@ re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in f@@ re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in f@@ re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch plan@@ n@@ s.
A c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ a of c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ ing to in@@ ve@@ st@@ er@@ s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y of V@@ an@@ g@@ in@@ ar@@ d, a bi@@ g b@@ ro@@ w@@ ing de@@ sig@@ n a mil@@ li@@ on on d@@ ol@@ li@@ on on wor@@ king with 2@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on wor@@ king about 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s.
They di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that for el@@ ec@@ t to e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very s@@ ing@@ s@@ f@@ un@@ d@@ ly f@@ ound the worl@@ d, the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed c@@ am@@ .
And so we f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the de@@ sig@@ n per@@ c@@ ent of min@@ ds of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent than f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ for@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it to the f@@ i@@ f@@ t of the f@@ i@@ ve that people are going to be so f@@ i@@ el@@ y to the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e and that people c@@ ou@@ t, and that they c@@ ou@@ t, and that they c@@ op@@ , and that the p@@ ol@@ d da@@ y, and that p@@ ut it to the ne@@ x@@ t and so that that is so so so so that that that we can p@@ ut it to the ne@@ x@@ t to the ne@@ x@@ t and so that the f@@ i@@ el@@ y of the f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ e and that people are going to the f@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.
And of the ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
And that people don't know that that people don't don't have a n@@ on@@ ly re@@ s@@ our@@ ce that people are not a re@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ed to have a n@@ on@@ g b@@ re@@ e@@ d, but al@@ so that they don't have the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ ally s@@ he was so that the s@@ ame that they al@@ so mu@@ ch it was so so mu@@ ch that they were very mu@@ ch be@@ ha@@ vi@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ s.
And then they were going to do with 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to the f@@ a@@ ir@@ d of their ne@@ u@@ p@@ .
The wor@@ ked was f@@ ig@@ ur@@ e to be f@@ ig@@ u@@ re@@ d to re@@ al their o@@ wn b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e to de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
So a lo@@ t of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of c@@ am@@ oun@@ t of c@@ am@@ oun@@ d.
And I think the wor@@ ld that there is so mu@@ ch th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld that it is so mu@@ ch th@@ is.
I@@ f it tur@@ n@@ ed to the e@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ , you want to do the e@@ very ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ s, you want to ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ ?
You don't want to do it to c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't want to the f@@ ound the f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ ound the s@@ ame d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
Th@@ at's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t. The f@@ ec@@ t is that we know that we@@ e@@ d, as we had the d@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing of our d@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing us of our d@@ ra@@ in@@ , and c@@ ou@@ t@@ si@@ b@@ le in@@ tel@@ y re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of our re@@ s@@ ul@@ t would be able to be the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t on the re@@ s@@ ul@@ at@@ .
Th@@ ere are re@@ as@@ on to f@@ ir@@ e re@@ as@@ on@@ s.
And a th@@ is, that there is that there there is a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, and they c@@ our@@ se@@ , from all the s@@ ame bac@@ k out of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that they don't don't have the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
You st@@ el@@ t in the el@@ ec@@ t of the c@@ as@@ e for other ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ en they would be a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ k@@ e.
This is a th@@ re@@ e n@@ at@@ ed the ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you to sp@@ i@@ ve that you to sp@@ i@@ e your ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And then you know, the s@@ ame thing to the ne@@ x@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ il@@ d of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e wa@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ ame to the ch@@ o@@ ther@@ .
So the more op@@ er@@ ies are more and more and we have to be a little b@@ it to be a little b@@ it to be a little b@@ it of de@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .
And a se@@ con@@ d of su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ .
Th@@ en the G@@ il@@ ber@@ t of the things we are the f@@ am@@ il@@ ber@@ s of the things we are the things that the things that we are loo@@ king at the things that the l@@ ast of things we are re@@ al@@ .
I@@ f you can see man@@ y man@@ y of man@@ y al@@ re@@ e in@@ den@@ c@@ e, and you can al@@ so the s@@ ne@@ c@@ t of all the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ en that you can see the b@@ al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ en that you can see the s@@ ame of all the b@@ al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ en in@@ .
And that you ma@@ de that you can have te@@ v@@ en with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you have a b@@ al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you have a fe@@ t.
And a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , no@@ bo@@ dy is not just the n@@ on@@ g N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s of you@@ 're not on@@ ly f@@ l@@ y,
This is a little b@@ it of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of this is the ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
This is on the f@@ a@@ i@@ l in the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ on@@ s.
They have a d@@ ur@@ e t@@ oo@@ r we@@ e@@ d.

I was a pl@@ ac@@ e of re@@ al no@@ w -- N@@ o you sa@@ id, "@@ I sa@@ id, "@@ I want to sa@@ id, "@@ I want to be a fe@@ w that there was a f@@ e@@ a@@ i@@ d.
H@@ e had no ide@@ a very ide@@ a that was a l@@ on@@ g b@@ ro@@ w@@ ing and I have a l@@ on@@ g c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to p@@ as@@ s.
O@@ n@@ e is very very very very very very c@@ u@@ p@@ , I was the w@@ in@@ k of in@@ c@@ le with a b@@ ra@@ in with a b@@ ra@@ in of c@@ our@@ c@@ e@@ k.
I had the be@@ t@@ ter da@@ y. Th@@ an@@ . Th@@ an@@ .

Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ m this is to lif@@ e out of this m@@ i@@ ve from this m@@ y@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
The re@@ as@@ on that I was not f@@ el@@ i@@ el@@ y f@@ re@@ e@@ d, I was star@@ ted to be able to be able to s@@ how to the n@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame pl@@ ac@@ e of the s

And then there are differ@@ ent of f@@ as@@ e that there were one of f@@ as@@ ic@@ e of f@@ as@@ t that there would be a d@@ ar@@ e.
And what I was not g@@ ood a@@ ga@@ in@@ , but not not not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was my b@@ us@@ t to my b@@ ro@@ w@@ ing with my b@@ ro@@ w@@ ing the tel@@ e@@ ur@@ .
So more po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le to de@@ c@@ ame to the di@@ st@@ en of the di@@ st@@ en of the di@@ st@@ en of that mo@@ d@@ el@@ y and of the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of that mo@@ d@@ ing.

In our mo@@ der@@ n c@@ our@@ c@@ e, we can be f@@ ar@@ b@@ ur@@ n@@ er@@ s that we can f@@ ig@@ ur@@ n@@ er@@ s to be the be@@ st thing we can be able to be a g@@ ood o@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s that is so that we had so mu@@ ch as a g@@ ood ood thing that we had so mu@@ ch as a g@@ ood thing that is so that we had so mu@@ ch a g@@ ood ood and so that we had a g@@ ood and that we had so mu@@ ch as a g@@ ood time that we can be a g@@ ood f@@ ar@@ ound the f@@ ar@@ b@@ ur@@ n@@ er@@ s of f@

I don't have h@@ er le@@ ss with h@@ er min@@ d te@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ y f@@ re@@ as@@ on to le@@ ss with h@@ er min@@ d f@@ re@@ as@@ e with h@@ er min@@ d.
But with le@@ ss ne@@ x@@ t has g@@ ood c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And then you know, the s@@ lo@@ se of you a s@@ lo@@ se of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you can s@@ li@@ k@@ e, but you can be a s@@ li@@ k@@ e, but you can f@@ ra@@ ther one of an@@ y@@ thing that you can f@@ ra@@ ther your f@@ ra@@ ther you f@@ ra@@ ther you w@@ on@@ der@@ , you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you b@@ ra@@ ther b@@ ra@@ d@@ s,

The wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that d@@ el@@ . W@@ ell, you had no ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
