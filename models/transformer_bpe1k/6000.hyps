And I was a year I was this two dia's two dia's pools that the pools of the last three million years of the fairly million years of the faster of the vaster of the S, with 40 percent crops crops of the figures.
But this is a probably the real problem because it's not the anific problem because it's not the diction of the animagine.
The secure on the North pool is in the click is in the clopped of our global system.
It looks like the winter and cript in the sone.
The next dia that I law is a version of what the last 25 years is a very bird of what happened in 25 is happened in 25 is a very bread.
The permanences is induce in rood.
And if you look at the same through it from the dark barker law.
That is the years, it's the early either the winter.
And it cript in the song.
And the one of called the permanence or five years older, is almost like blood, that from the body is that from the body is here.
In 25 years is the of this is the count of this gar.
And that's a problem because the virond North Isque Issea and the North Issea very great high obvious a very great high fools figure or fiely figure is figure in medict mediating the vironmental regultly.
And the totale with the totale of the totale of the atmosphere, which would be clear to be indubulness and if we can put it and if we can clearning the engineers.

Whoo! Well, it's OK. The question is whether we will be whether we will be whether we will be wrong or whether we will be whether we will be be whether we will be well.
A reason is that this enormous said "warms Groenland from the normous were from the normous were country to head.
This is a smely smelerriver.
The water is every greater than ever being beye than ever beying.
This is the Kanglusual suast-Groengineer.

In the Anded, this glast the bron of three water for this city.
There are more stromes.
But when they walk them down, and then it is also drowater.
In California was a story of 40 percent in the sneuwspack of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservice.
And as you could be couldn't experiences are the countries.
These world's world three dregully, we have a dramatical stimagination.
And the number of natural is about the whole world is incredible and never seen with a understanding and ity.
And there are more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the last 75 years.
This patterns is very involved increating incredid.
If you look at the picture of a historice context than you can see what happening.
In the last year we have 70 million ton on CO2 million ton on the every 24 hours --
25 miles ton every day in our ocean, Koogo, Koot, Kood, and regular acean, from America, west, from America, west, and every day and every day of the Indian int, there is a radge of the soceurnitians of the ocean.
The only groups are expension of the Earth, which is the burning for 20 percent of the phospire of fossil brans of phossil brance.
One is a problem and cool is the all of the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the two biggest of China.
And there was a lot of more still more still cool.
But we see a memultimy.
These are the cition of the bold of the bold of the bold in the last ast years, and where groups groups were greengineered in the last alternations of the last encountralternations of the biginess of the bilities of the last years.
There is a political stripe in our country.
The stence, and oils and oils industire gave a year---dollars of dollars of a dollars of a bigness of promots, what a testststice is a truth.
And that picture to something about something about something about something about that.

Thank you very much.
And I am a year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I am to come back with a update about how machine machine the machine works.
So here's now, I am not depene: the LHe is the most scientific experiment in science of the scienment of ever ever in the miles in ever in the miles in ever in education.
It need to be the stances that are never seen between a billion done billion dless second to the universe to fix,
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine Geneed.
We need photographs of the mini-Bangs in detectors in detectors I was a mease that I was called the ATLATATATATATLATATATLATATAs -- 44 meter.
Spectacular phophotographphosics in the scale that you can see the scale that you can see the scale that you can see the scale your scale that you can see the scale that you can see the scale that you can see the scale of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA
And in 10 september shape for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for 10 september of the machine for the machine for 10 september for the machine for 10 sep.
This picture was foff, by ATLAS.
That is a fact in the controlling in the controlly.
It's a picture of the first particular particularly the LHut, and with the LHe girls with a stuff, with a piece of the LHCC, which is a piece in the dector of the tector of the first ctor of the first thing in the ctor of the first thing in the first piece of the first picture of the first thing that is a picture of the first picture of the first picture of the first picture of the first particticular of the first thing that
In other words, when we saw that picture that picture we saw the machine that the machine works, what a huge works, what a huge is a huge win.
I don't know if this the biggest rightest crence, or done or done or done and somebody went to Google and saw the internetpage.
And that means we made a cultural as a scientific impact impact that we made a scientifice impact that means made a science.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what had had to make a problem with this gold wouldn't draw.
And that draws ago, 13 thousands of thousands the machine on follows on ful.
The engineers increating you say, "Niet it true. It is a little draw."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superature lawn.
So on might between the mimages than the space between the girls that wirrite between the reasons.
In a of the next of the next of the next of thousands in the LHC, set a construction.
And then through the wirelectrical wear, and there was a little bit of each that 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of the regond.
This was the resultyes.
This is still indrugs you can realized that magnets more than 20 ton agnets more than 20 times and they were about 30 percenters in 30 times of the time.
We went to save 50 magnets.
We most, and they had to device out what we did dep.
We all have a lot of course.
Now they're back on weed.
Eind might now the LHC weer intact is going to be intact.
We will be able to say him and we expect to measured to you, and so we can be able to be able to the bigh of the bigh of the universes of the universes of the universum of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who are unhappiness to the debate of science, the value of science. It is making.
I think it's so much that it is so hard to be a few that we government is that the value of things like the value of things like the same this.
I love the last words of the English science, said the last of Davy, distance, again, in the defiely of the values of his learning experiments of his learning was so figure of the human said, "No o o said, "No said, "No of the faster of the human being of the scovered in the mimay of the last company of the compley of the company of the nature of the company of the last ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast company of the lassiony Davitionatatatatatatatatatatature of the last ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast
Thank you very much!
I would want to start with you to ask with you, and I want to go to your children you go to your children you with block fly.
And then you designed how you get to understand how you put it and wood, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you were going to losing the engineering and the early increations of space.
Rutell invision is ststancce, because with the world to understand us.
If a information, as a name of physical interaction of physical interaction with my advision -- samps with my advision and my advision of Kalanithi -- I started to ask me -- what we started to a computer of a computer of musical fissue as a completely of musical fious as a lowing fulling a little bit with a lowing ficious of a fious of a frontificully, and a st, and a gy-building a little bjects of a lot of fical fickes of a mitious of fissue of fist of fish oilitical fical fultions of fultions of fultions of fulland-builities of the fult of fical fultions of it
and can we want to lene?
This is question that we asked us so we field, that we cught a answer of Siftables.
Cort Kort is a Siftly a Sifle computer grandmovement in a cooky of a cook.
They can be able to the hand they can be each other, they can put a movement and they can put a screen and they were a scream and contact.
The certainly start is the physical hands can be clock to to understand to understand by the fix.
Bovenue are Siftables a new ecosystem for the way, for the manipulate of the manipularly information.
And that this hold middle of a physical difference, and each of their movement and even of their momovement and even of the way we have to be different ent to each them different new new and each new and we have new new and designed to designed to design.
I started to start with some simply example example of animage examples
This Sifty is instimaginstimagins, which is to true a fours and others and others and others and others and others and others and other.
These interactive portratrains are each other.
Indience of each other, they will be increated for each other.
And if they can be a realize and they can be what they can be a little bit and what they can be being and what it could be being thing.
And then they felt and they went and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction, it used to the usincreating of a little bit of a little bit of a foot of a small of a foot of a food.
In this example Siftables of Siftables for and I can use them to use them and I can use them to a little bit in a legning too.
If we went to reven, we went what back.
There are some of course, there are some of the education, for the educational play spelles, and logician, and logics and logics and logics to try and the reachulate things to probers, and the reachult of the result of course.
So here is the same thing I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci reprogram by a simplice.
And here we crabble that a cruist Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in anybody around a leads to get on every Siftable, and case Siftable, and case controllly.
Now, about 30 seconds of the condition is very reminds a new series of new series of a new series of the bion of the bical moimagins.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the clated, and I am from a four.
They were working on a very very well.
And one of the most interesting things of these things of these things that people need is that people need to have a instructions need.
All you have to say "My word" and they know what they have to do do do do do do do do do what they need to do do do do do do you do.
Here are some other people to the other people on the test.
That's our youngst bain, researing resource.
And it looks like Siftables that he stappullables in the Siftables
For him were this bad cles.
And here is a interactive pildry to be a interactive.
We wanted to be a platform for the last of tal develop.
This is Felix that demonstreatts.
He can carakters in the scene in the scengine, by the Siftable to the Siftable.
Here he law the song.
Video: The search.
David Merrill: No has a tractor in the scene in the scare.
Video: The orange tractor.
God day! Yeah!
And in Siftables and the name pure can places the cools can places the carakters let reags with each other.
DM: That M: That's own story story
Video: Hallo!
DM: It is a story with a story with a story with a story
and he decision how it decisid.
Video: The cool.
DM: The last example I will tone, I will tell Is a synthesizer and live music, where we have recent to developed that we have a happiness that we have a happy product to the lead, based and based the lead, and based the based of based that I went to the lead, and the legs of the legal Sificious that I
Eeniations has been a fiars, where you can make you can use your may be able to use your may use you want to use that.
They're happened in Siftables in Siftables are inject that you can be increated to palize the palize that you can palize it paliftables in the paliftables in Siftables in leave and paliftables in a paliftables in legning Siftftables in leave you can be inject
You place a happy in the patterns in the patterns of a lege Siftable to controllerble of a legs of a legs and filter.
They are being a money and including to change and any by a little bit of count of a sound to change and and and incluence.
And found the algood as the algood as the patternition that are being pattern.
Let's look at a look at every simultil
Video: DM: We're start with a lead in two Siftables, to a first patroclearned by a extra flengy by a extra
Now I think the basicline that I was a basicline that I was the basic.
Video: No you foot what I was a little bit work on the work work
Video: And I copple I came the filter I could put the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can call the powers of the change of the change of the change block you.
Video: No you copple I cum the filter for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reresources to represent it in the speair.
So I don't have any to plann, but I can provisures, but I can improvisers, it being a very longer and before I want.
And so, you know, the dimmmmespecially Siftable to have the fully.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of the making of new people, and the new people, that are better interfaces that are better including to the brains and body working on the brains and working and working on the brains of the brains of the brains of the brains that are communits to the way to the way to the way to the way to the bra
And I had a little bit of time to a new either in this designed in this designed with some of a single movice that we have the developing of the lable.
The thought I want to talk about this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that I want to a very new generation with a new generation of the interact with digital media, who we wanted the information of the world as we wanted to our world as we wanted to our world as we wanted to our breagull.
I thank you very much of harted.
I look at you look at you to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to to to you all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I again.
I'm write write am write am write am writy.
Books my work, is my work, but also much more than that.
My lives live live and I am and I think that ever will change and I think that ever will change to change that.
And then there is a very unlight in my relations and career in my relationship, which I had my relationship with my relationship with my relationship.
And the began to a book that I have a mean, a memove, a memoire: "Ets, Bidds, Bidds, Bembiness to my first one work about the entire work about the whole work about the whole work about the whole world work about the whole world work about a book.
The equently that people are always to all the time, and always I have to be a bread.
Well, you know, what -- you know, you know,
People are coming to me and ask me and ask you and ask you that you don't never that you can never be that success to be a success of event?
And you don't know that you can see that you have to be live to be a book more a book of a book of a book where people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be lopen?
And you don't have a lot of the bang of the bang of the bang of the bang of it.
Every girl, you know, you know.
Now, curly, that would be very remember I remember I was a told -- I was a told that I was told that I was a told that I wanted to be a told to be a told to be a told to be a told that I was a told to be a told that I was a told that I was a told that I meme.
People said, "Ben you don't never bang that you never get success that you get never get never s?
You don't you know, you know, for education, that you can do you experience?
And you don't know that you can be life to this work on this work on that there are ever ever to be something that you can be able to the putting and that you can do with your brown brow with your broa?"
Everything in that streking.
In the cors is my answered on that questions on that question neer: "Yeah.
Yeah, I'm very bang for all these things that gentle.
Always alway.
But I am for a lot of other things that you don't know that all of all of all things that we all all of it.
For seeing very example, and other engineering things.
But what company write I ask to the last time I mean, the last time that anglast time that anglast found.
Is it rational it rational that?
Is it logically somebody is somebody to be a bang for the work for the work for their people?
What is so so so that we creative processes that we are our squickly to make the effects of the girls of the girls of the species of work on the species of work on the species.
Now, you know, my father. He was wrote engineering that there was not remember that there was not in the 40 years that he was working on the ever remember or he was going to be a or he didn't be a bance.
So from "Yohn, how is the chememblockay?"
Now, so was not about it.
And for a fair, woo: scree eught by the euws not the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of manages that is not the reputation of the euil.
Scheases that we have a kind of reputation.
Not just just just a write creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of instability.
Look at the grimic doty dotal creative the most magnifical creative euw.
And then stile young, fail, fail.
And even though the same moord not even understand used their gave swell.
In the last interview for his done for his done of my books is a stuff, "Met ely of my books is a stuff."
That's going to say about what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of this kind of course, we don't look at it.
We all have the first thing that we heard and have the saround and have accepted and have accepted to all the sky.
The head, the basically is that creativity is that creativity, and that a list of lics and that a artists and that is going to be ineventually intend to resources to infiely to resources to real equip.
That's why I want to ask everybody here to ask with that idea of life lives to you with that idea of life life liv?
Do you have you that OK?
Now, I think about it is a good about nadence I think it doesn't find the pretty day.
I find it to find it again,
And also another dangerous ever ever ever ever another dangerous.
I didn't see that this eum that this eum so glow it do.
We can creative a lot of better mimages to life.
I know that it would say that it would be able to me for me, in my situation, business to be a bark to the dark life.
Seker the phase value in my career value in my cared.
Ga but I am am am am am safy you.
I can be able to be a four decennia decade,
And this is going to be a little bit is going to be a publish the expenside that was shows that was a follower on that book.
We're here with friends on each other, so I can get you to get it to the lath my grandands my grandands my grandands of the biggest success of the biggest success.
Jigin, what a idea!
If you think about that, you can see it for you to do it for you to the drive eye to the drive on the drive on the drive of the drive of the drive you to the drive you to the pure of the dridge.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love me with the work of that I think I love to the work where I love to the work of the work of the work of that I love me with the work where I love me I love me with the work of that.
The question is: "Hoo?"
Now, long after I am to the conclusion that I can come by a psychological protect of a psychological scree in the process inside the process inside the process in the process of inbits in the process of infectly being and I think that I think that I have all a psychological scribe a psychological prof

I have the last year in ways to manize that to do that.
I'm going to have a privied and have a dept of any and have a different depicians or other way to see a better way to create a better way to make a with the emotional complicative people with the emotional process of the complicative perpercent process.
My say to the old Gried Gries, and Romein.
Let let it is a long and and increated story.
In the time, in the old Gries, and Romeins not creativity.
Men believed that creativity is a good reason a good reasononsis, which was a bigned to the human and unknowledge and unknow.
The Gries, the Gries, this beautiful, "demoneny "demonence."
Ook Socrates believed that he was a demion that he had a demid.
The Romeins had a species, a species.
And then it called it called a "genidentive, a "genideny a "genideny genidence.
The grapenics is that the Romeins is not a geniics of pure person on on on a pictures.
In their produced was a geniice magical entities that is a genious in the mure of the ately of the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobbby the house.
If the artists of the work of the entire assistence.
And it was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's precision that I first talked about the first about had, the psychological scree of your work.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work in his work.
The artists was so much in screen to protect a lot of narcism.
If you work with a little bit of the early eagain.
And everybody is a wnamely that a understand that a understand that a lot of hold you.
Well, you know, you know, it work on you.
Everybody is that you have a wonderful,
Lange time, that I was a how in the Wests creativity was being profilled.
And then the Renaissance, and everything about it.
There is a very new idea: the individual people, the individual people's the middle of the universes and mysterious and mysterimagics.
No o space for mystical weases of the global world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity is fully fully follow.
And for the first thing in the history of the history of artists say that they were not a genion that they were not a genion that they were not a genion that they had a genion that she was a genion that they were not a genion that she was a genion that she was a genion that they were not a genion that she was a genion that she was a genion that they were not have a genion the first geniical force.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a great figure I think that I think I think that I think a great that I think a great that I have to say that I have to find.
And so one person is one person, one one one one one one one person is a lot of the eule is the count of the eught of the euwrite of the euwrite mystery of all good and the eught of a human psystems for a lot of human psychare.
or you somebody ask somebody question in the slike.
Egos are being early being proportical proportunity and inctions and inctions and expected to prestations of prestations and pimages
And I think this druk the last 500 years ago, many artists has made made a lot of capot of the last 500 years.
And if that is, and I think that is the question is the question?"
Can we do?
Coment, we understand on a older of the relationship of the relationship and the creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Well, we can have 500 years rational humanism not undone not undred in a 18 minutes of minutes
Well, probably in the audience people who have the audiency scientific developing the idea that eial science of the face of the face of the factory of the work of the work of artists of the work of the burning of the cure of the cure of inspirircle of the publist of the publissues of the factors of the mif
It seems that I don't all you all meed.
And I ask it to the me question.
Why don't why don't do that?
Why would we didn't have thought that though?
It is just so much like all the other other story of the other other pass of the total makes that are making incitible of the creative process in the creative process.
Everybody who has a little bit has try to create a little bit -- so in all the count of the number of courses -- not always that it is not always didn't always a little dregularly dregular again.
And that sometimes the some paranormamade a paranormade a paranormade
I have unclose the wish American discchines Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone discovered Stone discovered Stone discovered Stone discovered Stone lonononononountry to design.
They is animagined in the negentitil life lives lives in the next of them.
They tell me about her young the plates of Virginia.
Sometime, if they were fiield, they felt a felt of the same pound.
It was, like said it was so said a great golf a great golf ly.
And it country to the country than the country to her it.
They feel that the ground understand her foot that the same foot that her on that moment that moment to do that, but one one thing to do for her life.
They went to hind by the close and they had to she had to be a squickly, and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper packs.
When it was diverse, the close of her her her her waves to the same thing that her to write the on to write the sky.
Sometimes it was not she didn't have a sick enough
And then walk and right and right, it's not a house.
And in the sult of schools schools and distance, a about the many words on the many words -- in her words -- in her words --
And I think it was a little bit -- this is -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are almost most of the story -- that they almost most most most most mist.
And then then it was in search and paper and paper and paper the count of her hear.
Juist on that moment she had a poty to pack a poty
And with her other hand, so tell me she saw me she close it close it close of the air.
They picture it in his stand, and then then the pure in her body in her body back to them.
In those case came mal it mazing close in sary very much in case of papier, but then in the ful.
When I thought, I thought, what I thought -- what I was so walk my creative process of my creative process
So my creative process is not my creative process is not medium! I am not medium! I am not medium! I am not working my creative process of medium."
I'm a music, who day day day on the same time, and then the same time, and then walk with blood and trans and trans and trans and trans a bigger stelt.
But even in that day I have a wools I have a little bit of a little bit of equared.
You will be able to be a broad, that there are creative ideas that there are creative ideas that you can be inyour inclun that you can see including a bron that you can be able to be increative.
What is that then for burn?
How can we use it usion that we have a healthy that we have this being is that?
At a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine that I can think I think I think I can think I think I think I can put it in the Waits.
A couple of years ago, I was a couple for a time.
We had the hidge here.
And in fact, in fact, a bigh part of his life is a great the toon-wish easy of the magins that expect of all the magins that may creative inctive inctives in him including him in him him in him heavice.
And so the you, the you'll have what rust.
And at a day he went in Los Angeles about the snelwe'd changed the process of the process process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the sneled.
And as he was so red, he was so red, he he was a fragmental melodie.
The decideided like inspiration that weaker does down, and certainly cluded to understand ced.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to the fasth.
But that's not not not going to be it.
He had no papiers, not police, no table, not a table.
The may nam is nam of the muscertain the muscle of him "I am the miful, and then it eying.
I'm not good enough I can't good enough it does."
He didn't real in pany people, but he stoped that help and did something that are going to be something news.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Sorry hands you don't see that I don't see that I don't see that I put it does?"
"Denk you that I really really want to say a lot of a lot of write that I really really think I really think I can really do a lot of a lot of a lot of swrit?
And if you want to really want to have a lot of you have to later another I have to be a later for you to have a weak for you.
So not, you know, somebody anybody can fall.
Ga neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment to love the process of the process of the process of difference of difference.
The work is still is still the sker dark of dark is a dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the same thing.
But the sware spantly that creative process in him close in him close of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the gene.
It was close to the close and learned all of the country and learned all of it.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to gone by gar.
It could be a wonderful, bizare, bizary working a kind of conversation tuses and the own of Tom and the own of Tom and it was not not entire one of Tom and came to be a wonderful of Tom and couldn't work a wonderful of Tom
That story has changed my way of working my way of working change.
I've been a profired of the head.
I was going to show in the write of Ets, Biddle in the counds.
And I found a given moment in a hope.
You know, you can work that that makes not good and you think it it a differences and you think it is a difference. It learn.
Not it looked at a lot of difference, really really really really really really really singly being a lot of difference.
I wanted to do it whole the whole project all the whole project all the whole project all the whole project all the whole project
And then I remember Tom who was a decided to the ends, and I decided a of a power to a power to a power to a power to a power to be a power to his geny and I decided to remember to be a power to be
I wish of my manuscript and I wist and ridge to a lege of the camer.
And I said heart said, "Lister does we know that if this book is not just that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop what I have I have in a me.
Meer I can't count to cle.
And if you have to find that it is you've got to you, you're going to do you your your edge and do.
Snap you? Do you don't you, you're not, you're not, you.
I write door, because that's just my work.
O, and in the notuls are very much more immeans that is just a different different different differences are differen."
Tja--- Unity, the comes on here on neerds it here,
Euws ago, there was a North African wish people in the North African woom of people to danlight to dance.
And Urriting and win, to the ocheed,
That was always well, because the dansers were professionals.
But somevery every every echer something happened something like this.
One of those dance, then then transcendence in the transcendence of the thance of that dance.
You know what I know what I know what I know what I mean, you know, you have ever shows in a performer.
It was like the time the time the times and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He didn't anything about thousands of thousands of thousands all of it.

That's hard like that.
That's working to be a very hard to a creative a creative increative in.
But so put it doesn't be a prive.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have the equickly about a few of this projects, about the human genome and what that can means and what that can means and the descarned of gene.
We started to start a new punt: we were the digital code the digitalized to the digital code of the digital code to a new of the next of the base of the bure of life in the vire of life.
So we trying to ask the great questions to ask the great questions.
"What is liv?" I think that I think about what many biologists have trying to understand to understand on different nive.
We have different bences protect protect to leave to minimal components.
We are the digitalmost 20 years on the digitalization.
And then we have the human genome have sequenced, went from the analoge world, wwent from the digital world,
Now, we try to ask life, we can try life to life life or we can create new life and regenerate?
This is the map of a little organism of a little organism. Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smaller genome in a labory of a laboratorious in a laboratorium.
And we try to look at a nice or we can get a nice smaller genome.
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so there.
But if we look at the metabolical cools is relative relative with the in.
Gely me, this is simply simply it.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at a very unliving that this is a living that this would be a living a living cell cell living a living of count of the genes that we could be cel list.
We decided that the only rout, why the only rout, this chromosing this chromosing synthetions and so we count the components and to make the most of the most fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fune of the most wom.
And so we started to ask with questions are we started a chromos?"
Stake the chemists the chemists that very great moleculen we never have never seen before we never seen e?
End, if we can do that, a chromosopped to star?
A chromosly is tried to a piece is a piece material material material inate.
So, us to the digitalizes of life is life is life is on exponential education.
Our moves to produced the genetic code to lower the genetic code but is weam in the genome.
And our last point would be the last ponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago, and we started to start
And there were a number of close for a bio-ethic taccountry to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesile.
There are tiends of months of machines in the world that small DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in lengineers, and it's a generation, so you can make it piece the more piece of the world that you have a little bit of it.
So we had to move a new method making for the society of these little pieces and the corn of all the corn of all the corn of all the corn of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi 174.
That's a little four small virus that bacteria doods.
We designed the pieces, they did the fold --
and had a DNA-molecule of ingetting about 5,000 letters.
The spanases started a little piece of piece, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and firal particulls and firls and firls and fires of gultions and fires and fixed.
The viral particles were cells, they were cells, they were came from the cells, they came back and dood-dood-dood-dregs.
I was include with the oly of the olician, and I said that they said that model that model that model to good with the oil.
They laught more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation in the software are own bile of a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much big a lot of big ters.
We wanted to full the follow.
That is more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we build to build them in cassetts, so that we build the cassetts.
and to understand what the done of the edge components of a live.
The designers is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that you have to be accuraft accures accuraft accures are accrote accuraft with digital information in the computer than you have to be start with digital information information in the computer than any information information in the digital information information inform
And then we first first first this genome sament, in 1995 was a standard of the standard of a figure 10,000 baseparts.
And finally, we found after 30 found 30 founds. If we had the original sequence had not used to be able to start in the city.
One part of the designed is the designed of stuff, that 50 letters are the designed to all the other stuffs of 50 letters to build so that we have to build so that we need to build so that they can designed to designed so that they can be able to be able to design the designed to build to built that we have to be able to be able to built to be de
We designed here uniquickly.
Maybe you have money that we are water water in stopped in stop.
Beause th: we have a four, a four, A, C, A, C, and T.
Trios of those letters coders for cruws -- that there is a sible of a sible of clearning for each ozuugh.
So we can use the genetic code to be word to write write in the myself.
And, we have to be a mip.
Some were called that there were not a lot of any that there were not have a lot of anything.
We have this stuck that we can designed them can be able to each them with enzymes.
There are enzyms that they repart and in each other.
And we started to start with stuff, to start with stuff, who were five to 7,000 letters that were pieces that were pieces to each other, then then then then then then then then then then then to 70,000 letter, to 70,000 letters to 700,000 letters that five five to 70,000 letters that five to 7,000 legs that five to 7,000
In each count of course we want to be a sure of these stuck so we could couldn't want to be a process of a process that is very roble -- that is going to be very robubuilt you.
We try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
So this is from a basketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbaketbaketbal.
And so, we have a lot of the bigned to pieces -- more than 10,000 bases -- then they don't make more than 10,000 bainess in E.
And that is the explose of all the modern of the modern of the molecular biology.
And why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination, that is used by the biology to the biology to repart of DNA bA biness and samps can food.
Here's a example of it.
There is a organism gentled Deinocct that three million durans that three million to stred to can.
And that you see in the boventest paneel, right now, cromosly just clearning out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later later it was a weather, prected the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands this around thousands of organisms that this around this art.
They're organisms can popposed to be regully.
They can live.
I know that there can be able to be life in the space can put in the space can provided a new again, a new aquatissue.
NASA has transshot that there's many of there, there's a lot of there.
Here's a is a lot of the molecule micropphicrope that we made with this processes -- all gist-mechanisms with the right mechanisms of the right design mechanisms of the stuff.
Gake it may be that they are along that automatish.
This is not eectronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscope.
It's like a big molecule that we can see the with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomen about a period of sourseconds.
This is the publissue we expensions.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule molecule of people, with a people, with a clearning structure.
The moleculeculecule.
And if we would be the same throw with a 10-points letter, letter, then there is 142 pagina's broa's close to the genetic code ages of the air.
Good, how we started a chromos? How do we actives it hi?
And so a virus is the clearned every make.
With a terterion is a lot of increating a lot of increate.
It's also simpler if you put you very simpler ineukyots, like that, you just just just the celery of you and doing a little bit as a little bit as the celertain.
And in the bacteriimages is the chromosopped in the cel, but we have including a full transpling a full transpling of a chromosly exciting a cell of a cell of a cular cell of a cular active.
We have a chromosly soom of a micromosly species.
These are about each others and education, as people and mouth.
We foot what extra genes of extra that we could be so we found this chromosly count of ecters.
We have the true of enzyms to make all the early stuff.
It was write of a cell put this in the cell -- and you will be the very stoped graphphical images -- and it was a very quickly fromosopped in the cel.
We thought it would be that but we would be trying to be trying to developing what it would be able to developing out of the develop.
This is a essentially evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolution.
We discovered all sorts of of that kind of a second chromosopgenomes or a thousands of a thousands of the thousands of the sands of the species in one times of the species of the species of the species.
People who are evolution evolution to anything that are not a lot of biology meevolution to be a lot of biology meed.
There are enzyms that restrictions are enzyms are ences that working DNA A restristriction.
The chromosly that in the cell was not ed.
The cell -- it was a cell -- well, you know, you know, again,
It was the other chromosing, and it regully, and it regularly as a fred material, and it it it every excision to the cell of the cely with the new chromosm.
He was blaw the genes we had the genes we had been been crite in the genes we had stop.
And in very cort time, and all the cort of the carakteristic of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of of the new kind of the new kind of of of the new software in the cill we had been been been been been put in the celect of the course.
All all of the member changes, the member of changes -- when we had the genetic code the genetic codes in the coundation.
This may be a clinically as genomicial. And we are in the class of the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things to change.
Good, I have all the first thing that this is not a produced that this is not -- this is not a wrong fold years ago, and I have a new billion years awed that we have a new bile that maybe we have a new new new scare, where we may species, where we maybe a kind of the kind of bignergs of the based on this kind of course, and I working on this designal design that this is not have a may bety being of the world.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's fairly the fairly if you look at what you needs to what is is no.
We go to the inside of sour-on-half billion people,
Om it in my context place, I am in 1946.
There are three people on this planeets.
and each of us that legs in 1940 years in 1940 years will be that there are four four four years.
We have to moved with food, with the food, medicine, medicine, medicine for the ses-half of the ses-half billion of the sessary.
And that is a last, that is to do.
We use 50 billion count of colly, more than 30 billion fious.
That's 100 milos fiper day.
When we have biological process, or whether or whether or whether to be a huge process to be a huge that is a huge exciting that is a huge excition.
Then of course, of course, there are all that cools in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really come.
That all all of our world's designed a database with a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like the designed for the future of the future of the future.
The eectronics had a doing components, and you can do a doing components, and look at the diversity that is from there.
We are except by a biological reality and our explobal reality.
We have now thank you very much, she called the combined to called "combination-genomics"
We have the possibility to build a great build a millight of a day day can make a day day to make a great day.
If you working about the 20 million different genes of different genes or produced processes to make a soctates or to make a little medicins, we can produced with a little team with a little team of a little team with a little team of scienculary biology biology bile of sciencular sciencularly in the science.
And it's just just standard a but standary of ection.
We can selecters for life for life, and for life, fraise or burning production, faccinproduction, so so so much of enginproduction, so so so much of life.
This is a scree of what emaping every eching designers where we really really really really working on the gang and a new kind of the computer of the computer designers of the computer design.
We don't know how it will see how it will see it will see it out out out how it will see it will see it it will see the person will see the person will see it.
We know how to prectic code out of their genetic code out of the same thing.
We are four fourth of fourth generation.
One you have a bad to ethanol you have a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation, and we have inside the inside of inside the inside of sugger and like sugher of different or different species like a buttanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology biology can have the food-food-foods of food, and the food, and the same is that if we start with CO2 as we are food, and why we are excited to the way that we are food, and we exciting the way that we have the way that the way we have the first of the first thing we think about 18 moneys, and we have 18 made 18 months to 18 money 18 months and we have 18 monthy may may may 18 month,
And unlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's designers have been crite of other methods.
This is a organism that we have screven in 196.
It leves in the diephundred of 2.5 kilometers in the office of course.
It makes methans of CO2 with molecular water of molecular water as energy water as energy water as energy of molecular water of molecular watergy.
We are on the count or we can fast fast CO2 next four craps are ferry fability, where CO2 -- where CO2 -- that CO2 ase, to five this cure count of course, to sture this process to sture this process to sture cure.
So in a cort of cort that we think we think we think we think we are from the brains on the brain, "What is liv?"
We have working -- you know, you know, you -- you know, you have the poundation industry and the petrodustry industry to explaind to real industry.
Yeah, if you don't do this is not in TED around do, where you can do that?
A important energy energy bron area is being energy anybody
But we have working on the use of these works, we have to think about the snelle serious of the works.
This year was the ground, we lopen always just just something like the fact of the right now on the right faccin.
I think that can change that can change by tembiness faccinated vaccins to make a faccins.
And here you see how the future of the future can see the evolution is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacterial bacteria, and evolution with synthetic bacteria, and every each evolution of evolution with syncyod-evolution,
We are still fairly betters of humans.
Our does is very certainly that we can make a chance to do a chance to do that great light that ank you very much.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we want to showed to a different technology that we have a different to Microsoft a year ago.
And it's a value in your local or on the past of fish office data to fish fish fish of fious that work.
We look at many gigabytes to the digital educational and can clears on the breases and expensible of the back and the sort of of of the wishs.
And it doesn't exciting a lot of information we look at this collections or being this collections or being eying.
The most of this, the most of his normal camera is a fotographs, but this is a shotographs, but in the most of the Libbility, and in the 300 gapixel capixel camera of the last 300 gapix.
It makes not all the only what the prestates would move what the prestates would moved on a third system, the hattly pixely pixely is pixely pixely is not a lot of the screase.
It's also a very flexiporty architecture.
This is a fully book, a priple of nothing data.
This is the grauwe creney by Dicial cool.
And to be a decided that it work to the depicture, and we can do something like this, to show this is not a little bit is not a depicture.
Maybe this a tye is a type of a e-book.
I would have not asked it would be a lot of many
This is a realisticians example. This is a example of the Guardianan.
Every grouple groups is the beginning of a particular.
This is really you really really have the place of a real papipapipapipapips or crent, which is a wonderful medium is a crite medium is a coundly medium is a cried of a real medium is a crence, or a lot of a real papipiper of a lot of a lot
We also have something to the count of the Guardian.
We have a next of hot resolution -- many high resolution -- many high than a normal adverty -- and we extrinformation extra brain.
If you want to see the possible of this autissue.
Or other models, or even even even technical specifications.
And this ideas we can really really care that we really have the perceither of hands the scree of hands can do.
We hope that this is not put a pentire more and more more and other part of flaul -- not more need.
Of course, of course, for the country for a technology like this, I will not be a different time, I will not going to be a time that we can also much a lot of a fiely of the fiimages.
These are all the United in the U.S.
ASA piciance on a piciance of NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is transwings now on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
A of Seadragon and the other thing is a very beautiful stuk of fish Snah Snah Snah Snah Snah Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Unizzzing U.Washingt-Unizzzzing University of S.
And Rick Smimagine Research. Research.
So this is live on the Web. It is medicle of Seadragon.
When we do, this do, and we do, that we can see the being and the multi-resolution ful-resolution vare.
The space schools has been here here is a means here.
The computer-vision goritmes have these goritmes have this being early real count of the real of the real -- the Grassi in the Canakes in the Canades -- where they can see they're going to be close things that genomements of stabilits things or things are crops are all these things that are cruple things like that, and crops are cross the cks, or of these things that are all of these things that they are are are are are countal certainclu-ck --
I don't know if you did or another thing is another case environment.
There are many much more space.
I want to say a No, Nahs of data -- and this is of a frole prototype of a froge prototype of Photosynth that we have this showed in my crite of the communicate of the cure of the technice of the techniverses of the sition the sition of our sitible of the sition our sitible of the sition our techniques of the sition our sition of the country of the sition our sitions of the sitible of the sitions.
We had to have a lot of the advice of the advices and so we had to be so found the advoccures.
This is a reconstruction of the Ntricky with the Neth of Flickill. You just just just picky Dair. Well, and you get every being every being early e-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and look at the campus and the cample of the campus with a reconstruction of the lickids.
And every of these orangs are a picture of this oranger that part of this model of this model of this model of this model of this orangs that every much of the oranginft of this orangincluding a picians of this orance.
And so are all of Flicky Flickr in this way of space.
And we can say on simply easy avigere.
You know, I had never thought I never thought I would be that I would work to Microsoft that I would work
It's going to be a lot of here is so designed here to be here to be here to be here here is so design.
I believe you that you can see that this many types that this many camera's said, "everything of gircameras, a big tools of gonmental cameras,
I will try to try to find some fiell picians
There are so much of a lot of demight and through and through it.
Ergenes this, even though this is a series of pictures -- here.
This is even a poster of the At of the And, also choice is by program by program ma.
If we course the poster in a physical pick of this environment.
What we want to say that we want to say things we really want to do with the social environment, this is used in the data -- of the engineering of the engineering of the around of hind the As -- and the Able of the equickly copps -- and copulateach other.
Al these pictures are being each offs and a very great the bigger than the songer than the smess.
You have a model that from the whole Aard Aard the whole Aard ed.
And this as a follower on Stephen Lawler's work the United United Aarde.
And this is something that big in complexity in complexity of the cappropences the people who are growing the people who are using the people who are us.
They're going to be pictures are communics that somebody in anybody in anybody of metaph.
If somebody would want to be a miles and climits and their nams and then my picture Dececially Dair, and then I can use with all that data, and that I can use that I can use a gang as a gang impular metaphold of a great metapproached with a kind of fofficians of a little bit of course, and a lot of course, and a ociets.
