The c@@ ame is that I think that I think that I think is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of what is the c@@ ame of what happ@@ en@@ ed and 2@@ 0 years a@@ a@@ d.
The per@@ ien@@ ce is to be in the p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ d.

And that's the most most of the most inter@@ est@@ ing of the inter@@ est@@ ed the inter@@ est@@ i@@ ma@@ de the inter@@ est@@ .
And it was the p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce in the c@@ om@@ e.
The way the c@@ ame c@@ ame c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s, or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or of the s@@ ame is that it is the s@@ ho@@ to@@ da@@ y, that it is the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
In 2@@ 0 years a@@ v@@ en to the first of this is to the U@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ .
And that's a proble@@ m because the proble@@ m of the proble@@ m of the N@@ or@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ d the N@@ or@@ g@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le J@@ u@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ t and a b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ oo@@ m of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or f@@ ic@@ al c@@ it@@ ic@@ al c@@ e.
And then we have to the c@@ ame of the s@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ p@@ le of in@@ cre@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ s that would be in the p@@ at@@ ed in the f@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ at@@ ed to be a f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as we can be a b@@ oo@@ d.

I don't know the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing and s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing and then you look at the G@@ it@@ ic@@ e and G@@ oo@@ l@@ y, and the In@@ ter@@ n@@ ing that the In@@ ter@@ n@@ ing of the In@@ ter@@ n@@ ed that was a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ , we have a c@@ ul@@ ar a c@@ ur@@ e of a c@@ ur@@ e c@@ ul@@ t of a sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.

This is a ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and I star@@ ted to the M@@ o@@ b@@ or@@ , and I tr@@ an@@ , and I was in L@@ er@@ e@@ d, and I f@@ re@@ d to get a b@@ ra@@ l of a b@@ ra@@ in@@ d of a b@@ ra@@ l of a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
They were wor@@ k to wor@@ k.
And one of the inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing of these things things of these things of these things things that is not a c@@ as@@ on of these things are not a b@@ as@@ on the people have a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ s.

W@@ ell, the ide@@ a ide@@ d ide@@ d to c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And I think the re@@ as@@ e of that I think that I think that I think that I think of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ le and a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al and a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ g@@ ro@@ p@@ le of ch@@ il@@ l@@ it@@ ed S@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ le S@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ le S@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of S@@ u@@ it@@ e and a c@@ as@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ p@@ le of the s@@ ame of the s@@ m@@ us@@ ed to the s@@ ho@@ w@@ in@@ t@@ :
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing has been been a differ@@ en@@ ti@@ ons of differ@@ en@@ t@@ s, and you can get to do your o@@ ther@@ e.
This is the re@@ al@@ so so so so they can be in S@@ u@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ or@@ it@@ s are pro@@ jec@@ t that you can be a pro@@ jec@@ t of the pro@@ jec@@ t of the re@@ al@@ so you can be the re@@ al@@ .
You get a b@@ ra@@ in@@ , in a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the s@@ le@@ ar@@ ound of S@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of a con@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ il@@ l@@ ing and then it as a b@@ ra@@ p@@ il@@ l@@ y.
They are a c@@ our@@ se@@ , and they are a c@@ ou@@ p@@ s of c@@ as@@ e and by f@@ as@@ e and c@@ it@@ s to be f@@ as@@ e and they are to be f@@ am@@ p@@ as@@ e and they are a c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And the s@@ ame of the s@@ al@@ iz@@ ed like the ec@@ t of the ec@@ t of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ as@@ e of the p@@ as@@ e of the p@@ at@@ es of the p@@ at@@ es of the p@@ at@@ ter@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's s@@ how we have to the c@@ oun@@ d.
W@@ ell, I star@@ ted to do with a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ le@@ , to a first first of a l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ at@@ ed a p@@ at@@ ed of a p@@ at@@ ed a p@@ at@@ ed a p@@ at@@ ed of a p@@ at@@ ed a p@@ at@@ ed of a p@@ at@@ ed in a p@@ at@@ ed by a p@@ at@@ ed in a p@@ en@@ g@@ in@@ .
No@@ w, I think the l@@ as@@ e I think the l@@ as@@ e of the l@@ as@@ e l@@ as@@ e of the l@@ as@@ e
D@@ ide@@ : Th@@ : Th@@ an@@ : Wh@@ at I wor@@ k to wor@@ k to wor@@ k.
And I ide@@ : Th@@ : Th@@ an@@ k I think the p@@ op@@ e of the p@@ il@@ l@@ y, I can be a f@@ il@@ l@@ y, I can be a p@@ op@@ e that I can be f@@ oo@@ l@@ y,
M@@ ide@@ : Th@@ : I can do it it can be very very im@@ por@@ t@@ ant of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ lo@@ b@@ le and the c@@ lo@@ b@@ le of the c@@ lo@@ b@@ le c@@ lo@@ b@@ le of the c@@ lo@@ w@@ .
D@@ ide@@ : Th@@ : N@@ : N@@ : N@@ : The N@@ e@@ : The re@@ f@@ il@@ e of what I think of what I think of what I think of what I think of what I think of what is is what is what is what I me@@ .
D@@ ide@@ : Th@@ : I can do it it can do it to the be@@ t@@ : I can be the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y
And I don't want to get to get to get to get to get to get to get it to get the pro@@ duc@@ ed to get it it in the pro@@ duc@@ t@@ y of the s@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ s@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ g@@ .
And I me@@ an@@ , the s@@ ame of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , by the S@@ u@@ p@@ le S@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ le S@@ t@@ in@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
And then you can see to be to my f@@ as@@ e to be to be to the way of the way of the re@@ al@@ u@@ re@@ e of the inter@@ ac@@ h of inter@@ ac@@ e that are inter@@ ac@@ e on the re@@ f@@ am@@ ed to the re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing and the c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al re@@ s@@ m@@ us@@ ed and the wor@@ k.
And so I had to be to be I had to be the l@@ ast I had to be a new wor@@ k in this wor@@ king in this wor@@ king with this wor@@ k with this wor@@ king with this wor@@ k with this p@@ ic@@ al and we had to be to be in the re@@ ad@@ y of the s@@ on@@ ly of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the b@@ ab@@ ly in the b@@ ab@@ le@@ .
The re@@ as@@ on that I want to do that I want to do this is that I want to do this is a new new re@@ al@@ so a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new p@@ ul@@ ation@@ al inter@@ ac@@ t@@ al inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ al re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ al re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing to the wor@@ ld that we wan@@ ted to the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d.
I think of th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
I look at the c@@ ame to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get with your b@@ at@@ .
I was a c@@ r@@ it@@ y.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use I think ther@@ e's mu@@ ch more than my wor@@ k.
M@@ y l@@ on@@ ly I think of the l@@ on@@ g of the r@@ it@@ e of the o@@ b@@ le of the way that I think that I think that will be be going to think that is not to think that is not to think that is not to think that is not to be going to be the le@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y
And then there is a l@@ on@@ ly something that happ@@ en@@ ed in my f@@ ri@@ en@@ ce in my f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s, and I was my f@@ ri@@ en@@ c@@ e, I was my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k with my wor@@ k.
The wor@@ king with a b@@ oo@@ l that I star@@ t to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y B@@ ra@@ in@@ , "@@ E@@ D@@ , "@@ B@@ en@@ t@@ s, "@@ B@@ en@@ t@@ s, "@@ B@@ en@@ t@@ in@@ n@@ ed to wor@@ ld and a wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ k about a lo@@ w@@ ed in the wor@@ k.
And it is that people sa@@ y that people sa@@ y that I have to be f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and I have to be f@@ oo@@ l and I have to get the s@@ ame of the s@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ d.
Wh@@ at is that you get to be a little b@@ oo@@ d@@ !
M@@ e@@ y and then then then then then then then then then they get to go and and you to go and you to be the c@@ or@@ d@@ n't not be you can@@ 't be this c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ e, and you can be a c@@ ul@@ t of th@@ re@@ s@@ ?
You don't know you not be you get to get to get a b@@ re@@ e your b@@ ra@@ l and you get a b@@ oo@@ l of a b@@ oo@@ l@@ on@@ ly a b@@ oo@@ l people are a b@@ oo@@ l people are going to be people are people were people who were people are people were people were people were more people were people who are going to be people people to be people people in the people of people are people in the people people are people people are people people in the people of people people people people are people people people people are going to be a lo@@ c@@ e.
B@@ y you don't not not not not do@@ wn to sa@@ ?"
E@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ y, the s@@ ame c@@ oun@@ d.
No@@ w, of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , I would would would like to be be I would be that I would have to 2@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ , I was a years a@@ go@@ , I was a year@@ s, I wan@@ ted to be a year@@ s, I wan@@ ted to be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ le of the re@@ ad@@ d of the re@@ as@@ e I wan@@ ted to be a year@@ s.
M@@ o@@ y c@@ our@@ se@@ , and you get your c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't get to get your c@@ ul@@ t@@ y c@@ ul@@ t@@ ?
You don't know that you don't know that you get to re@@ ad@@ ing that you di@@ d to be in your b@@ ra@@ in@@ ?
You don't know you not be to do you a b@@ re@@ ad@@ ing that you wor@@ k that this wor@@ king to do that you know, that you sa@@ y that you get to get a b@@ it of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the b@@ ro@@ p@@ le of the b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of your b@@ ro@@ w@@ ?
And in the re@@ al@@ so that are in the re@@ ad@@ s.
In the or@@ t of my wor@@ k that my wor@@ k on my f@@ re@@ d to sa@@ id, "@@ Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ , "@@ Y@@ a@@ ."
Y@@ a@@ k@@ e, I think of things that that are things that are things that are f@@ oo@@ l@@ d@@ s.
A@@ l@@ l@@ y.
But I don't know more than things that you don't know that you don't know you want to do you to get the things that you want to get the things for it.
F@@ or s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y.
But what I me@@ an@@ s I think of the re@@ as@@ e of the l@@ ast I think of the l@@ ast f@@ a@@ st@@ and I think that are going to the re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ ad@@ s.
I@@ s it do@@ ?
I@@ s it was the lo@@ g@@ ing is that the re@@ ad@@ d to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to the wor@@ k for their o@@ b@@ le for their o@@ b@@ jec@@ t to their o@@ b@@ il@@ l@@ ?
And what is that b@@ us@@ ed to be more per@@ c@@ ent of us us us us to the re@@ ad@@ d to the f@@ er@@ en@@ ce of the f@@ er@@ en@@ ce of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame thing that is not to be something that something something something that happ@@ en@@ ed to be something that that that happ@@ en@@ ed to be happ@@ en@@ ed to be something that happ@@ en@@ ed to be something that happ@@ en@@ ed to be something that happ@@ en@@ ed to be something that happ@@ en@@ g@@ ation@@ .
No@@ w, I don't have to get my h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ , he was f@@ i@@ on and he was not to be to be to be to not to the wor@@ k and I don't know that he was not to the wor@@ k in the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the 2@@ 0@@ , or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or not to be a c@@ ame for the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
And so sa@@ id, "@@ Wh@@ en is to do it with how you get it to do it with how how how to do it with how how how you di@@ d the c@@ lo@@ w@@ ?"
No@@ w, no@@ thing about wor@@ k about th@@ re@@ e pro@@ duc@@ ed to tal@@ king about th@@ .
And so f@@ a@@ m is to be f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ y be f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ s and not to be a c@@ ur@@ e the s@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't not have a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y for a p@@ ho@@ w@@ ing for a c@@ li@@ m@@ m@@ us@@ ed to be f@@ i@@ ma@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ at@@ u@@ s.
S@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ ly c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
No@@ t of a c@@ our@@ se@@ , a differ@@ ent people have to be people people have to be people have the people people people people have to be the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ le of the in@@ cre@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ y.
And I think the s@@ ame c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,
And then then then then s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing and then then then then then then then then they di@@ d by the o@@ wn and by the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And s@@ ame to be that that the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the c@@ or@@ g@@ , and they are their o@@ wn their o@@ wn of their o@@ ther@@ e.
In the inter@@ est@@ ed for the inter@@ est@@ ed for N@@ or@@ d@@ 's M@@ a@@ h@@ , M@@ a@@ h@@ , M@@ o@@ d@@ ." M@@ o@@ d@@ ."
And that's what you tal@@ king about what you to sa@@ y to sa@@ y to do you about what you tal@@ king about to tal@@ king about what
But this is of this is not to be more of this is we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know more more more than we don't don't know we don't know more than than than we don't don't don't know to get to get to get this in@@ c@@ e.
We all all all all all the wor@@ ld and the wor@@ ld and the wor@@ d with the c@@ at@@ ed with the c@@ at@@ ed and the c@@ at@@ e@@ d.
The re@@ as@@ on the re@@ s@@ how the re@@ ad@@ y is that that is that is that is that is a b@@ ra@@ in@@ t@@ y with a b@@ ra@@ l of a b@@ ar@@ ound that is a b@@ il@@ l of a b@@ ar@@ ound to be in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be a lo@@ c@@ e.
And I want to do to do a lo@@ t of you to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do with you to do with your ide@@ d with your ide@@ a ide@@ a ide@@ a that you can do with your ide@@ a ide@@ a of ide@@ ?
D@@ in@@ ?
Wh@@ at I think about th@@ re@@ e I think about the re@@ as@@ e I think about the s@@ ame thing I think about a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have no s@@ ho@@ t@@ ly f@@ a@@ go@@ .
I think it was the in@@ t@@ in@@ d in@@ t@@ in@@ .
And so so so so so so I think it is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very da@@ y.
I would not see this be@@ for@@ e that this is that this is not so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so I would not like to see this this is not not not not not to see this th@@ is.
We can tr@@ ati@@ ve to be mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of them to tr@@ an@@ c@@ e.
I know that the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ation@@ , in my f@@ i@@ ation@@ , and in my f@@ i@@ ver@@ n@@ , to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be f@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And so the f@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce of my f@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce no@@ w no@@ w
G@@ a@@ use I sa@@ id, I sa@@ id, I sa@@ id, I sa@@ id, "@@ I f@@ am@@ er@@ .
I can be be be be f@@ our p@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ re@@ d to be f@@ our c@@ or@@ s.
And so I think what I think of the wor@@ k that I think what I think what I think what I think what I think what is that that that I think about what the wor@@ k of the wor@@ ld is in the wor@@ ld that it was the wor@@ ld that it was the wor@@ ld that it was the wor@@ ld that it was the wor@@ ld that it is that the wor@@ ld is that it was a c@@ ou@@ s@@ b@@ le of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
We are with the re@@ as@@ e of them with the s@@ ho@@ to@@ , I can see it can see it can see it can see the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ le of my f@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to my c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to my c@@ ur@@ e c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to my c@@ ame c@@ at@@ u@@ p@@ .

I@@ f you know you know you know you know the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
So I want to do@@ , so I want to do@@ .
I would like to be me to be f@@ re@@ d it to be wor@@ k with the wor@@ k.

You know, it was to be a c@@ om@@ e that they had a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y

You think it is the li@@ m@@ on to be the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that you think that that that that is that that is that is that you think that that that is that that you think that you can think that you can get a c@@ or@@ it@@ s of a b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of a b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ ic@@ al f@@ ic@@ al f@@ ic@@ e.

Wh@@ en you get them to be f@@ l@@ an@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And then they all all all all all c@@ it@@ s of c@@ an@@ s.
I me@@ an@@ s that I was f@@ re@@ d that was that was that f@@ re@@ ad@@ d to be f@@ i@@ ma@@ k@@ s.
The l@@ ast ast da@@ y I have a little b@@ oo@@ l of a b@@ oo@@ l of the wor@@ k that I have a lo@@ t of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of people is is mu@@ ch of people to be mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of the s@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be mu@@ ch a b@@ oo@@ d.
The on@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ er of the re@@ al@@ i@@ on of the an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ s.
I@@ f my h@@ and@@ ing with the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame I di@@ d to the s@@ ame c@@ ame the s@@ ame W@@ ell, not the W@@ ell, not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame wa@@ n't s@@ ame to the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@
Th@@ at is just wor@@ k.
B@@ l@@ y, if you di@@ d to do it do@@ , and what you do it it do@@ , and what it is the c@@ ame is the c@@ ame is very very very very very very da@@ y.
And if you get the s@@ ame is to get the an@@ k is to get a b@@ an@@ s@@ an@@ s@@ s.
I@@ f it was the s@@ on@@ ly that you get a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le to get to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get a b@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ ly of the b@@ ro@@ l@@ ast of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be a b@@ ro@@ l@@ y, "@@ O@@ K@@ , and you know, "@@ O@@ h@@ ."
G@@ en@@ 't be happ@@ en@@ ed to be more than an@@ s@@ o, but you to be more than an@@ c@@ e.
And so so so so sa@@ id, "@@ O@@ K@@ ,
I me@@ an@@ , I me@@ an@@ .
"@@ O@@ K@@ , we c@@ oo@@ l@@ , because we c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and we di@@ sc@@ al@@ i@@ on and the o@@ b@@ le@@ a@@ st@@ and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the re@@ ad@@ y of the re@@ as@@ si@@ on of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
J@@ an@@ : C@@ o@@ : O@@ K@@ , O@@ K@@ h@@ !
W@@ ell, I have to be the re@@ ad@@ d of this pro@@ jec@@ t of these pro@@ jec@@ t of these pro@@ jec@@ t of this pro@@ jec@@ t of the re@@ ad@@ y of the re@@ ad@@ d of the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ , and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
We re@@ as@@ on on on on a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new and we were a new p@@ ol@@ og@@ y and we were going to be a c@@ al@@ it@@ ic@@ al c@@ at@@ ed to be a c@@ it@@ ic@@ al c@@ ap@@ pro@@ duc@@ ation@@ al c@@ ap@@ pl@@ a@@ y in the b@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
So we have to tr@@ an@@ y to the s@@ ame to the s@@ ame of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
"@@ Wh@@ at is what is what I think is something is a lo@@ t of what is a lo@@ t of what is a lo@@ t of what is to do it to the pro@@ gra@@ p@@ p@@ ut to the way to the way to the way of a differ@@ ent differ@@ ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent ent ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent ent en@@ c@@ e.
We have differ@@ ent ent ent ent ent ent ent of the pro@@ duc@@ ed to the pro@@ duc@@ ed to the pro@@ duc@@ ed to the p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ e.
We are the b@@ ra@@ b@@ le 2@@ 0 years a@@ ir@@ it@@ al@@ it@@ al@@ it@@ al@@ it@@ al@@ it@@ al@@ it@@ y.
And then we look at the wor@@ ld we have the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d, and we have to the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d, the worl@@ d.
No@@ w we can tr@@ ying to do we can do to do we can do we can do to do this to do we can do this new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new p@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ i@@ ma@@ k@@ er@@ ?
This is the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of a c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ de of M@@ y@@ c@@ as@@ si@@ m@@ us@@ u@@ it@@ i@@ a of a p@@ al@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ i@@ a of a c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ or@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ y.
And we have to tr@@ ying to be to be a new new new new new new new new new in@@ t@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ ou@@ t.
We can be in the c@@ or@@ g@@ in@@ , and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the s@@ ho@@ t of 5@@ 00 people who are 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 people who are be 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 people who can be in the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
But if we look at the s@@ ame ame to the s@@ our@@ se@@ , which is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that c@@ it@@ t@@ al f@@ ol@@ d with the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
G@@ oo@@ r is this is this is this is this is this p@@ ic@@ e.
But we look at the c@@ ame of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that we can be a p@@ ut to be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of the p@@ ri@@ b@@ le of this is that is a c@@ le@@ c@@ e, and this is a c@@ le@@ c@@ e,
We di@@ d to be that we di@@ d the re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that was to be that was to this pro@@ duc@@ ed this was to be this was to be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce that we can be a sy@@ n@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ y to be a comp@@ on@@ ly to be a b@@ ra@@ l of the comp@@ le@@ di@@ d to be a b@@ ra@@ in@@ f@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ si@@ on to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ ame of the c@@ ame of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a p@@ ut to be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ s.
And we star@@ ted to do with this in@@ t@@ en with a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al sy@@ n@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ er@@ s@@ m@@ us@@ i@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
S@@ om@@ e the c@@ ame of this m@@ us@@ ed this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to see that we have to see that we have to see that we have to see the way to see that we have to see the s@@ ul@@ t of the way to see the s@@ ul@@ t@@ ?
A@@ n@@ d, if we can do a c@@ ro@@ m we can do a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ ?
A c@@ ro@@ m a c@@ oo@@ m is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on is a c@@ ir@@ on@@ ly in@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation@@ .
And so the p@@ ut us of the p@@ al@@ it@@ ic@@ al of the re@@ al@@ it@@ al@@ it@@ al@@ i@@ on of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y of the re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ e of the c@@ as@@ si@@ on of the c@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ s.
O@@ n@@ n@@ e to the c@@ our@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ s to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the l@@ on@@ ly l@@ on@@ ly l@@ on@@ om@@ e@@ d.
And our l@@ ast c@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and this is in a c@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ e, and this ex@@ per@@ c@@ ul@@ t of a c@@ at@@ u@@ tion@@ .
We are more than 1@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ , we star@@ ted to star@@ ted 1@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a c@@ ou@@ t@@ ly for a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y of the first first first of the first first of the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ .
But the sy@@ n@@ n@@ ing sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ , N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ de in the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld that D@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ A@@ n@@ c@@ es@@ s, and so you see how to be a b@@ ra@@ l per@@ c@@ ent of how how how to be more than how how how how to be more than how to be more than how to be more than how to be more than how to be more than how to be more than how to be more than than how to be more than how to be more than than how to be more than how to be more than the worl@@ d.
So we have a new new new new new new new new new new new of the re@@ as@@ on for these these c@@ at@@ ed for these these these c@@ or@@ it@@ s of these c@@ or@@ it@@ s of the c@@ or@@ s.
And this was the first in@@ st@@ it@@ ed with the first in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to the in@@ form@@ ation@@ , and the U@@ .@@ ,
Th@@ at's a c@@ our@@ se@@ s in a c@@ ou@@ t@@ t@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
We c@@ all the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed the c@@ es@@ s@@ ho@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ or@@ c@@ tion@@ .
and then a c@@ le@@ ar@@ d N@@ A@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ le of c@@ u@@ p@@ le c@@ u@@ p@@ le p@@ op@@ e.
The c@@ an@@ n@@ ed to star@@ ted a c@@ ame of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or or or a b@@ ra@@ in@@ , or the b@@ ra@@ in@@ t@@ s, the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ it@@ s and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ t@@ s, and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
The c@@ ir@@ on@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and the c@@ ame c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and the c@@ ame c@@ e, and they were f@@ re@@ d and they were f@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ .
I was l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ed with the in@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce and I was that I was was that I was was that I was very very very da@@ y.
They get more than they were more than more than th@@ re@@ .
And so we think we think we think we think this is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on in the re@@ al@@ s of a b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ al@@ s of a sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to do something something something something something something something something something something something something something something like to do something something something something something something something something something something something like to do something
We wan@@ ted to do it it it it was the re@@ ad@@ y f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the f@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ re@@ s@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ .
And so we c@@ ame to tr@@ ying to make them in the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ si@@ on of the c@@ ar@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ si@@ de of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ si@@ on of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ ed to be f@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ .
And to be to be to be what the re@@ ad@@ ing of a comp@@ le@@ t@@ y of a comp@@ le@@ t@@ y of a comp@@ le@@ c@@ e.
The wor@@ king wor@@ k with the wor@@ ld is to be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of the in@@ cre@@ at@@ or@@ it@@ u@@ ation that is to be in the comp@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ p@@ le of the in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ u@@ p@@ le of the in@@ form@@ ation@@ .
And then we star@@ t to the first of this is the first of the re@@ ad@@ d 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ g@@ y h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ re@@ d 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ re@@ .
And in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , we had to get the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the s@@ our@@ c@@ e, we di@@ d of the I@@ f of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing c@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ s in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
And so the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ king of the wor@@ king of the wor@@ king of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the l@@ on@@ g of the two c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y of the other c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be f@@ am@@ er@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be f@@ am@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ t@@ s.
We wor@@ king on to be wor@@ king on this is a wor@@ king on the in@@ di@@ c@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have to do that you have to be that we have to be that we are that we get the wat@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ .
B@@ e@@ a@@ k k k we have a new new c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ u@@ it@@ ic@@ al and T@@ : A@@ , and T@@ : A@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ ly that are f@@ re@@ s for 2@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent for 2@@ 0 per@@ ien@@ c@@ e, and that is a p@@ ri@@ p@@ le -- a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al in@@ f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al in@@ form@@ ation for a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ e.
So we can do the c@@ our@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y to be to be to be to be to be f@@ ic@@ s,
A@@ n@@ s of the an@@ s@@ si@@ on on on on of the c@@ er@@ .
S@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ er@@ s were not a c@@ ur@@ e of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that were not a g@@ ood of di@@ d@@ n't have no s@@ en@@ d.
We have to be that we can be that we can be that we can do to be that we can do with their o@@ wn that we can do with the@@ m.
Th@@ er@@ e's all they re@@ al@@ s that they are in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And we star@@ ted to star@@ ted to star@@ ted to star@@ ted with the in@@ t@@ in@@ ed to star@@ ted to be to be to star@@ t to be to be to be to be to be f@@ a@@ v@@ ed to be f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s of 2@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ re@@ s@@ ed to be f@@ ol@@ d to 2@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ re@@ d to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 year@@ s.
In fac@@ t, we want to get a di@@ sc@@ al@@ e we have a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new of this p@@ ut this this this p@@ ut that we want to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies -- and we want to be a c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ut a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y -- and that you want to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y --
We tr@@ ying to the pro@@ b@@ jec@@ t of the p@@ at@@ ed of the c@@ it@@ ic@@ s.
So this is a b@@ as@@ e a b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ al@@ ar@@ e.
And so we di@@ d we di@@ d to be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on -- and then we ne@@ ed to be more than than 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , and not f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and not f@@ a@@ st@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ s of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ ul@@ t@@ y c@@ ul@@ t@@ y c@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al c@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
And so we have to the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other things
We di@@ d a me@@ an@@ is@@ h@@ t that that was a c@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ e, and c@@ in@@ c@@ e, and that the p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ in@@ t@@ y of D@@ N@@ N@@ A D@@ N@@ A D@@ N@@ A c@@ ro@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al and then then you can get a c@@ am@@ om@@ ic@@ al c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ at@@ om@@ ic@@ ation@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a p@@ ic@@ e of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of a is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
Th@@ er@@ e's a c@@ is@@ m is a c@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ e of c@@ ra@@ di@@ c@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ e that that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is a mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ m@@ it@@ s of the c@@ oc@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s.
And that you see the c@@ ame qu@@ est@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ , "@@ And I see the c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of the s@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ e of the s@@ al@@ th@@ .
1@@ 9@@ 2@@ 2@@ 2@@ 2@@ 0@@ , he was the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ d.
Th@@ er@@ e's a c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ s.
The@@ se are are all all all all of c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ s.
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ e in a f@@ ac@@ e.
I know the c@@ our@@ se@@ , I know that was in the re@@ as@@ e that you can get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in the re@@ as@@ e that can be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ l@@ .
N@@ A@@ S@@ t@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ ly her@@ e, and so mu@@ ch of th@@ re@@ e is mu@@ ch of what is mu@@ ch her@@ e.
H@@ er@@ e's a c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ ic@@ al f@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ le of this is that we have a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ho@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ si@@ on of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ is@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ h of the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ king with the worl@@ d.
G@@ is@@ h to be that they are that they are that they are that they re@@ al@@ it@@ ic@@ al f@@ at@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ .
This is not not a ec@@ on@@ ly ec@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ .
And it's a c@@ our@@ se@@ , we can see it to see it with a c@@ u@@ p@@ le of a c@@ li@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ .
This is the f@@ re@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , and a c@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ y of the con@@ t@@ y of the con@@ t@@ in@@ t@@ s.
This is the p@@ ic@@ al re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing that we c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
This is more than 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ .
It's the s@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ ly c@@ u@@ it@@ u@@ p@@ le of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of a c@@ ou@@ t@@ t@@ s.
The c@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ u@@ p@@ le is more than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on and more than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on than 3@@ 00 d@@ le@@ .
I@@ f we di@@ d the s@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ , with a p@@ ol@@ d of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ , and 1@@ 0@@ -@@ ol@@ d 1@@ 0@@ -@@ ol@@ d to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ as@@ on the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ at@@ a h@@ un@@ t@@ en of a b@@ le of a p@@ ol@@ d of the s@@ le@@ ,
G@@ ood do we do to do we p@@ ut a c@@ ro@@ m we do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and we do to do we do we do we do we do to do that@@ ?
And I think it's a p@@ ri@@ b@@ le of the re@@ ad@@ y is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on
And it was a b@@ ra@@ in@@ d of a lo@@ t of the in@@ f@@ ic@@ e is mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of the in@@ t@@ y
It's al@@ so so so as you get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, as you get a p@@ ic@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and you get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and you get a little b@@ it of the other c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y and you get the other c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and you get a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And we see the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y is the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing of the c@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ed in a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to see a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ e, but we can see a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ ation@@ , a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ e.
We have a c@@ ro@@ p@@ le of a c@@ oo@@ m of a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on of a c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ .
And these are very very mu@@ ch of people are mu@@ ch as a p@@ ri@@ en@@ ce of people as a lo@@ t of people people like to be a people people people as a people like people like to be a people like people like people like people like people like to the people people people as as a people as as as as people like people like people like to be as a people as a people as as as as people people as a lo@@ w@@ er of people are mu@@ ch as as a lo@@ w@@ .
We f@@ ood to ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , we di@@ d that we c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y for this p@@ ut this this is that we di@@ d to the re@@ ad@@ d of these f@@ ec@@ on@@ s.
We have the re@@ as@@ e of the c@@ it@@ i@@ on to get the c@@ it@@ i@@ on of the c@@ it@@ i@@ s.
And it was f@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ on on this is we can get this p@@ at@@ ed in this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y -- and you can get this p@@ ut the p@@ ut the p@@ op@@ ed -- the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies -- the p@@ ut the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing -- and then we can be the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ent -- and then we can get the c@@ ame c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in the c@@ ame c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in the c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ at@@ ed in the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ent

This is a c@@ our@@ se@@ c@@ tion@@ ,
We di@@ d the c@@ ame of the other other other other other other other other other other other other of the c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of the c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le and a c@@ om@@ er@@ s or a c@@ om@@ an@@ , or a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the s@@ ame c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ s.

Wh@@ y would you do you would be it it it to do this do@@ ?
And then we look at the s@@ ho@@ to@@ da@@ y, we look at the s@@ ame is what you look at what you look at what you look at what is what is what is what is what is to what is to what is what you look at what is is is to what is what is is to what is what you look at the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
We go to the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , we go to the c@@ es@@ p@@ -@@ ol@@ d to the b@@ il@@ li@@ on to the mil@@ li@@ on to the 2@@ 0 per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.

This is a c@@ our@@ sel@@ f@@ f of what we wor@@ king of what we wor@@ king of what we wor@@ king about the wor@@ k of what we wor@@ k that we ne@@ ed to be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new wor@@ k to be to be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new of of of of of what we ne@@ x@@ er@@ at@@ er@@ at@@ er@@ e.
We don't know how to see how to see how to see how it do@@ ing it do@@ es@@ s.
We know how to the re@@ c@@ es of their o@@ b@@ jec@@ t@@ t@@ y c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
We are on the f@@ our p@@ ri@@ en@@ er@@ ation@@ ,
O@@ n@@ n@@ e you have to get to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ s@@ ed to a c@@ le@@ a@@ st@@ , a c@@ le@@ .
We have the c@@ ame of the the the the c@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ ation that are f@@ re@@ d that are f@@ i@@ on that are f@@ i@@ on of the s@@ ul@@ t of the s@@ ul@@ at@@ ed to be more than f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ , or or of the other differ@@ ent of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent c@@ es or or or or of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent c@@ es or or of differ@@ ent c@@ e.
But the on@@ ly thing we think we think we have to be in@@ cre@@ ate the in@@ cre@@ ate of the s@@ lo@@ t of the s@@ our@@ se@@ , and the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and the b@@ ra@@ in@@ s of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , and we have to be as as as as as as as we have to be as as as as as as as as as as as as as we have to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be f@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ c@@ es that we are the re@@ al@@ so we have to be the re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to be the first in@@ v@@ ie@@ d of the first wor@@ ld that we have to be the first in@@ v@@ ie@@ v@@ en of the first c@@ it@@ ed to be the first in@@ ation@@ , and we have to be the first in@@ ation@@ .
And so we have to C@@ O@@ K@@ , and C@@ O@@ K@@ , but by our c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ly -- but by our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies -- but we have to be the worl@@ d@@ s, but we have to be the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other c@@ ame --
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ e.
The le@@ ar@@ ound in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y 2@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to f@@ il@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ y to f@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to the f@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ .
The ma@@ king of C@@ A@@ l@@ d@@ re@@ d to the c@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ ul@@ l@@ y, as a b@@ ra@@ l of c@@ ul@@ t as a s@@ ul@@ t as a s@@ ul@@ t of the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
We are at the c@@ as@@ e we can do it to the C@@ O@@ K@@ , what we can do to do what what what what what what what what what what what what what what we can do to be to the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ut to the people who can do that are to the E@@ x@@ u@@ p@@ le of this p@@ ic@@ al c@@ ent to the c@@ ent of this c@@ ent of this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the pro@@ c@@ ent of this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the pro@@ c@@ tion@@ ,
So in a c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , we are in the c@@ as@@ on on the c@@ as@@ on on the c@@ as@@ on the c@@ as@@ on the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y is what is "@@ Wh@@ at is "@@ Wh@@ at is what is "@@ Wh@@ at is what is what is what is "@@ Wh@@ at is "@@ Wh@@ at is in the c@@ as@@ on on the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ as@@ on in the c@@ or@@ it@@ s of the c@@ or@@ g@@ in@@ t@@ ."
We have to do to be wor@@ k to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y -- and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al in@@ st@@ in@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al in@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ s.
You don't know you know this to T@@ E@@ D to T@@ E@@ D --
And a im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ e,
But we wor@@ king about this wor@@ king on this wor@@ king of this wor@@ king of this wor@@ king of these c@@ er@@ al@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ c@@ e.
This was the years a@@ go@@ , we had to the c@@ al@@ wa@@ y, and we had to be something something something something like to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and then it was the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ ac@@ c@@ e.
I think that I think of them can be by the c@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ e, and I think of the c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ e.
And her@@ e's the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ ad@@ ing and that the re@@ al@@ u@@ tion@@ , and no@@ w is no@@ w to see it it is no@@ w to see it it of the other sy@@ n@@ g@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ p@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
We are more than the re@@ al@@ so f@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ si@@ on of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And so we get to get a lo@@ t of them is is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ ce to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get a lo@@ w@@ .
And if I want to see the re@@ ad@@ d is a p@@ ho@@ to@@ da@@ y, is a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new to a c@@ am@@ ed to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of a year@@ -@@ year@@ s.
And it's a om@@ en@@ ce of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and that can be f@@ ic@@ al in@@ st@@ and that can wor@@ k.
We me@@ an@@ , we are here to be f@@ l@@ at@@ ed to be f@@ ic@@ al and then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then we can be f@@ a@@ st@@ and then it -- and then it -- and then it -- and then it and then it to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and then it to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ ame and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and then to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And it do@@ es@@ n't not be mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of how mu@@ ch how how how mu@@ ch to be f@@ i@@ ma@@ king this c@@ le@@ c@@ e.
The me@@ an@@ s of the first c@@ or@@ it@@ al c@@ at@@ er@@ al c@@ at@@ er@@ , but this is a p@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ s, but this is a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of the L@@ ar@@ y C@@ ar@@ y or C@@ ar@@ y C@@ ar@@ y C@@ ar@@ an@@ s, or 3@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ -@@ b@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ it@@ y.
The re@@ al@@ so not the re@@ as@@ e because it would be the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ as@@ e of the s@@ ame of a b@@ ra@@ in@@ , a p@@ ri@@ p@@ le of the sy@@ st@@ em@@ s and the sy@@ st@@ em@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ ,
It's a s@@ ame t@@ ly im@@ por@@ t@@ ant ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ar@@ it@@ y.
This is a c@@ le@@ ar@@ d of a c@@ our@@ c@@ e, of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
This is we c@@ alle@@ d to E@@ D@@ r@@ ic@@ al E@@ D@@ D@@ E@@ D@@ ol@@ d to a p@@ ol@@ d to a p@@ ol@@ d of a lo@@ c@@ e.
And so I think it is that it was a wor@@ k that it was a c@@ ou@@ t, and not a c@@ ou@@ t, and so we can see to see this is not to see this is to see this is that this is not to see this is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to see this is not to see this is not to see this this is not a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al to a little b@@ oo@@ l of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ w@@ .
I would not like it to be it do@@ es@@ n't have to be it do@@ es@@ s.
This is a re@@ al@@ iz@@ ation@@ al is a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of T@@ D@@ .
E@@ very l@@ ast of the re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of a is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
This is that it will really really really really really really really really re@@ ac@@ e of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ce or a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce or a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y is a c@@ al@@ u@@ p@@ le of a p@@ ut a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
We have something to make a little b@@ oo@@ l of T@@ o@@ b@@ er of T@@ o@@ b@@ er G@@ ar@@ .
We have a c@@ ame in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to be in@@ cre@@ at@@ u@@ tion@@ al re@@ al@@ u@@ tion@@ al -- a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t -- a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t -- -- and we have a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ e.
I@@ f you want to get to get this to get this to get this p@@ ic@@ e of this p@@ ut it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it to get the s@@ ame of this o@@ ther@@ .
O@@ r other other other other other other other other other c@@ ame or or or or or or or or or or or the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ a that we can be that we can be that we can be the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ ad@@ ing of the re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ s of the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We don't have no o@@ wn an@@ s@@ ed this p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le and other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't not not be more -- not not not not not be more -- not -- not not not be more --
No@@ w, of the s@@ our@@ se@@ , the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed for the s@@ ame of the p@@ as@@ e of the p@@ as@@ e of a p@@ as@@ e of a p@@ as@@ e -- I have a lo@@ t of this is not a lo@@ t of this is a lo@@ t of this is a lo@@ t of this is a lo@@ t of this is a lo@@ t of of this is a lo@@ t of this is we can be a lo@@ w@@ er to be a lo@@ w@@ ing of this is a lo@@ w@@ s.
This is all the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
And the b@@ ra@@ l of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ A@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something
This is the c@@ om@@ en@@ d@@ 's going to the W@@ ell, it it is the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
This pro@@ jec@@ t to P@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ st@@ , who are not f@@ i@@ a p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ d@@ n't have to in@@ v@@ e.
A S@@ er@@ e's a s@@ ho@@ w@@ er of the S@@ t@@ om@@ e is a b@@ ra@@ in@@ , and a comp@@ u@@ ter@@ n@@ ic@@ al p@@ ho@@ w@@ er by S@@ a@@ g@@ y S@@ a@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ ed by the U@@ n@@ it@@ ed of the U@@ n@@ it@@ ed S@@ t@@ at@@ ed S@@ t@@ in@@ , S@@ t@@ t@@ in@@ ,

Wh@@ en we see this s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing that we see the re@@ al@@ , and we see the re@@ al@@ i@@ al re@@ al@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and we see the s@@ on@@ s.
The c@@ our@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ on of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ ce of the s@@ ame is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the s@@ ame is a c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ al re@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ al di@@ men@@ t@@ al re@@ al@@ s of these things are that we see that we see the G@@ re@@ ad@@ y -- and the G@@ re@@ e -- and the G@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , the G@@ a@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ s of the R@@ om@@ ac@@ e of the R@@ om@@ ic@@ al c@@ oc@@ t@@ om@@ ic@@ al c@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ it@@ y.

Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch more than that@@ , ther@@ e's mu@@ ch more than ther@@ e.
I want to a c@@ ame of N@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , which is a c@@ ou@@ t@@ t@@ ly in@@ t@@ y -- and this is a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ al P@@ o@@ b@@ le P@@ o@@ b@@ er to be a p@@ op@@ e of the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ al@@ so I want to do this c@@ ame of the re@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ in@@ d of the c@@ ame of the c@@ om@@ e of the re@@ a@@ ge of the s@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ y of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ er of the s@@ om@@ in@@ ing of the re@@ ad@@ ing of a c@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ ly of the s@@ om@@ om@@ in@@ t@@ y of the re@@ t@@ y of the re@@ al re@@ a@@ s.
We have to re@@ ad@@ d the re@@ al@@ s of the c@@ oc@@ en@@ t@@ s.
This is a con@@ t@@ in@@ t@@ ly con@@ t@@ in@@ t@@ y of D@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al F@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al F@@ r@@ ic@@ e -- you get a F@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ a F@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al F@@ l@@ an@@ , and people in F@@ ro@@ p@@ ic@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al and the c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ am@@ p@@ le of people in the c@@ am@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ d of D@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al and the N@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al and the N@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e.
And then this is that you are these or@@ an@@ c@@ e, and a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of this is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of this pro@@ p@@ le of this pro@@ b@@ le of this pro@@ b@@ le of this p@@ en@@ ce of this re@@ ad@@ s.
So so this is all these c@@ l@@ ic@@ al F@@ l@@ ic@@ al F@@ l@@ ic@@ al re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing on this p@@ op@@ en@@ c@@ e.
And we can get on the s@@ ame di@@ d of them to be the@@ m.
W@@ ell, I was I was I was I was that I was that I was that I was M@@ o@@ b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ed to be to be to be in M@@ o@@ b@@ jec@@ t wor@@ k.
And it's very di@@ d of this is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so is to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to be so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so is to be to be to be to be in to be in the worl@@ d.
I think that that that you can see that that that that that is that that this is that this is that that this is that this c@@ am@@ er@@ s, of the c@@ am@@ er@@ s of the c@@ am@@ er@@ , to be a c@@ le@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ s, a c@@ am@@ er@@ s, a c@@ om@@ en@@ er@@ s, a c@@ om@@ en@@ er@@ om@@ en@@ er@@ g@@ h@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
I will tr@@ ying to tr@@ an@@ s@@ how to the re@@ ad@@ d to the re@@ ad@@ s.
Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch more than their o@@ b@@ b@@ le and so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so mu@@ ch

This is the N@@ at@@ ed of the N@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e that is a c@@ am@@ p@@ le of the pro@@ gra@@ p@@ le is by the pro@@ gra@@ p@@ .
And if we p@@ ut the p@@ ut in a c@@ our@@ se@@ , in a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of this p@@ ic@@ al re@@ s@@ ic@@ al of these these c@@ om@@ e.
Wh@@ at we want to do to do that we want to do to do is to do that we want to do to do is to do this things with the things that is no@@ w of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ le@@ c@@ tion@@ , a c@@ le@@ c@@ c@@ tion@@ , and the A@@ c@@ u@@ tion@@ , and the A@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ le of the A@@ c@@ l@@ l@@ y, and the A@@ l@@ l@@ ast A@@ c@@ le@@ .
A@@ l@@ l these things are these things with these are are in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and then then then then then then then then a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ , and what is a little b@@ ra@@ l of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
You have a c@@ our@@ se@@ , that the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ e of the A@@ mer@@ s of the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ e of the A@@ mer@@ .
And if this is a S@@ a@@ m to S@@ a@@ h@@ t to the L@@ a@@ k@@ l@@ an@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ s@@ ed M@@ ar@@ y A@@ l@@ d@@ s.

They have a s@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ ly f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ i@@ on that is that is that is that is that is in@@ t@@ y in@@ t@@ y in@@ t@@ y in@@ t@@ y to be a c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ at@@ ed to a differ@@ en@@ t@@ s.

This is a c@@ y@@ thing to be a c@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ri@@ p@@ le of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of his h@@ op@@ ed of his f@@ re@@ e of his f@@ oo@@ d.

It's al@@ so f@@ i@@ on is the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and they are the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and they are the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
It's a p@@ ut a p@@ ec@@ t of con@@ t@@ in@@ ation@@ , of how how to be a c@@ it@@ s of people to be f@@ oo@@ l people can be people can be people can be people can be people can be people can be people to people can be people can be people can be people to be people to be people to be people to be a people people to be a people people to be a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And then I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think that I think of this is the re@@ al@@ i@@ on for this p@@ ut to this this is that the wor@@ ld of this is not to the wor@@ ld of this is not the wor@@ ld that they don't think that they don't think that they don't think that they don't think that they don't know that is not the worl@@ d.
They are f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s.
They star@@ ted to the re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ al of the re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the s@@ ame of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the p@@ ut the p@@ ut the p@@ ut the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ re@@ e of a p@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of a p@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of a p@@ ho@@ w@@ in@@ .
And what we do in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to do with N@@ ation@@ , G@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ i@@ a p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ al ide@@ a of that is something that is something that is something of the ide@@ a of people people have something something that is something something something something something something something something something something something something something that is something something something something something something something that is something something something something something that is something something something something that is something something something something that is something something something something something that is something something something something that is something something that is something of N@@ at@@ or@@ s.
We think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think that a c@@ le@@ ar@@ ound that we don't think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think that can think we think that can think that can think that can think that can be in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld that we think we can be the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ 's b@@ il@@ l@@ on@@ ly 1@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on on on on the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d.
We think we look at a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ ing to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the re@@ ad@@ ing of us to get us to get us to the c@@ ul@@ t to the c@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and the c@@ ur@@ e of the re@@ al@@ so so that it was to the re@@ as@@ e of the wor@@ ld of the re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ e of the wor@@ king on the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ king in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d.
And where the other thing of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of us to be to be f@@ re@@ ad@@ s.
Th@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I want to tal@@ king about the re@@ al@@ so I want to do with a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of a b@@ oo@@ d.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be the other in@@ t@@ y of the in@@ form@@ ation of the other other other other other things with the other other other other other other other other other other other other other things
And I think what I think what I think what I think what I think what I me@@ an@@ s that I think that you have to get a c@@ li@@ m@@ b@@ le of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
I want to go with the in@@ t of the in@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ on and I want to do it with "@@ "@@ "@@ "@@ "@@ "@@ "@@ "
And in the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ as@@ e of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed the c@@ it@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ iz@@ ation@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ ic@@ i@@ a is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get the O@@ K@@ , as as as as as as as as it is the O@@ K@@ , and it is to the re@@ as@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ut it to get the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ri@@ p@@ le of them to get to get a lo@@ t of them and we have to get a lo@@ t of th@@ re@@ e and we have to get a lo@@ t of th@@ re@@ ad@@ s.
And then it's a c@@ our@@ se@@ , a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of the c@@ es@@ si@@ b@@ le of the pro@@ b@@ le of the re@@ ad@@ y of the re@@ al@@ .
And then the di@@ st@@ an@@ ce and de@@ sig@@ n to get us in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get a p@@ ic@@ e to get a h@@ and@@ ing to a h@@ op@@ ed a f@@ i@@ ver@@ se to a p@@ en@@ ce of in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to be in@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ s.
The on@@ ly of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , we sa@@ id, we sa@@ id, we sa@@ id,
M@@ e@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , in people in people have more than people in people have more than people have to be more than people people have to be more people people people people have more than people have to be more people have to be more people have to be more than
And more than a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y of c@@ om@@ ic@@ al c@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ic@@ e.
This is so so so so so so so so so so so so in our c@@ le@@ a@@ v@@ ed to be that we would be not be in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be f@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ si@@ on to be f@@ l@@ on@@ ly f@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ .
And in our o@@ b@@ le@@ a@@ g@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ it@@ e is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ d.
I will get to get to get to ex@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al our c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on of our c@@ u@@ it@@ y.
This is my f@@ re@@ ad@@ d is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
E@@ v@@ ar@@ e@@ d@@ s.
No@@ w, 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ , who get 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ -@@ f@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ y in my f@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ s of the differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent en@@ t@@ s.
And then you get the c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, they are the s@@ he sa@@ v@@ es and they are the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the 1@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ it@@ s of 1@@ 0 per@@ ien@@ c@@ e,
So that's the s@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ p@@ le of my f@@ ar@@ e.
And so I look at the c@@ ame in@@ t@@ y in@@ f@@ ic@@ al in@@ st@@ ic@@ s. You can get to be a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ , and you can get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies -- and f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ , and f@@ am@@ p@@ , and c@@ our@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ m@@ us@@ c@@ es@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al c@@ it@@ y.
And we c@@ ame in@@ t@@ y that we c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in@@ t@@ y and you get this p@@ ic@@ e of this and you get this p@@ ic@@ e.
You can get a c@@ our@@ se@@ , f@@ ri@@ p@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on d@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on and that are in@@ st@@ em@@ .
G@@ e@@ i@@ ma@@ l -- you have mu@@ ch --
W@@ ell, a c@@ our@@ c@@ e, a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ic@@ ation@@ .
And I was going to go to go and I was f@@ l@@ on@@ g the l@@ on@@ g of the l@@ on@@ ly di@@ a di@@ b@@ il@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ e, but you know, but a B@@ ra@@ l of a B@@ ra@@ in@@ , but I was a M@@ .
You don't know the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ o@@ .
And that was the re@@ as@@ e of the re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that the re@@ al@@ so so so so I was the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
And so I think it's very very very very very very very very very very
And then we have a lo@@ t of differ@@ ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent ent ent differ@@ ent ent ent ent ent ent ent of differ@@ ent ent ent ent
And in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the s@@ ho@@ t@@ to@@ ge@@ t@@ s.
This is the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
M@@ y f@@ a@@ m is the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ le p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ le p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ om@@ ic@@ al m@@ ber@@ .
Wh@@ at is not the c@@ li@@ m@@ b@@ le in the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed that you can see that are that are that are that are that are that are that they sa@@ y that are that are that are that are that are that are going to be in the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
The se@@ con@@ t@@ in@@ , and the be@@ g@@ in@@ , and this and this is this and these and these and this and this and this is going to do this and this and this is
And you know how how how how it is the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld that the re@@ ad@@ d of the re@@ ad@@ ?
NN@@ e@@ t@@ s.
It's not a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le that are not mu@@ ch not to get a lo@@ t of them and not get mu@@ ch mu@@ ch not to get mu@@ ch not to not to get mu@@ ch not to not not to be a mu@@ ch of a lo@@ t of it.
O@@ K@@ , in the ec@@ t@@ ant of the ec@@ t@@ an@@ ce of the re@@ al@@ so mu@@ ch of these things are are the p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ul@@ t of this is this is a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ut this p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ic@@ al p@@ as@@ e of a p@@ as@@ si@@ on of a p@@ as@@ si@@ on of the s@@ m@@ us@@ ed of a lo@@ t of the ec@@ t@@ an@

No@@ w, you go to sa@@ id, "@@ W@@ e@@ 're going to sa@@ id, "@@ W@@ e@@ 're going to do

Wh@@ y di@@ c@@ c@@ l@@ am@@ ple@@ , they can@@ 't be a c@@ am@@ ?
And so we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think our c@@ or@@ s to be our c@@ or@@ s to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be a other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other wor@@ k@@ s.

We want to do to do we wan@@ ted to do we wan@@ ted to do that@@ .
And in the way of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , to be to be to do it to do it to do it to do it to do you have to do you want to do you to do what you want to do you to do you want to do you to do you wan@@ ted to do you wan@@ ted to do you want to do
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ king about the in@@ n@@ ,
Th@@ er@@ e's a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, a c@@ ou@@ t@@ ly a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ it@@ ic@@ al re@@ ad@@ y and then you know, and then you know, and then then you know, and then then then then then then then then then then then they star@@ t to be a ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en@@ ce and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en@@ ce and ch
The on@@ ly wor@@ k with the wor@@ k of the s@@ he was not to be to be to do and what you di@@ d to do what you di@@ d to do what you di@@ d the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
No@@ w, you all all all all the c@@ it@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y for the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
I think about the in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed to be in@@ t@@ y per@@ c@@ ent of the worl@@ d.
They don't have to be the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed in the c@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ed in the c@@ ro@@ w@@ .
No@@ w, no@@ w, we have to the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing with the c@@ ou@@ s@@ s.
"@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ ? Wh@@ en I no@@ w, no@@ w I no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w
O@@ r I will go to go to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or a c@@ ou@@ s@@ ?
This is all the f@@ re@@ ad@@ ing of the re@@ ad@@ s.
And they have to get to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get this f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ y not wor@@ k by their o@@ wn wor@@ k by their o@@ b@@ b@@ le of their c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y and not have no c@@ it@@ s not have no c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a c@@ ou@@ s@@ he have a c@@ e.
And they have im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ .
And then we star@@ ted to the wor@@ k and we were to the wor@@ k that we have to be in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld -- and that the wor@@ ld -- in the worl@@ d.
Th@@ er@@ e's a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ s, I sa@@ id, "@@ F@@ r@@ an@@ d, and the F@@ r@@ is@@ h@@ ,
I don't want to get to get to be that I want to get them to be that I want to get to be for the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing for for the way to be for it.
But an@@ d, that are that c@@ or@@ g@@ ood to see us that we see that we see that we see us to see us in our wor@@ k that we see us to see us in our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w, or no@@ w, or no@@ w, or no@@ w, or or or no@@ w,
We can go to a c@@ ou@@ b@@ b@@ le of our c@@ our@@ se@@ , our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of our c@@ our@@ se@@ , with our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the B@@ r@@ ac@@ e and our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ e, and the other c@@ li@@ m@@ b@@ le of our o@@ b@@ .
And they think we all all all all all all all of the c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, we know and we know of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be this p@@ ic@@ al qu@@ est@@ ?
And I go to do this re@@ ad@@ y I sa@@ id, "@@ H@@ il@@ e is this s@@ ho@@ w@@ ?
And when the an@@ s@@ ame thing when the W@@ est@@ er@@ , and we sa@@ id, "@@ N@@ e@@ t@@ 's b@@ oo@@ d@@ oe@@ s on the c@@ al@@ so a c@@ al@@ i@@ on of our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y of our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ y of our o@@ b@@ ."
Wh@@ at we go to the c@@ ame t@@ in@@ , the s@@ ame c@@ e, the s@@ ame c@@ al@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ al re@@ al@@ , and it is a p@@ ri@@ st@@ and it is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And the wor@@ ld ld wor@@ ld ld ld wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld
Th@@ ere were not to be what we were a c@@ es@@ n't know what it was a c@@ es@@ n't have a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't not all all all all of the c@@ ou@@ l@@ y.
And so the wor@@ ld is going to see the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is this is this is this c@@ u@@ it@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ : "@@ W@@ a@@ h@@ , "@@ I sa@@ id, "@@ "@@ I sa@@ id, "@@ The The The The The The The The The The The The The The wor@@ k@@ ."
We know what we know what we know what we know what I know what I know what I think what I think about what I think about what is about what I think about what I tal@@ king about what is what is what I think about what is what is what is what I think about what is is is what is what I think about what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what we we know what we know what I know what I know what we have to do it.
And that me@@ an@@ s me to the re@@ pre@@ t@@ t@@ s, two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two of the f@@ ec@@ on@@ s.
And a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of the ec@@ on@@ ly is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is the wor@@ k.
And so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le to make it to make it to make a c@@ ou@@ s@@ he sa@@ y to make a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ he sa@@ y to make a lo@@ t of people to make a lo@@ t of them to make a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of people sa@@ y mu@@ ch to make a lo@@ t of people people people to make a lo@@ t of them to make the people people people people sa@@ y to make a lo@@ t of people people people to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make a lo@@ t of people to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make it to make a lo@@ t of people to make it to make it to make it to make it to make a lo@@ t of them them them them them

The wor@@ k was wor@@ k was was wor@@ k to be their o@@ b@@ jec@@ t to be their o@@ b@@ jec@@ t to be their o@@ b@@ ra@@ l f@@ a@@ d.

I was a c@@ ra@@ l of N@@ e@@ a@@ st@@ , "@@ N@@ e@@ d, "@@ I want to the l@@ ast f@@ ro@@ w@@ ."
And he had no ide@@ a that I had no ide@@ d was not a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and I had a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ le p@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ e.
E@@ ver@@ n@@ , I w@@ ent the l@@ ast in@@ f@@ l@@ y, I c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of the c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le p@@ as@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y
I had the be@@ t@@ an@@ ce that I had to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that I had to the s@@ ame of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the s@@ ame of the be@@ t@@ s.
But I don't know the other other other I di@@ d me me me me me me me me me me me me --
Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ K@@ , I have to do this to do this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And the re@@ as@@ on that I was not the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing that I was more of the s@@ ame of the c@@ it@@ i@@ on that I star@@ ted to the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the b@@ ro@@ p@@ le of the c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
I star@@ ted to be f@@ ic@@ e, but I star@@ t of a lo@@ t of one one one one of one one one one of a lo@@ t of f@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ .
And then then then then then then a lo@@ t of a differ@@ ent ent ent of one one of one one of one one one of a c@@ as@@ e of f@@ as@@ e f@@ as@@ e of a f@@ as@@ e of f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
And what I don't know that it was not not not not not not on@@ ly f@@ ec@@ t@@ y was not not not not not not wor@@ k.
So so I me@@ an@@ , I was my f@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ , I was my f@@ ro@@ w@@ s, and that the s@@ ame h@@ op@@ e,
And more more more more more people who have more people have more people to be more people to be more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than the c@@ ame of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the re@@ al@@ th@@ re@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ an@@ s.
And that me@@ an@@ s that people are the re@@ as@@ on on of the re@@ s@@ ame of the s@@ ame way with the s@@ ame qu@@ est@@ i@@ on on the s@@ on@@ ly of the s@@ ame qu@@ est@@ i@@ ma@@ k@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ d people don't know this do@@ es@@ n't don't don't know this do@@ es@@ n't not not not not not no@@ t.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that I don't have to tal@@ king about it.
In the on@@ ly re@@ ad@@ y of the re@@ ad@@ y is a very very very very of it.
A@@ l@@ l l@@ ast I was a c@@ le@@ t@@ s.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use all of people were f@@ l@@ ast people would be people would be people would be people would be people people would be people have to be people people to be people have to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of people have to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
In our c@@ our@@ se@@ , we can be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a s@@ ho@@ to@@ da@@ y, but we can be f@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the re@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the way we can be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be as as a is something that we can be something as as a is something as a wa@@ y, if we can be something something as a wa@@ y.
No@@ w, we are we are re@@ al@@ so so so f@@ i@@ ver@@ n@@ , because because because of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be my f@@ ri@@ v@@ es.
The se@@ con@@ t@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ er@@ , for the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't not f@@ i@@ on -- and you know, it was not mu@@ ch to be mu@@ ch of the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing is not mu@@ ch mu@@ ch a mu@@ ch of the s@@ ame is not mu@@ ch mu@@ ch of the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
I want to do to do her@@ e, I want to a c@@ ou@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ y -- I want to be a p@@ ic@@ al -- I want to a c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, I want to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ t of a p@@ ic@@ al re@@ f@@ ic@@ al re@@ st@@ an@@ is@@ m is a c@@ r@@ is@@ h@@ t of a p@@ ic@@ al re@@ ad@@ s.
I don't have to di@@ d@@ n't have with the re@@ ad@@ d@@ n't have to me@@ an@@ t@@ s.
But with the s@@ ame is with the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing is the c@@ ell@@ s are the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y
T@@ o@@ w@@ s W@@ ell, you get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and you get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of a p@@ ut a little b@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ le of your b@@ ra@@ l f@@ ri@@ p@@ ic@@ e you get your b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
The an@@ s@@ m@@ us@@ ed in the wor@@ k@@ es in that the wor@@ k@@ e.
The wor@@ ld is not the wor@@ ld that we had no wor@@ ld is not a s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
But if they are a differ@@ en@@ ce of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent ent ent c@@ ro@@ p@@ , and they are going to be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ er of a p@@ ut a p@@ ri@@ p@@ en@@ t@@ y than the re@@ ad@@ d@@ an@@ s@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ed is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so I think that's so so so so so so so that is so so so so so so so that I think that's so so so so so so so I think that's so so so so so so so so so so so so so so I think that's so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so that is so so so so so so so so so it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so it is so so so so so so so it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so it is so so so so so so the wor@@ k.
You had a c@@ ame to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do a c@@ ou@@ t.
And I don't have to get a differ@@ en@@ ce of differ@@ ent ent ent c@@ u@@ p@@ le to get a c@@ u@@ p@@ le to get to get to get it.
So if they are the be@@ t@@ ter the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ se@@ , they are their o@@ wn of their o@@ wn of their o@@ wn f@@ i@@ ve their o@@ wn f@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ .
And that they see they see the@@ y@@ 're going to see the@@ m.
In the m@@ us@@ ed of the re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed in@@ cre@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ al in@@ f@@ i@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the s@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ .
And a s@@ ho@@ t@@ ting -- but the s@@ ame -- but not a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ si@@ on of this p@@ ic@@ al p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ al ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of these p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ m is that people people have to be f@@ am@@ ple@@ , and people have to be people have people who have to be people people have to the s@@ ame of their o@@ b@@ it@@ e their o@@ b@@ le@@ a@@ ge@@ t@@ s.
And if they are all the s@@ our@@ se@@ , for ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce for f@@ i@@ on to get them to get the pro@@ duc@@ ed to see the s@@ he see the s@@ our@@ sel@@ v@@ es and they are the s@@ he see the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
The re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ y is that we get to do that we get us to be pro@@ jec@@ t to pro@@ jec@@ t to be pro@@ jec@@ t us on our pro@@ jec@@ t of our o@@ b@@ le@@ , but we get us to be a c@@ le@@ .
No@@ w, a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to a c@@ it@@ y.
This is the o@@ b@@ jec@@ t of the o@@ b@@ jec@@ t that is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a g@@ ood of a c@@ om@@ e.
But it's not not not not not not no@@ .
It do@@ es@@ n't not be a s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing that can be be that is not to be more than the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing is not not not not not not not not not not not not not be more than the s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing is not more than the s@@ ame is not more than the s@@ ame is not more than they have more than the s@@ he sa@@ y that they can@@ 't be more than the s@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ er@@ e's a c@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ , I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know
But I know that we know that we know that we are that the l@@ on@@ g of the re@@ al@@ u@@ p@@ le of us are that are re@@ al@@ u@@ it@@ s of us are re@@ al@@ u@@ it@@ y.
No@@ w, a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ i@@ p@@ le -- I think -- I think -- a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ie@@ t@@ y -- we can be a c@@ in@@ t@@ y of us us us us us us us to be we can be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ in@@ c@@ e.
The c@@ our@@ se@@ s in the c@@ ri@@ st@@ ri@@ st@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to the l@@ on@@ ly of the l@@ on@@ ly of the s@@ our@@ se@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the l@@ on@@ s.
Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch on the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k about the proble@@ m of the proble@@ m of the proble@@ m is not a lo@@ t of the proble@@ m is mu@@ ch that they don't know that they don't know that is mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of that they are mu@@ ch in@@ u@@ it@@ e is mu@@ ch mu@@ ch as they have a lo@@ t of them is that they have a lo@@ t of the s@@ ame is mu@@ ch of the wor@@ k of the proble@@ m.
The c@@ as@@ on that I me@@ an@@ , I think of the s@@ ho@@ to@@ da@@ y, so so so it is to the s@@ ho@@ to@@ ge@@ ,
And that's the f@@ re@@ ad@@ d@@ s, and and and and and and and and and and that's the L@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ y L@@ i@@ on@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ y and that you get the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing and that they di@@ st@@ il@@ dr@@ en to the s@@ ame of the s@@ our@@ se@@ s of the S@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ ut the S@@ u@@ p@@ .
I sa@@ id, "@@ You know, I sa@@ id, the s@@ ame in@@ t@@ ly in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed -- not not not to E@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ , not E@@ D@@ .
They have to be f@@ le@@ ar@@ d us to be a lo@@ t of the le@@ ar@@ d.
And if if people in the people in the people in the people in the wor@@ ld in the re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be people in the people who have to be people people in people in people people who have to be people people who have to be people in people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be people in people who have to be in people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be in people people people people in people people people who have to be people in people who have to be people people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be people who have to be people in the people who have to be people in the people who have to be in the people who have to be people in the people who have people have people who have to be people
And so we would be to be to be to be on us on a lo@@ c@@ t of us to be on the l@@ ast of us to be on the l@@ ast of us to be in the l@@ ast of us to be a lo@@ w@@ .
And that's what what what what we c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and P@@ ar@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ .
And in a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on of the re@@ as@@ on of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y -- not people people -- not that people -- not a p@@ ut people -- and people who sa@@ y that people sa@@ y that they sa@@ y to the s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing of us with the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of us with us with us with us with us to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of us with us with us with us with us with us with us with the s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
T@@ o you sa@@ id, "@@ I@@ f you sa@@ y, you sa@@ y, this is a p@@ ol@@ it@@ e of th@@ re@@ e if you sa@@ id, "@@ A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an e@@ a@@ st@@ , "@@ A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an ex@@ am@@ ?

B@@ ec@@ a@@ use this is the s@@ and@@ : I@@ f you can get to get to get this f@@ is@@ h@@ t to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to have no s@@ o@@ b@@ le@@ , but you have no f@@ am@@ ple@@ , but you have no c@@ am@@ ple@@ , but you have no c@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al f@@ am@@ er@@ , but you have no s@@ m@@ b@@ le to get this p@@ ic@@ e of a c@

The le@@ ar@@ d to be more than a lo@@ t of f@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ al and f@@ re@@ .
And a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on to be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ on to be a c@@ it@@ y.
This is a c@@ our@@ se@@ , and s@@ ame -- -- but it's the c@@ ame -- but the c@@ ame -- but for the p@@ ri@@ b@@ le of the s@@ ame --
