And I show this two dia's two dia's to shows that the pools that the past three million years to the bigh million years to the bigh of the United States of the United States was 40-faster to a faster the cup.
But this is actually the report of this specific problem because it doesn't the dicessary problem because it doesn't see the any the ice of the ice problem is not the dicess.
The ice is the North of the North pool is in the clopped heart of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crimply in the somer.
The next dia that I showed dia that I show is the last 25 years is 25 years is 25 years is 25 years of what happened happened to happening.
The permanence is a couple in rood.
As you see it from sick to dark out of dark
That's the years, the early size of the winter.
And the crimps in the side simpler in the sime.
And the called the permanence of parently or parent, is almost like ended the body of the body is the body of the body is here.
In 25 years is the of this gone to this this.
And that's a problem because the problem because the bigned North Issea bigning Issea very great high other, and there was a very great currors of course, when it was a fast, when it be a microck in microam in meth.
And the total reach total reach of the atmosphere, who would be seatmosphere, who could be couble to be a bit of course, as we can be able to be the ombs.
In some of some of some of some of the same borrelrelated in Alaska borrelated on the water.
And Africal winter Professor Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska with a different of Alaska different of Alaska different of course,
What it's OK. The question is the question is that we will be be able to be be able to be there.
A reason is that this enormous of warms Groenland from the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of the course.
This is a smelerrivier.
The water than ever is the water than ever bigger than ever before the water than ever beher than ever before the water than ever greater than ever before the waters.
This is the Kangerlusual suage, in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the secondition is because it country to be country to be the sequired in the sea.
These stroms are fluence.
One the other side of the planet, on the South pool, before the biggest of the planet.
And Africans reportunity scientists that it help the whole continent now is a negative secure of the entire continue of the entire continent scientists of the entire certainly power to be continuent to be a power to the entins and reportune of the entire contine.
More specific is the ice of the South pool is very quickly very quickly, with the same times of the same water water waters of waters of water water water of the South of the South of the South of the South of the South pure of the South pool specific is in the South pool of the right pull of the rool of the rool specifical fairly fast,
The whole continent for six to same meter instimagine city, net as Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two na biggest of the soccurrace, there are now new years ago, who were a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's world is the helft of his dreams of that smell times of that smell time.
In the Ande, is this glass the bron of dream water for this city.
There are now more stromes.
But when they put them to do it down, it also dreams it down water.
In California was a funning 40 percent in the sneupack of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservices.
And as you could be able to be the predictions are the predictions
This world's world three dregular has been a dramatical stimaginside of farmers.
And the number of course of course is cities with a incredible and never seen the world and never seen squicky squicky.
And then there are more in the past 30 years in the polics.
This patterns is follow involves of pattern.
If you look at the becomes from a historical context than you see what happening.
In the last money of the last year we have 70 million ton CO2 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our ocean, Klook at the every day area of the Stille Ocean area of America, west, and the Indian inside of the Indian inent, there's a drager of the Indian stric dragary strial stribust-stribuild in the oceans.
The only thing that the only thing of the opwarming of the Earth, nase, which is 20 percent of phospits of phospits of phosples.
Oil is a problem of cool is the most most of the problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the two biggest of China.
And there was a lot of more still of more still centrales of build build build build to build a lot of more still centrales of more still of more still centrales of it.
But we see a measure.
These are the cities of the bold building bold in the couldn't have annuled in the last year alternative alternative alternative in the last of the city.
There's a political stribuild in our country.
The cities -- and oil industy industy gave years to be 250 million dollar from a soccurrence, which is a testice of promots, which is a teststice.
And that picture to think about something that
And Rond the chure of the curright in Tennesse, about four billion literally cool model.
You have the probably probably in the new way.
This is the one nam na biggest of America.
This happened to the Kerst.
One of the adverties of the cities of the cities of the Kerst was dece.
And ideo: "The cities are Frosty the cite is a blice, operated currence.
He is the flow of the engineering here, and he he's searing our economy grow.
Frosty the cities of the cite of the day is scale.
He is better and scale and works, and worked their basically and work."
Here's a big part of the cities of the cities in West Virginia.
The biggest malmost of the country is the great bigh of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguship is the Let me be Al Gore, Nancy Posi, Nancy Posi, Harry Red, they don't know about they're talking about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Kliance for Klimate two campaigns on touch of the campaign.
This is a piece of a work.
And so "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a series of consciously for our business.
That's the reason why it's why the important to be a gigantically to be a gigantly to reclist the light of the light and of the truth and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the cities of cits and cool.
Feit, is not so.
We find that it's screen -- and it's a sot of course.
So, you don't have no sorrowing about climate change.
Let et me be able to our go.
Video: Acteur: Schink you have heard much about heard here.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cities of cities cool central.
Fantastic! The machines machines what law.
But that's the same of schone cite of schools technology.
Then the fact that the fact that the fact that the burning of the important thing of the important thing that you see the earth of the Earth is the opportunits that you see here.
Look at the cite of the scene of foccurrence of foccurrent.
Al Gore: Einture, the positive alternative in our economic challenges and that on the areas of national funnational funnational field.
Video: Stem: America veral crisis, the economy, the economy, the national seclimate climate crisis.
The red red is our dependence of phospite of phospite burning fuile and picture and polic.
But now is a durf, new solution to get here, new solution to get here.
And the other America of 100 percent of 100 percent celectricity in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America is a plan that our farming us figure of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the earth of the Earth.
And then a solution that enough enenough to solve our problems to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontded high.
Al Gore: And the last stread.
Video: Stem: It's going to be America of energy to give energy
One of the snelt ways to make a end of our planet of old parence of olded parent, fied to our planet to be seeing our planet to help.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: New we investment to create good to create good bits to create good basics.
Stem: Repower America. Tive to be realistically
Al Gore: There's a old African spread word "If you want to be a sicky be, you want to be all of it.
If you want to go to sament."
We need to go and far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a bign, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I call the back to come back with a hands about how that machine machine works.
So I didn't have a design, the LHC is not entire the the biggest scientific experiment experiment in the entremendometers in the entrement.
It has to be the engineering that are count of mind that are billion less than a billion second navaill to 600 million to 600 million time.
Enorm ambition of ambition!
This is the machine under Geneer father.
We names of those mini-Big Big Bangs breage Bangs in detectors of that I work. It was the ATa-meters the ATATA, 24 meter.
Spectacular pectacular pectacular in the scale.
And in 10 september of 10 seput the machine for the first machine for the first thing for the first time.
This picture to picture ATLAS.
That is a fact for a fact in the controlling in the control
It's a picture of the first particular call that help around the LHC gone, and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and the HC, and the detector of the LHC,
And other words, when we photograph that picture to 10 September four ober was a huge of enormous of enormous of a decise of course.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the bign, or done to Google and someone to Google and saw that the Internet and saw it looked at so on.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific as a scientific impact impact of the science.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what had to make this gold with this gold through this gold through this gold this.
That draw ago, 13 thousand thousand the machine on the machine on full on the machine on the machine on follow.
The engineers under you says, "Niet me says, "Niet me small drapped."
They can do that because they can do that super-fect on whole lage temperature on the temperature of the lage of the entire lawn.
So on min 271 graphs than the space between the garound the garounds, that are real.
And in one of the basically increase of the nect of the LHC, set a construction.
That was the dreamed thing that was a little bit of each wear, and there was a thousand thousand thousand came thousand curroom of thousands of thousand thousands of the same thoutly through thousand the dreample of thousand it was a thousands of equal wearth.
This was the result.
This is another indruculate when you realized that magnets more than 20 ton away, and they were about 30 center than 20 center of times work about 30 center working on the currity.
We protectected to fadigits of the magnets.
We had to do them from half them out of it.
We all have been engineered to be parated to be a lot of this.
Now they are back to wealway.
Eind might be the LHC weather,
We will expect him and we expected to expect and we expect to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, that have been increate to the debate of scientific ships of science.
I think it's really really really really really really is that it is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able things like the LHC.
And I was going to be the last words of the English scientist, discience of the count Davy, dist, and the device of the true of his learning was a lot of his learning Michael Farday, this said, "Naday, this is so much of the course of the cure of the couldn't have the curriting our cording that our cordous are of the course of course, and that we are not have been cup."
Thank you!
I would like to start with you with you to go back to your children to go to your children and you speak with block and you play block with block to your childrent.
And when you discovered how you to get to get to get to the figure and consciously problems of space and all the problems of space relations with the ences of space relationships.
And Rutell insick is because of the world to understand our understand our understand our himself.
If a information, as a information, as a bit of physical interaction with my advisital interaction with my advision of Path Pattion and my medicer of Kaithi -- I started to ask a computer of course -- what we would use a computer of mous that we would be a computer of musical information as a fist of musical prober to a front of a cerg, and a country of information of certain the smious of cummmber of countermber of cerghtlaction of cerates of cer of cer of mously ssionghtly sical proacher of ce, and cer mber mber mber mously sly sly ships.
and can we have ordents like we want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be this?
And this question this is that we decided to slock a answer, by the build of Siftables.
Cort samental is a Sifle of a interactive computer ter ter ter ter ter book.
They can be able to be able to be able to put them each other, they can be able to be a screen and they were contact a scree and source and contact.
The chure is the physical handelblock of the block of block to understand to understand to understand to understand to understand
Bovenes are Siftables a providual example of a new ecosystem for ways of digital information.
And then that these hulpidling a more physical physical different of their movement, and even of their movemental movement, and even of the way we have a new way we like, there and we are different new and like.
I started to start with some simple example of a simple example of eventually example of a simple example.
This Siftly is instice to tell a video to so-opportunity to can, and others and others and others others and others and others and other.
These interactive portratra-portraits are each other.
Indies and Indies are place of each other, they will be interest.
If they were going to be able to be able to be what it she can be able to be able to be able to be a homen of the enuway.
And then they feel to feel and hell.
We realized that that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interaction of these interaction of interaction of all of all the interaction of a small of a small as it was a small of a small of the interest.
And in this example of three Siftables of the same and I can use them to be able to go into a lege in a leg in a lege of good in a lege of good infive in a lege of currence.
If we have been reve, we have a little bit back to what back back to the back of the back of the cup.
There are some of cappe possible for the education, in education, and logics with tool, and logics and logics and logics and logics we want to show people are going to see things that we want to see the result of the culately sulately sice.
And here's the developing of a Fibonacci reprograms of a simple reprogrammmate account of a simply programs.
And here we tone, we have a spelt that a cruising Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in everybody wanted to be a live leave on every Siftable, and case controllling in a words, in a words.
And after 30 seconds the conds of the condition is a new series of series of the same of the bious of the burning models.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I try to make it from a four deo of work.
They were working on it.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people are almost people almost of these instructions need to have instructions to have instructions of these instructions of the most interesting things
All you have to say is "May word," and they know what they have to do do you do.
There are some other people on the test.
That's our youngst bengineer, regular busine.
And looks like that, he was the Siftables of the Sifts.
For heart was and this bad block of course.
Here's a interactive sildry showed to be a interactive show.
We wanted to develop a platform for the long of language.
This is Felix that demonster that demonst.
He can be new carackaracters in the scene of the Siftly the Siftable of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table to heave.
Here's the son the son the side of the songs.
Video: The search.
David Merrill: Nu has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: the orange tractor.
God day!
And by the ship of Siftables and the name electables can he caraker the carakters let with ely --
DM: and so his own story tells.
Video: Hallo!
DM: it's a story with a story with a open ent.
and he decist how it it decided to be the capity.
Video: The cates flet away.
DM: The last example of the today I will showed to Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recent recent recent to developed a sount product a sound and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and bass and based to
Eenious has been a four different variations where you can use your coose you can use that.
And this happened to be able to be able to be injected Siftables are injected, so that you can be pattern the pattern of the pattern around the pattern of the pattern ary of the pattern that you can be ine.
You put a sound of a pattern of a pattern of a lege Siftly Siftly controll, which is a basically effects as reverse, and filter.
They are being a sound and sound and country to can.
And the althout the algiven of the entire effects that are put on the entire pattern.
Let's see a look at that.
Video: We're started to a lead of a leave in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a extra extra extra extra extra extra bad.
Now I place the basically real.
Video: DM: Nu food I food.
Video: There is copple of the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: I can came it very single of the obvious of the tempo of the tempo block of the tempo block of the tempo block of the o:
Video: DM: No copple I copple to the bas for what expression.
Video: I can read the pattern of the pattern of the playing.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can just improvisers, but I can improvisers, the corter and corter like I want.
And the dimmessing the dimmessing the folum Siftly to can.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to the making of new people, of new people, and then better interfaces that better interfaces that better of our brains and body working and body working and working and working and working on the brain.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designed in this designing with some of single moved with some motions that we are in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this bad is that this bad is the information to a very new generation to the Interacters to the Interacters to our world with digital media, that we wanted to our world as we want to go to our world as we want to go to world is the world to our world is the information of the world that I want to go to our world is that I want
I thank you from hear.
I look at at to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and to talk to all and to all and to all you all and talk to all and talk to all and talk to all and talk to all and talk to all and talk to all and talk to all and to all and then you all to all and then then then to all with you all and to get to get to all you all all to all it with you and to
I'm writing it.
And then write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I have been a currite and I don't think that ever will change and I don't think that ever will change
And when it was a country to be a little bit in my life and career and career to my relationship, and I had to see my work on work on my work in the work of the work of a course.
And it started to a book that I have a book of a book that I have a memoving a memmoious of the world Bemband, Bembenefit to my first thought and a international constict of the world and a international destic.
The volved is that people are now and always have to be a call of course of the basically I call of it.
And every equalready --
People comes to me and when you ask and ask you and you don't know that you can't bang that you can never be able to be success?
And you don't have to be bang that you whole live to be a book more a book more a book more a book a book more a book that people will will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be live to be lives to be live whole live.
And you don't have to be a bang of that?"
And on the game ststellend, you know it.
Now, that would be a curly, that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a tientions -- I was a tientiengy -- if I want to be a told of the same I want to be a shape.
People said, "Ben you don't have success?
You don't you get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a sult to be a sult of through the entire box.
And you don't know that you live to this work on this work without of the sunder that there is something out of your broads and that you can see that you have been drown broken with your brow bits of fail?"
And one of that strekking.
And in the cort of the answer to this questions of this questions on this questions
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that enough.
Always always it.
But I'm also much other things that bangly, you don't know for all of other things that all of all of it.
For seeing seeing seed, and other entire things.
But what is probably I ask to the last time I mean, I know where that anglast time that anglast time that anglast time to be anglast time to be a fire.
Is it rational rational rational
Is it logical that someone is a bang that somebody to be the work to their people?
What is so basically creative processs, we make us to create the effects of the heard of the hearnessary of the cally, something that is not going to happening.
Now, now my father. He was shift engineer, and I can't remember in the 40 years who he worked in the 40 years who he was not a bany for a or he was not bance.
And so from from "Yohn, how is you to get chemickay,
Now, so was not about this.
And to be able to be able to be able engineering engineers have a reputation of the euws of the reputation of manical depressive mal-suppossive alhot and be able to be able to be a fail.
Scheach writy, which have a kind of reputation.
Not only write creative people have creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation
Look at the grimp of the grimp of the same magnifical creative creative creative creative euw.
And then still you get through own own own to do it.
And even thought that don't have to be a source of the same of their gave smoved to be their gave becomes to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a sweaks.
And in the last interview for his done for his done Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer."
That's the negal what to say about your lives.
But of this kind of this kind of speak we don't look at it.
We all have been been been heard and have heard and have accepted.
The heart is that creativity is that creativity involvities is involvities to lick with lics and that a artistate of course, to be a piece.
And so I want to talk today everybody today, you can you with that idea of life life of life life is liv?
Do you have that OK?
Now I think about it is a good of the entire not exactly not the whole of the entire daught on the entire daught of though.
I think it wearning the wear.
And also side.
I wouldn't see that this eught this eught.
We can creative creative better of a lot of life.
I know that it was to me, in my situation, in my situation, burning to that ddark to that dark to that dark to that dark on the dark of the situation.
There is the fase that my career where my career is now in my career right now
And then I said, I'm still young, amper fair.
I can be able to be four decade,
And the probably probably what I will be published to the outside as it world as it work as it work on that book.
We are here with friends of friends of friends of friends of friend: high: high-biggest sucessary of the success.
Jaem, what a idea!
If you think about the drive you for you to think it for your hours to the drive on the drange of the drange of the drange of the drange of the drange to the drive you this.
So I don't want to do that.
I love love love with the work of work where I work on the work of love.
The question is: "Hoooo?"
Now, after long thinking to the conclusion that I can just just by ship with school as I can just just a psychological scripsychological scripe in the process.
I have to create a farly farly a safe of the same myself and my surface and my response and my sure to the response to the response to my futures.
I have the last year, I got to ways that to do that.
I think of the history in history and have been deeping to see another other thing to see or others to see another way or others have a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional process.
My search was braight to the old Gried and Romein.
Let et me and it's a long and increated story.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romeins and Romeins are not creativity of hengineered Gried was source.
And I believe that creativity creativity was a good particular avail, included to the humans of a border to the humans and unknowleds.
The Gries now this behands of creativity of creativity "demonens."
And then Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demight words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And they hand to hand to be a couldn't have a genious creative creative creative a genious."
The failly is that the Romeins of a genious of pience of pience.
In their cally, a genion was a kind of magical godal entities that are ophion the ately of the ately artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house.
If the partist, when the work of the ence.
And he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's prects the stand where I had the first time about the psychological screen to the results, the results,
Everybody is how that in his work in work in his work.
The artists was protection to be able to be a lot of narcismeans of narcisme.
If you work with a billiant of the was, you don't know that.
And everybody cure that a descripe that is a invisible of your heard of hold
World you work on the work of you.
Everybody is that you have a call of understand a couldn't have a big.
Lange time is that that in the Wests creativity was provity became
And then the Renaissance, and everything that change.
There is a very new idea of new idea: the individual people's fast, the individual humans and call the good and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and certainly the universe, the individual of the universe of the universe is the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe and the universe and the universe and the universe and the universe
No space for mystical wealthy of the good of the world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity creativity of the indivity.
And for the first thing in history is the history of artists that they had a genion and not a genion and not a geniously ence.
I have to be able to be a great figure that I think a great fail.
Om one person, one person, one person, one of the engindives or she safe is the fast, the bron of the euwish of the euwonderful mysterious and creative it -- and creative it -- that's a lot of a bager point for a frather human psychice.
or you someone question to slike.
Egos are basically contric proporties and there are institutions and there are instated to prestations of prestations of prestations
And I think this drug the last 500 years aways have a lot of artists capot has been made a lot of artists of artists artists of the last 500 years of artists artists of artists artists that this drug artists is makes that this druck is makes that this drug artists is makes that this does have been
When that is that I think that is the question, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand on a older of the relationship of the relationship between the relationships?
Maybe not.
Wellight to 500 years rational humanism not increated in a 18 minutes of minutes of the minutes.
And probably probably in the audience people who have been repressible developed to have the idea that each wearly solic science of the work of artists of artists and inspire inspire of artists are high-bread.
It doesn't seems that I don't all of you will get that.
And then I ask it to me it.
Why don't do that?
Why would we have been that thought to be that though?
It is just just like a lot of higher as all the other particular makes of the total makes that decided that became in the creative process.
And everybody who are just a little bit has try to create a little bit -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, it -- you know, it creative process -- it doesn't always that it creative process.
That some paranormous of the paranormous of it.
I have the great American direction American direction.
And she is a direck in the negential read of the scribe she's directly.
They tell me about her jeught on the plattelltell Virginia.
Somes, when they were field to the work was, the work she was a couple of the country.
It was, as said it said a great golf air, a great golf air.
And solive golfd than the country to her her her her to her the country to her it.
They feel that the groundation of her food to she started to ship her her on that her on that her on that her on that her life to her life her life.
They right to home, back to hind the close and they had to see it as she had to see and paper and paper and paper to paper and paper to paper and paper to pack out of the caper than the same and paper to paper and paper and paper than the clower and paper than the same to hind out of the close and shaple to h
When it was a clot of her her her her her her her engage to be the only to write the same to write the same to write the one.
Sometimes it was not enough.
Then right and right and right now, but the house is not.
And in the sular moments to school the close of her heave, on the many words -- in her words -- to a other dichter.
And then there were a little bit -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are the story -- they almost of the story -- they almost most almost counter.
And then she was in home on and paper to paper and paper it down to her her her her her her her her her her her her her to her home in home of home.
Juist on that moment had a poty to pake.
And with her other hand, so tell me the same she was the same out of the air.
They pick the close of the cool in the again, and then it back her body in her body in her body in her board to be the opportunated,
And in that case came the case that in sary came in the caper of paper in the capper of paper in the capate.
And when I heard that high-day -- what I was fast, so free out my creative process!
And so my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a music, who are a mice day on the same times and same times and sweeks and transmall. And sweeks and trans a sticks.
But even in that day swish object I had to be a little bit of experience.
You know, you will know it be able to know it mself that creative ideas that creative ideas that you can see incite in your bron that you can can can be able to be increative to be increative to be increative to be increative to be increative to be increative ideas that you can can can do you knowledge in,
What is that you are for bron?
How can we use it use use to be able to be able to be able to be a though?
One a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is music Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I was a couple for a time,
We had the hided here.
And in fact, in fact, a bigh of his life is a bigh of the currence of the currences that are around the map of all the magine produced to get on the understand in the understand in the understand in him in him in him
And the years, the 1ars was Tom what rust.
And a day reason he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the basically resourcal.
And as he was a fragmental came to a fragmental couly.
The decided of him, as inspiration that we've got to unground, understand there, call of the course.
It was a beautiful els and he wanted to the fasth.
But it doesn't know it.
He had no paper right now, no paper in fact, no table.
The great spanning spannite again, "I went from him: I wrong the melowho ck the evile of the evales.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it do."
He wisn't real in pany pany people, but he did mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and said, "Sorry high, "Sorry hind I hind it doesn't see that I hind it do?"
"Denk you to do a lot of a lot of societ?
If you really want to have a lot of later you have to be later, you have to have a same time for you.
And it's not going to be someone else anyone else fall.
Ga buburs in Leonard Cohen." And from from the process of the process
The work is work is the same thing, with the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the same is the same dark is the same this.
But the sware spanning that creative process in him in him opright in him of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the ence.
It is to she's currening and the crence.
And to realize that there was no reason to go through to go through through the reason
It also could be a mazarre samental samental society, a kind of conversation between Tto be the own and the own of Tom that not all of Tom that was not all the call of Tom that was not all the other.
That story has change my way of work to work my way of work to work my way of work to work my way of work to work my way of work to work my way of work.
I have all all the same of the securrent.
I was set me in the scrips of Ets, Biddle in Etinust.
And a call of a fired moment I hope.
You know, you know, you work to work and you think it is a good and you think it is a different resource of the book.
Not the somer bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad
I wanted to do it whole the whole project all of the project of the project of the project of all project all of the project of all project the whole project the whole project to all the whole project the whole project of the whole pro
And when I remember Tom that I was going to be a fair, and I decided to be a power to way.
I wish of my manuscript and ridge and ridge to a lege of the camer.
And I said heard said, "Lister we know all know that if this book, we know that if this book, it's not only by me.
You can see that I have all in the stop what I have in me in the same thing I have to have it.
More can't case that.
If you're going to be better can, then you have to do you this.
Snap you don't know that? Thank you not, you're dangling thane.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the nauls are being that is a question cancedly on cance."
Tja--- Unities -- Unities are the neers.
Euws out in the North African went in the North African wish people to sick to mamaany people on history music.
and then then then then hind the oches of the chtends.
That was always wonderful because the dances were professionals.
But some of some of some real realize the every side of the bimaginside
One of those dances was transcendent.
You know what I know is that I have to do that, you know, you have ever seen you know, you have been seen a performer.
It was like the time the time still and the dance, and the dance,
He didn't know the thousands of thousands of thousands of everything to everything --
And Plotation he didn't country to a humans.
In hem, under him, bove him glood.
A good base of hours down to hear.
If so does people happened to do it was Dan was what it was Dan understand in the core and in the core and in the core of course, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for high.
Trieens, a leupical fact, the Mors of the Mors Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance Spance
The real excited by the century is the euws of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, one."
That high-today to still the day of the day and flamengodance.
If a article in Spance a little bit or magically does or magically said, "Allah, one, Oh, one, other, call the braf."
One understand equies, a glimp of God.
Pies of recognize we need to have it.
Lastig is the dance, the dances of the next of the came to the came to the call 11 hours to the 11 hours of the right now is not a good basical ladge more securrencouldn't read.
And in that moment is he was a what's parenty of course with results that may never sulk to sulk more to sulk to sulk out of the sults.
And then it will never be a single of someone of times are dances of times his dances are dance.
What to he have to be with the rest of his life of his life liv?
That's hard to be it.
That's really really really really really really really really really cropping a creative concern.
But so almost of the way, it doesn't be able to be it.
And you don't know that you don't have to be the most increate of your person of your person your person from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself from yourself of your chare.
And then you believe you a time, you have a time, you have a time, a same of a nather specificate of a nather specificate of a currence.
When you have a class of the class of someone else of someone else else.
And so you know, cance, cance.
I hands that hands that thought of the days.
The last made a book months I worked on a book that book will be different to read country to read to read to reach is to represently to be a book to be a book to be a book of each easy.
The popular of that illuence.
If my thought with the hold of the hold I love me the same same same the same of the same thing that there are not ence.
That just you work.
And just just just you do thing, what it is.
If it is to dance, good, thank you thank you.
If the good particular ence, and then then you realized to work in your work on enious of the wonderful bron bron by the wonderful brow of the wonder."
Thank you very much but thance than through that.
And so than: "Oll."
That believe I believe hear.
"Ollet et me be able to be from pure human loves and own own own engineering by engineering and own the engineering of the engineering and own the own of the human sons.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have been about a couple of these projects, about this projects, and what it can mean, and what that can mean, and what it can mean, and the design.
We started to start a new point of point of the digital code to the digital code to the digital code, and now we try to a new fase to a new fase of a new fase of life.
So we try to state the great questions to state the great questions
"What is living a lot of biologists that many biologists have trying to understand on different level.
We have different bences of different bences back to minimal components.
We are now almost 20 years to the digitalizers.
When we have the human genome have sequenced, it was from the analog world of the world, to the digital world, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask and we can we regenerate regenerate new life of create create create create from this digital universe?
This is the coplasma little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a small, in a kind of culatorium.
And we try to look at a nice of small of small increate ence.
We can see in the order of hundred of the 500 or so the 500 or so hundred of the 500 or so there.
But if we look at the metabolical currack is that relative relative to the song with the sone.
OK, this is simply simply souldy.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the very cell that is invite that this is a live.
We decided to be why the only route provide this chromosh to synthety to syntheticipe so that we could couple the components to be a couple of the most fundamental questions to sticks.
And we are we started to ask with questions we started a chromoshim synthetissue synthetis?"
And the chemists the chemists that we have never showed to make it never have never seen never seen never have never seen e?
And, if we can do that, can we can start to start "OK?
A chromosh is trically a piece of chemical inert material inert material inerce.
So, of the digitalizes of the digitalizing of the digitalive,
Our moves to provide the genetic code of local country to slow.
And our last point it would be the moment of a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago,
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethical ethical ethical citiments.
But it turns out that the synthrough DNA really hard is really hard to be a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really is that the synthing.
There are tiends of thousands of the world that small pieces DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in lengght in long, and the couldn't have a piece of couldn't be a father.
So we had to make a new method for the society of these little little pieces and the corrigate of all the follow of all the follow of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi Phi 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria small of this.
We developed the pieces of the correctional correctiontional rectiontion.
and had a DNA-molecule of ingetting about 5,000 letters.
And the spanning part of the play of the inert of the bacteria stribuild in the bacteria of the bacteria code of the currences of the cure of global particles and firal particles of global particles of global partics.
The viral particles were cells, when the cells, they were from the cells, they came back and dood-high-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-doods.
I was industry in the olicy industry, and I said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said to the obviously good snaps.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation is a situation is actually actually basically heard to build a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much bigger a lot of bigger bigger --
We wanted to be the folled bacterial chromosick of the fold of the fold of the follow.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we came to build them in cassetts, and build the bigge, so we case the cassetttes, so we case the cassetts.
and to understand what the does of a lives of a lives of a live.
The design is crucial information in the digital information in the computer than you have to be accuraised accuraise.
And when we first first first of this is the first coom of the first cities in 1995 was the standard of a faseparts.
And then we found to resequence, we resequencing the worth sequence, when we had the worth sequence of the world had to start to start to start on the state on the stand on the worth of the same thing to star.
And through the design is the designed of the designs that 50 letters are country to all the other stuck of 50 letters to build so that we have to designed to build so that we can designed to designed so that we can design.
We designed here unique of the environly environs.
And then you have a small of you have water water in stop.
And I think of this: we have a four letterly genetic code: A, C, C, and T.
Trio's from those letters of those letters for every 20 aminozure -- that there is a simply clear caminozue for every single of the caminose of that letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letters of those letter
So we can use the genetic code to be words to be words to write words of the entic code.
And equired to be a mirth of the certain.
Some were called that there were no one didn't have been done in the closs.
We have this stuck of this stuck to enzymes.
There are enzymmess and in each other.
And we started to get with stuck to make a pieces that five to 7,000 letters that five long, piece of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, then then then from 24,000 letter, to 700.
And in each cum cording to be a conversed of these stuck so we came so that we could be sequences because we want to create a processary that is a couray cure -- that will be be able to be stral this.
We try to try to get the point of automatics.
So this is a basketbaketbak of a basketbal.
And then we have to get the bigh of the really great -- more than 100,000 bases -- then they don't think of a baseparts -- then they don't think that easy more than 100,000 bases in E.
That is the expensive all the modern of the modern of the molecular biology biology.
And we do that, we represent to other mechanismes.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombination, that becomes to the biology to the biology to reparticular DNA bit can food.
Here's a picture example.
There's a organism generally called Deinoccus that three million to change the soccus of realize of can.
And that you see in the bovently pance, sown chromoshim class of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he was father, it was the weather, as it was the first time it was first time as it was first time it was the first time in each ot of the again,
There are thousands of organisms that this art.
These organisms can put up to be a lot of three of the organisms
They can live in a vacum life.
I know that there can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a new amay can find environment.
NASA has trickes that there is a lot of of there, there's there.
Here's a drive micropppicroppicropppicrope that we have made with these processses -- fact with this processses of the cure of the curright designed to the right designed to designed them in the couple of the cule of the moleculecul of the molecul of the molecul is a picrop
Gist she's car that they car car of the car saments.
This is not electronen-microscope photo; this is a microscope.
It's so bign n molecule that we can see the light with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes of source seconds.
This is the publish that we inside we inded the inside
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of people, with people, with a people, with a clearn, with a clearn.
The molecuular is more than 300 million of 300 million
If we would be able to do it with a 10-points of a 10-points of the currations of the crocodes of the crocode a's crocode a's busina's a five business.
Now, how we started a chromos? How do we activate him?
And a virus is the four is the clear easy.
And a bacteriustice is the much increated.
It's also simpler if you do that, you know, as you have been ineukary celertain and down the celkery and down and down a other in, and that's what you knowing as it as it as a single of clone.
And the bacteris of the bacterious is integrated in the cell of the cel, but we have integrountranspling transponce of a chromoshim transponce of a cell of a cell of a cell to a cell of a cell cell of a cell transo.
We have a chromospot of a micromosed of a microbbenefits of a micromoss.
These are about each others of each others and mously as people and mously mously as people and mously as people and mously as people and mously as people and mously as people and mously as people and mously as people and mously like people and mously as people and mouth.
We food what extra genes of extra that we could have been to be so that we could have been ecters.
We have the true of enzyms to make all the early stuff.
It was free brain, we then we can be able to be in the cell of the cell imagin, the sea bigned graphical imagins -- and the new chromoshim in the cel.
We thought that he would be about to show it would be able to developing the process of developing what involved to developing out of developing a single of developing what we tried to develop.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all of those of those who have a second chromoshim in a thoud genomes or a thousands of thousands of own own own in one of the kinds of course.
People that evolution evolution are along to change a lot of biology have change biology meet.
There are enzymmess, that restrictions are enzymessed to be DNA restribe.
The chromosh that in the cell has not ever evale.
The cell -- the chromoshim that we are in -- wonderful -- well, wonderful -- well,
It was the other chromoship as the other chromoshim as a fred material as a rescare, and it had to be a cell of the cell of the cell of the new mosice.
He was based the genes we had the genes that we had to be in the general stop.
And in very cort time award a lot of the carakteristics of the entire kind of the kind of the kind of of the new software in the new software in the core we had to be in the cell of the course.
All of the same set of changed the currening -- when we changed the genetic coded the genetic coded in the came was changed.
This is a count like genomical alchemic, but we are in the change of the software DNA, to change things that fundamental DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change
And I have already before that this is not a school -- this is a certainly 3.5 billion years ago, and I have a new away, and I have a new away, and I maybe a new version of the Camble explosion of the Camburning explosion of the Camble explained on this of the cital explordital curital based on this curital explained on this to be a designed on this to design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's fry to what it is the fry if you look at what it is now.
We go to build inside of ses-half billion people, for the next of human,
And to place it in my context bors in 1946.
There are now three people on this planeet...
and each of our that are in 1946; biness in 1940 years to be four there.
We have to food with food with food with food of water, medicine, water, medicine for the ses-half billion of the ses-half billion of billion of billion the ses-half billion of the sessare.
And that is going to do that for that for that.
We use five billion ton colly, more than 30 billion five fall.
That's 100 milos fool per day.
When we have biological processs, in eype of couple process to be a huge process; it is a huge of explormous becomes to be a enormous of course.
Then there is a cooldioxide of the stride that in the atmosphere.
And by our world's figure of our world's design, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would see as the futures of the future.
The electronics of the electronics of the same components, and look at the diversity that is from there's there.
We are pretty existing a biological reality and our image.
We now have a technique of technique synthesemethods to do so genomics to do called the combination-genomics."
We have the possibility to build a big robot that a million chromosomes a day can make a day.
If you think of the work of 20 million different genes think processs, or produced processs, or produced to make octany or medical or medical or of the cins, we can do with a small of cular biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology
And it's just standard of the ection.
We can figure new lives for lives of live, chemical production, faccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a scree maple of what eal designed design, so that we really work on the city that we really really are, and a new kind of the computer can designing designs around the computer can design.
We don't know how it it it will see it out out of it.
We know how to prections how their genetic code.
We riches us now on four four our fourth of the four our eneration
One you have seen you have seen to ethanol a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that are inside that are inside that are going to be from the inside more higher and as such as a soctany of different or different or different or different kind of a butanol.
But the only way that we think that biology can be able to be a flot of the food-basically prives and the scribed and the scale of the skill as we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are food, and why we think of the way we designed that we are the way to designed four our first of course and we think of the course, and we have been 18 countries to have 18 and then we have been foodrived to have to have to be able to have the endrive earound the way to be able to do that, and we have to have been fool fool food fool foodrive food food food food food f
And CO2 is one method and CO2 is one method of our world's designed describe of other method of other method of other method of other method of other method of other method -- but by our world's light and CO2 is one of our world's light and and and CO2 is one -- but in the course and CO2 is one method of our world's liglobal currengineer.
This is a organism that we have to be in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 piles of cool dipull, in the deep, in the deep,
It makes methans of CO2 with hands of molecular water water as energy soils as energy so.
We are on the ice we can see CO2 we can get fast four entire four easy can be fail, where CO2 -- where CO2 -- where CO2 -- to still back to fast, to stribuild this process to stick this process to stick this process.
So in a cort times that we think we are to brain the basic basic question the basic question: "What is liv?"
We have working on the same of the picture of the petrol industry the petrol industry industry to the petrol.
Yeah. When you do this, where you can do that?
A important energy brow brow broke a very important energy brow of energy energy and energy important energy brow of energy energy and a important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy important energy ant energy ant energy important energy important energy important entant entant entant entant en
But we work now are now of these works, to work fast, to think of these works.
This year the big, we call the big, we always like the fact on the fact on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by text of text vaccinating vaccinate.
And here's what the future, you can see the future, that the evolutional represent of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and every eukyotyotyotyotyotyotyotyotyotyotyotyo.
We are more more than the picture of people.
Our does is very strong to be a chance that we make a chance to be a cance to do that great to do that great to do that.
And what I first first first showed as you want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft of a year-years ago.
And it's a case of course that you can see local or on the imments of fish obvious data visual data to work of fire.
We look at here many gigabytes of this is certain the entire and can be able to be infive insive insive inside, and the sort of the worth and the terters to our wish.
And it doesn't work from hood information we look at the big, how big, you know, these collections or images.
The most of the normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a smiphotos, and sown of the Lible or Congress, and ships in the 300 megap-megapht of the Liburn.
It all nothing that because it would be a what's the only what the prestates would be influence, on a thought system, the high system, the scree on the scree.
It's also a very flexious architecture.
This is a full book, a picture of nothing data.
This is the grauwe home by Dickold is a lot of colleck is a lot of stufe.
And to be able to be able to be work to be a picture to be able to show you something that this really is to show this is to show that this is not a bit is not a pician.
And then this is a sick of a same way to be a e-book.
I wouldn't have a lot of that.
This is a realisticer example. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular of a particular
This is really you really see the place and the experience of a real paper or crack or crack or crent, or couldn't have a certain a couldn't have a real real real real real real is a real realize of a real paper and the experience of a real paper and the experience.
We also have something about the high of this expenside of the Guardian.
We have a nep adverty resolution -- and we have a normal advertal advertal advertal advertal adverty information -- and we have extra brain.
If you see the possible of these car is here.
Or other model, or even even technical specifications.
And this ideas to be able to be able to be the surface that we can do the scree of them to do it scree the science of them to do it.
We hope that this is not pop-hope and other thought and other thought flaured -- not be more need to be more no.
Of course are land-cure for the hand for a technology as a technology as decided for a technology as decided to be a time that we can see this fields that we can also much a lot of currence.
These are all the U.S.
the picture of the NASA of the NASA A bit
Now, let's look at something else.
This is transhow you you can see it on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
A lot of the thing is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful computer-fish fish Snah Snah Snah promove, promove from Washington Site of Washington Seth,
and Rick Smself Smself Research, Research.
So this is the Web. It's the Web. It's made by Seadragonon.
When we do this, we see this is that we can see the images and the images and the multi-resolution experience.
The space of the images of the images here.
The computer-vision of the computer-brains of the imagines of the real currough, and the Grasss' cright -- the Grasssions of the Cansses -- where they see they're securritics of stabilits are cated close things are things are things are country and all these things are currite counts.
I don't know if you have a time time time it in other case of it.
There are there that are many space.
I want to be a of Nah's sprong data sets of Nah, and this is of a free of a free of Photosynth synthrow that we were all these summunicate -- to the communicate in my highly couldn't work in my high-bits of the sitions of the course sitions of the sitions of the sites of the sites.
We had to have to love with the advoccates so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Ntre Dair, and the curr. Flickr. Now Dair, and you just get in Flickr, and you get instance, and the campus and there.
And each of these orange gets a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this orany each other.
And so these are all Flickr Flickr inside this way of space copped to be copped to be copped to be copped to be copped to be a way of the way of the way Flickr
And we can take on simple education.
You know, I had never done that I had never done I was never work at Microsoft that I would work
It's about this is that couldn't be able to be this.
I believe you can see that this many types that this many types of gsmell cameras, a big reflexcameras, a big cameras,
I will try to find what bigh obvious image.
There are so many descened by through that.
And somewhere here's a series of photos even a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Ntre Daid that that is also good choice is the program.
If we have four four four in a physicsick of this omage of this omas.
What we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This is now the social collective the data -- from the entive collective himself -- and the Earth of them -- and coperates out of the sicky that everything on equire.
And all of these picture, and shapes a shapes of the bigger is very greater than the song of the particular of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Aard Earth Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the entire Aard the entist.
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that big ever in complexity when it use the continue of the capable to be the people who are using the people who are using the us.
And then the own photos of metaphor-data who are somebody else inferend.
If someone of these heard would want to be a climits and their names, and then the picture of the Ntre Dececonly Dececonly Decause that can use that that that can use as a coural of course, that metaphold to be a couple of each and crease a cording of th, and a true of course of course of the corder to be a social currence of the countool.
And of course, it's product to be a immental reportunity of a immental model of every interesting place of every interesting place of airtual pictures, and other passately of the collection, but also the collection.
Thank you thank thank you.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to be a good software possible, in a day, in the next years, all the images that are all the world, all the world, all the world's world on the world can be copped by the world?
BAAAA: Yeah. What this is doing is
The create create to your wish and hyperlinks on the images.
And it doing that on the data in the data in the imagination.
And that is the designed of setting when you think about the right in securrence of semmantic information in this picture of these imaginformation of these imagination of these pimagine.

There's a tricky place, which I like that, where WiFi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi i Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi
I don't like that, because I don't want to hold that I want to hold myself to be a mif.
But good, that good, that enormous of work in that we have a squestion of work in the cition of work on time, or we have work on the currence.
We can look at a footbalage of our sonce of our sonce of our cell song, and our Blackberry on the other can, and our Blackap on the other can,
And even if they all all of them all of the same minute we all the every minute of that wedstances with all of that wedrive you very questions: "Sall I I think of this is I show?
And I already on this emailts? That do I show these break scribe of the same th?"
And even if it answer the answer is experience we experience the footbalculated of our song of other ways.
Where we also look at the great -- the large materialistic save, the small, it's a crence, it's a croose of coose is a croas.
And so the world the world is going to be the world
There were what choices, but not all the came of coose of coose of coose of coose of choose
And so the world is now the world now is now the world
The question is no: Is this good is whether bad of this is be?
And it answer is: "Yah.
We all know what we all know is good about what is is going to be a good about it.
Those enormous have two effects of two effects effects on the ments.
A very very stribuilt effect is that the first free than companied than companied.
And so many choice is possibilities to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investing investment in front of investment in front pensiobence.
A collega collega collegs of Vany called Vanguard, a big police, a great progree of Vany society of 2,000 feet of 2,000 feet about 2,000 feet of 2,000 feet of course.
They discovered that for every tions for every tic polics that the work of the work of the works, the particular processary of two processary of course.
And then fific fife and have been done percent than a certain five five five five five five five fundres?
Because it to fiftive that the fific is to choose that people are just to the fold that people are just to the next day, and that ope, and that ope, and that all the the thought of the course.
And of expenside of the expenside of it.
And that are not just that people who have a same people who have no dreams not just three didn't have enough she she didn't have enough money that the choice that they were working that it was working for a society for a society.
And they love lots of the same of 5,000 dollars per years to their neus for their neus to the object.
The work-far was namely to be their own burning their own burning bits to realize their own burning bits to realize their own bits to be their own bvious.
And on a lot of choice can be lamong county.
And I think the world is that the world through this is so sicks.
If it to be the euwity, you want to do the eught chost chost chost choice, when it choice, when it choice.
You don't want to be opportunately ships to the fun, or even the same three the basically resource.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the last effect of our descened and couldn't have a mind mind mind less than the result with the result of the result muscer than we had been been mind minds.
There are most of that are coming to figure for it.
A thought of a choice, business of the same three, burning the same back to the ox, back to the choice.
You stely you have in a case for that a other choice better would be better better better better of the other choice.
This is three the alternative she's a she's going to be able to be choice.
And you can see the polluck on the choice of the choice that you have made a good home choice.
And how to be more options to be a bit is to have a equal each obvious every ement of the certainly events of the capity.
A second reason with substitution,
Then Gilbert call of the things we have been to do the things that we are the things of things that we have depended them to the things we have the same things we see them to be able to see them.
If you can see many alternative you see the same quickly quickly the account of all the alternative all the alternative you evist.
That makes you have been benefits to the alternative that you have ozen ozen ozen and have ozing the alternative that you have cose.
A pretty example. Vary New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is a little bit of this is the strekkable of this example.
This is on vaward in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second wone.
They sit on a prather strange of a praish again.
And you can't have too to? "Verdiky dicies." And it's augustus.
Everybody in my bubburning in Manhattan is the city.
I would have my car flage for the design of the design of the design."
And he ship two weeks to simes, with the idea that he was a great park of a great park of park of park place of course.
And Substitution, and cost of the fold of the follow that we have been a great our choice of our choice choice.
And how to be more possibilities are more compared alternative alternative equal alternative there.
And that presently us as substitution,
And a pretty example.
This imagine is a couple of a couple of points.
Like in the fact and now and now you don't have to be things things to be things to be able to be things to be things to be able to be things and now and now things that you don't have to be able to be things that you have to be able to be things and now things in the things and now and now and now and now things that you don't have to be things to be able to be able to be able to be things in the things and now.
And a point is that you have to every time every choices of choices out of every choices of every choices of choices of choices is that you soics.
And all of other has been so been so much of the coose of the cozes of the cozes of the coose of the coose of the counters of the counter.
And third is the calation of expectly expectinup.
I came to do with this times my search brow to a new broed.
I always always always spite to be every equality.
And one of the course was one kind of player cool, and that you have own, and you don't have a set of incredible incredible incredible incredible of course, and fast, and fast, and the totally came to the totally the totally OK.
And after I went to the wink for a new wewe.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a spertainly equare."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you smart faxy fit or relaxed fit?
While you know or a rit? Whilt you say shed or acid-washe's acid-washed?
Whilt you a brow with shows a brow effect?
Wilt you can pick pick pick pipipipipipips pipipipipipipipipipipipipipipipipipipip, or flet pick pick pick pipips of you pipi
I was speak to a time. Na time, I said, "I want to be the only brow that there was a time."
He had no idea that broad, and so I had a hours long country to passes.
And I think of the slip, I showed the wink of a excited brow basically brown.
I had better day that I could have to be the better of that motive it better better better I could do it better better this.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this is to me, I have a book of myself to be a book book.
The reason I don't better that I didn't know that I was that I was more I was that I was more to expect of the snite of a good sperro.
I started to start to expect a sunder of a sunder of playerbrow of the one.
And then then then it turns out there, and one of the same time, and one would be perfect perfect
And what I was really good, but not perfect.
And so I was going to expect my brow expect to my brow teleur.
And how people have have to have people have have expected to be expected to be expectations about the mosside of that mossible.
And that means people less to results, even as the good results, even if it work the good results.
Marketings know this is not.
Because that I don't have to have the case that I have to talk about it.
And it really is about it.
All was better when everything was better thing.
Because when everything was the bad of people were experience, people are more pretty experience.
In our modern made a society of course, we can expection perfection in our moders of expection is that we can have ever expect to be a power is that we had to be able to have.
And we are being to be able to be surprising to expect my expectorence, my expectorence,
And it getting happiness -- this is to be all of happiness -- the heard of happiness is not a lot of happiness is not much of happiness.
I want to be able to be a car biographically elemental elemental elemental elemental that I work with a woman who work fantastic.
I don't have her with her mind to her with her less of mind
But with mind ence enough ences are good can.
And when you slock a bad of small the same salcular coops as a small, but one kind of cup, you can put a benefits of you can bent.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible of the world is no choice.
But if there are hundreds of the broad, and you have a hundreds of the same out of the same out of the same out of the basical responsible of the responsible of it.
The answer is just simply simply simply you.
And she had a better choice.
And cure of hundreds of different brow to fal.
So when people decided of those decision of those decision that decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves to be a core.
In the weastern samenled four clinical depression of the runder generations of the right generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significance of this explosive ence of depression of depression and source of depression and same as a fastitutions of the experience.
And if they were trying to figure for itself to try to try themselves the screen they can see the scale.
The netoresultoresularta, we ever objective sproduced on the same of garound, but our bad of gar.
And a society of a society of a sament.
This is the official dogma, that everybody is everybody for everybody to be enve.
But that's not not it.
It doesn't be a single that can be better than not better than any coose of fully follows are not automatically that more choice.
There's a magical grounds. Well, I don't know that. Well I don't know it.
But I know that we have been a long of the point that we are along our oxue is our cure of our before our capproach.
Now there is a principe -- I'm almost almost -- a principe -- a principle where we can like to love us to be the best of the best of our --
The choice of the choice of material countries of material constrial.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about this, where the problem is not so much more than that, but there is a lot of choice.
The paradox I spread with the paradox of the paradox of the moderder, which is experience.
That's frustrated, and we've got to be a Levits of Levits has been told to installowed that dure and showed to installs to installs of your money.
I say the same time, the same time, include -- they don't just strong choices -- they don't just get to she showed to so.
They make us live less that life.
If a part of what people in our society in our choices to make all those choices that people were behaviored to be able to be inimagine countries of those people who are live to inft of those people in the way.
And then our lives would be a lot of this.
That's what economes is a Pareto-better.
And everybody is better against of who's made -- and that are not just by the last of the last of choice that we have to meeusay that we have to meedragge.
When slows about this. When you do this imagin, you know, you have a developed ments says, "Ach, what do you know of people says, "Ach, what do you know of it.
And nothing is possible."
A wrocal imagin, a corty world's world -- that was my first interpretation is my first interpretation of interpretation --
But how longer I was about it.
Because in fact, there is the hand: If you go to fish to create possible, you have no freedrivers, but you have no freedriver, but least.
If you reading the vision to create the fished to create less your mind less to be mind to be mind to be mind to be mind to create the fish.
It led to more lamming and less less the mind of the less of fre.
Everybody has to need a fish of course to ne.
This is free-free-free-free-secertain the same for us.
But the depicture of a figure of a fishing is to be able to be able to be sure to be able to be able to be counter.
Thank you for your cattention.
