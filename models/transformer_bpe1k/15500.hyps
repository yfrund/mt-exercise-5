And I show these two dia's two dia's to show that the police capable, who was three million years of years of the last three million years of the United S, with 40 percent of the United States flaccounts.
But this is actually the real problem is the worst of this specific problem because it doesn't the disector.
The ice cape on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global system.
It is out of the winter and crack in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a fasted version of what the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened the next dia of what happened the next dia of what the last 25 years is a fasted diversion of what happened is a fasted dia of what happened the next of what happened the next dia member of what
The permanence is clearning in rood.
As you see it from the dark of dark blue.
That's the yearal ice of the winter.
And the crack in the summer.
And the called permanence, five years or old years or old years or old in the body, as blood, that from the body.
In 25 years is the way of this is going to this for.
And that's a problem because the frors around the North correctly around the North correctly there is a very great amount of cool cool is free and, when it was designing deed, when it was designed by microbes in methane.
Fore with the total high-fieless in the atmosphere, that would be able to double how to double the course, if we can double the cragge.
In some unclearn in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
And, Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University with another team to another understand another unep me.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real or we will be be able to be that
A reason that is, this is that this enormous "heated Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water volume is greater than ever ever bigger than ever free.
This is the Kangerlussuagest in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea country because it country because it country to be the place where it is the place where it in the sea real coming in the sea of the sea real coming in the sea cuttter.
These are taking stroming flightly to it.
And then the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the South policy is the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And Africans are rapported scientists that the whole continent now a negative imaths of the ice balance of them.
More specifically is the ice of the South polar of the South polling of the South polics, with nast, with name.
The whole continent is six meters for six meter, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after size of the ice of ice called new years ago, who were new now, who were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is going to be half of the drager of that smels.
In the Andes, this glast the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also dress the dinclude water.
In California was a fifer of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are nstigated.
This global dreaming dreaming to a dramatic styce.
And the number of course, all of the whole world is cited with an incredibly faster and never seen fast.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the past 30 years in the past 75 years.
This pattern is completely unpretty under.
If you look at the shistoric context than a historic context what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton on on CO2 hours --
Now five me, every day in our oceans, Keans, looked at the east area of the Stille Ocean every single of the Stille Ocean on the Indian subcontinent, there is a dragy of the Indian subcontinent, there is a dragge.
The only great caused of the Earth, nast, naves for 20 percent to 20 percent believes for 20 percent burnities.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the most great problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extinitions, with China.
And there was a imagine of cities, and build cities.
But we see a member of it.
These are the cities, which is the bold of the building was annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last of the benefits were proposed in the last of the benefits of the bities.
There's a political stripe on the country.
The cities, and olil industig in 250 million dollars of dollars to promotle, which is a cutting cool to promotle, which is a promotlect of promotle.
And that picture to something like this.
And Rond the currently was at at at me, at me at the core of course of cools cools cools cool.
You have the probably in the news.
This is the one after fired in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cities, the Kerst was done was thing.

He is conversation in America, and he sare in America, and he sare growing our economy.
Frosty the cities, with the day sunitions.

Here's a big part of the citied of the cities, in West Virginia of the cities.
The biggest mine of the country is the great bass of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klims protection for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our things for our things
That's the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantic again, to give to the reclassion to the light and the realize of the truth of the truth of truth of the truth of truth cool.
Fite is not salize is not smart.
We think it's a son -- and the right -- and the right -- and the right now.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me only about it.
Video: Acuriting Schone cool, you have heard about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern city-cities.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of law.
But that's the sound of song,
And thanks the fact that the fact that the fact of the most important thing of the most important causes of the Earth is changing the earth is profably the remarkable of the education of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth is changing the earth of the earth is change.
Look around the song around technology of the salong technology of today.

Ford America of 100 percent scue electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to get a plan that our work is a plan that our earth of the Earth called the Earth catch.
And then a solution that is a solution that is to solve our problems on our problems.

Al Gore: There's an old African speaks, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go far, you know,
We have to go far, and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I really, I returned to come back with a hore about how that works.
So here's the one of those who don't have anyone who were not the LHC is the largest scientific experiment in the enometer, 27 miment miles in the ometer.
It has to be the circutting circutting to be less than a billion done billion done the universe to 600 million times per second.
And norm ambition!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors and this is the one that I work with the one of the ATLS detector -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the age of ATLAS in the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was called ATLAS.
That care of a party party in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that helemped around the LHC ging, and with operating a piece of the LHC, where particles in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September wish we know that the machine worked on the machine worked on the enormous consider.
I don't know if this is the biggest right, or this, or then, then, when someone to Google and saw that the Internetpage and saw that the Internetpage.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what to make with these golden decided with these golden decided to these gold behaviors.
And that was 13 thousand thousand amps of course, when the machine on the follow.
The ingengineers are saying "Not who's worth true. It's totally small the small of your drather."
They can do that because they do superature are very low temperaturs.
So at myself colder than the space between the global than the gars, that can read that strandomm.
In one of the connections between the nects of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And then it was a little bit of being something were increated to be electrical weather, who was 13 thousand amps.
This was the result.
This is still increated when you realize that magnets more than 20 ton the way 20 tons, and they were about 30 centimeter.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of it.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now they're going back on away.
Eind might be the LHC weather.
We will be able to be able to be able to be expected in you, or you're going to be able to go with the expect with the expect of the universe.
Now, of course, who have increated increated the value of science the value of science research. It's easy to connect.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be able to be able than ever the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English science Humphrey Davy, did I slow designed experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous to the object of the human minds, and then we have to take our images of the human minds of science, and that our being ever definitive in nature, and we did our design, that we have compless the compleave that we have been design that we are design -- and dionsionside of the design is to ded explavicath of the lactated to design is that we are ded extrach of the scovers are designed to be able to leastany of the scovers are ded explath, and ded existath, and
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask to ask to your children's time, when you play with block with block with block of the block of thing.
And then you discovered how to understand how to understand and and amazing up to the deal problems to learn with the depended by the engineers.
Rumulate insight is strongly because with the world to understand us.
If a information of information, inspired by physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advisual interaction with my advisithi -- I started to ask Jeevan Kalanithi -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we have a computer, as a kind of high-finger as a kind of information with a plate to a single of information with a place to a place with a place of information of information with a fitation with a fitation of information of information with a fitive place of information with a fyonate sular interace of fular inters of fular inters of itation of fultace bitation with a fulation with a place of fulation with this is an an an an an an
And as we can make orders like we want to leave it?
This question of us so decided that we decided to search an answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort say, a Sifty interactive computer in the size of a cooky big.
They can be able to be able to be able to put each other, they can feel their movement dectors and purposes a screen and depended to contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handled of block to understand by flock to understand with understand with it.
For example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for the way, for the way, for the way.
And that these helpended is a physical different ent approactly have been aware of their movement and even of the way we have to figure out of the way we have to discovered they're different new and life, there are different new and like.
I'll start with some simple examples of the simple.
This Sift is instituted to show to tell a video to can't play anything to can't play anothers played and othersing can't play any the back of the same thing to be playing to show to do anything to show to can.
These interactive portraits are conscious awarence.
Indience to each other, they will be interests.
And if they are called this and they can be able to be able to be what are being waits becoming to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the cup.
And they feel feeling and helling.
We realized algaup, one of the interesting of the interesting of this interaction, the using of the interaction, as it was a fluence of a color as it was a fluid as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid as it was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction, as a single of the interinteraction, as the
In this picture Siftables for examples of the examples for and I can use them to use them to make them to be able to go color in a legal to go into a legal example.
If we have three, we have to remember.
There are some cape capabilities for the education, pretty play play with language, mathematics that we want to give things like to give things like to give things like to prober, and the result to see the result of the ear.
Here's the developing of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmmmmical programmmmmic.
Here's a game between a game between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Siftile letter around a light of the Siftable, and cased words are controllling in a dictionary in a dictionary of book.
And after about 30 seconds is being the conditions, and different to seconds a new series of letters with breakthrough capabilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I love it out of the slowed to make it out to make a video of make.
They were really really really away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of these applied to do is that people almost people almost no instructions needs to have instructions to have instructions of the most interesting things need to have instructions of the most interesting things that people have almost interesting to be instructions of the most interesting things that people have nearly nearly needed to have instructions to have no instruction
Everything you have to say, "Make word." And they know what they need to do that.
Here's some other people to the test.
That's our boy is our bota testrongest bent.
And it seems to the Siftables of the Siftable.
For him were just blocks.
Here's a interactive paintting to pinsive.
We wanted to learn a platform for learn of language.
This is Felix that demonster demonster
He can bring new characters in the scene of the course, by the same of the table, with the cumber of the table.
Here he sun. Here he cup.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tract in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done though! Yeah!
And for the shape of Siftables and the names to each the carakters to reach other, he can respond with each other: We!
DM: And so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a picture of it.
and he decisions.
Video: The catastate.
DM: The last example that I will show that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music to have a sound produced to developed a sound product of sound product like the lead, as the lead, as the lead, as the lead, bases.
And anyone has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
And these sound sound Siftables can be injected injected so that you can deployly impact to pattern.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a legal Sift of a legal effects as reverble efully and filter.
They are become to a sound and sound and attack by can.
Forder the algemental effects like tempo and volume to the entire pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a first pattern by an extra lead.
Now I place the basically.
Video: DM: Now I feel what sleptop.
Video: And now I couple I couline the filter of the drums, so I can influence the effect of live influence.
Video: I can cell it by the obvious of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo bloce.
Video: DM: Now I filter the filter of the basically for what more expressy.
Video: I can remember the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improviserate the hear, and I can improviserate a corter longer and corter.
And so, with the dimmms of the facture of the volume Sift to so.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from the passion of new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and lightly work and work and work and working for working and light.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designed in this designing with some possibilities that we developing to the developing of the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the couraged to a very new generation to a very new generation with digital media, which is the information with digital media, which we want to go to our world to our world as we want to do it.
Thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you all these things.
I'm writing.
Acctures is my work, but so much more than that.
My whole life long I write to write that will change that ever change to change that ever change.
And yet there is unless of something property in my life, and career to career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work in my
And it started with a book that I wrote understand a memoire: "Ets, Biinnen," Biinnen," that very much to my early work on my early work on the whole work about the whole world and an international stator.
And the consequence is that people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to alway.
Worly, what -- -- -- mean!
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me to ask you can't bang that you can't ever be ever ever ever ever evening.
Don't you do all the life that you live to be able to keep the book more a book more of the book that people will be publish to be able to be able to put for warm to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to write your whole life is going to be able to be able to be write your whole you live to the whole life that you have to be able
And you don't have a bang of that?"
And, you know, you know, you know.
Now, of course, that would be very much that I remember that I was 20 years ago, when I was a teenaginly -- if I was a teent.
People said, "Ben you don't have a bang that you never get succcess?
Don't you do that, you don't get to react to the realize of it.
Don't you do that you don't have to this work on this work without that there ever be anything from the broken and you will be able to the puin your broken dreams with your broken ditters of fairly fairly with your bitter?"
Something in that streaking.
And in the shortly is my answer to this question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are called called the things that are being called these things that are called things that are called these things that are called these things that are called called these things that are called called these things that are called called these things that are called ccalled ccalled called these things that called c
Always of time.
But I also much other things that I mean, you don't want to know that all of it.
For example, and other entire things.
But what is write I ask to the last time that the last time, what's going to come feet that angst from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically being someone to be able to be able to work for the work for the work for the work of the Earth are shed to their ment.
What is so so so about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mind of the mindity, something like this, something like to do not happened to happens to happens to happens to do the effects of the mine of the mind of the mine of the minute.
Now you take my father. He was skull, and I can't recive, and I can't recived that there was a 40 years who worked to him anyone of him or he wouldn't have any for way.
And so, "Yohn, how is the chemistry with chemistry block?"
No, so was not about it.
And to be fair being engineers have been by the centuries have no reputation to be the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists of manical alcoholists and being to.
Schetering writers that have reputation.
Not only just write other creative people have reputation to be able to be the reputation of the instable.
Look at the grimiles to the grimian under the most magnifical creative mine the 20th century.
Take young, often by own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own own through own own through own through own through own through o
And even those of those who don't have a suician under their gave under their gave to be able to be able to be their gaves.
In the last interview for his dead, said Norman Mailer: "Mevery of my books is a piece of myself."
That's very very pretty to say about your life.
But of this kind of exciting exciting in the works.
We all have the earlier and have heard and have been accepted with ""Cepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is creativity to be indicated with line and that a artist-field stended to the eventually indeed.
And so I want to ask everyone here today, you can ask with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it at the correct I think about it at all.
I think of the resense.
And also any dangerous.
I won't like to see this century that this century.
We can creative sportation much better to live sports.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for the dark of dark every dance.
Searly the fase where my career in my career now in my career now in which my career in which my career in which my career in which my career in which my career in my career in which my career in which my career in which my career in my career in which my career in my career.
Now, I'm going to be young, amper say, amper say,
I can be able to be four decade of decade of the decade of work.
And so, it probably will be able to be anything that I'll be seen as the world as the world as the world as the world as the world is just successful book.
And we are with friends with friends each other, so I can probably be probably likely to my biggest succcesses.
Jaye, what a idea!
If you think about the morning, you know, you know, the morning to the nect to the neck hours to the drive every on the drive of the drive every single of the necessar.
So I want to do that.
I love me song, I love with the work that I love of it.
And the question is: "Doe?"
And after long after long after the conclusion that I can just go through a psychological protection in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process.
I have to create a safe distance a safe distance between me, and my government between myself and my control and, very understand my continue to my future publish to my futures to the respond to the respond to the respond to the reactions of the future.
I have the last year, I went to ways that to way.
I have in the history and have to do me deep me dished to see or anothers to see or others have a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative percent of the creative process.
My searched me birth of the old Great the old Great and Romeins.
Let because it's a long and intrade.
In the old Great the old Great and Romeins believe that creativity was coming from hensive hendly of themselves was itself.
And I believe that creativity is a good particularly evity of a spirit of a space place to the humans came to the ment.
The Great the Great spirit of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And so, Socrates believe that he had a demon who had a dishem of the words of the influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they called them called a genident creative spirit to a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius not a genius without pientter piently pended penter person with a genius.
In their polically was a genion was a genial godddrugs in the mure of the ateler of the ateless of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, as the artist, the geniusion.
And he shape of the work.
And that's the psychological protector, the psychological protection to the result of your work.
Everybody knew that in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The artists was so protected to protected to be able to protectable.
If you were working for a billiant to be all the early one.
Everybody knew that a lives that a unvisible genius.
And then you work on the work of you, it doesn't only on you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty called an unus.
And so long time, the Westen creativity was being creativity was proved to be creativity to prove.
Then came up the Renaissance, and everything changed
There is a very new idea: the individual ments, the individual humans is the universe and state all the godden and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures from the goddness world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believe that creativity completely came out of the individual cm.
And for the first time in history was about artists were said that they were a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a great fail.
And to show one person, one person, one in a pial individual individual -- that he safe the eeuwer is the essentially mysterious mystery of everything good partly is to a lot of the eughtly -- that is to a frapplace for a fragulty human psyche.
And if you ask someone ask the sun in slight the sun.
Egos are being ups to gigantic proportunile, and there are universation to expect expectations to expect expectations of expectations and have been cutsions and have been representations and there are universes to gigantic proportunity to gigantions and have increated unimagined to giantly
And I think these drugs the last 500 years of artists capot.
If that is, and I think that is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a father understand the creative mysterious and the creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years rational humanism not uncted in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of thing.
And probably sat people who have realized in the audience of scientific developed about the idea that elfive that elfive to what equives with what feed-pools with the work of artists to inspire the work of artists to inspirate the idea that every single of the idea that either than the idea that either than the idea that
It doesn't seems me to get you all of that.
And I ask it to me the way.
Why not?
Why would we don't would we have thought that ever have done that next?
And it just as much as much as much as all the other explained as all the other reaches of the totally unculators that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something has trying to create -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process -- knows that the creative process is not alway.
That sometimes the paranoral.
I have unled the great American dicher Ruth Stone citions.
And she is displayer who's lives of the next.
She told me about her right on the platounds of Virginia.
Somes, if she was working on the work of work on the work she was a closing country.
It was, as it was said like a great wave wave skly.
And so, a closed wave than the country to her it.
She felt that the ground under her foot under her fools and knew that her to do that her on that moment, but one thing to do is running for her life.
And she went to home, followed by the closed and put them so quickly as quickly.
When the closed by her her her her was she was that her enly her any chance to write it on the sks.
Sometimes she was not fast.
Then right, but running the house is not.
And sular moments schools the closed by her head, on the fields, on the fields, in a other direction.
And then there were a little bit of the story -- this find I think that they are the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the close to the close of the story -- that they were almost mistake.
And then she was looking for purpose, and paper school, and schools the closed by her hear.
And Juist on that moment, she had a potoment.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me to the closed from the air.
And she picked up to his stick and back it back in her body, as she written the again.
In those case came to the case closed in the case of paper but then in the case follow.
When I thought that heard, I thought -- what happens to be my creative process of creative process of the creative process of the creative process!
And so my creative process is not my creative process is not! I'm no medium!
I'm a mile, who every day on the same time, the same time, and sweet up with blood, sweet and trans it out.
But even in that day, I had a very equired I have such a experience of experience.
You know, you will also felt to know the myself that sense that there are creative ideas in your borrels from a bron that you can can identified that you can can identified that you can identified to identified that you can identify that you can can identify that you can be impossible to be impossible to identify that you can see unc
What is that burning for buron?
How can we use it without we have become a without that we have become a
One way that we have a way to us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians to be musician.
A few years ago, I interview him for a time,
We had the him.
And in fact, a great part of his life is a great of his life of the course of the amazing of the earth, that are trying to get all the power to get all the power to get to the universe, which creative impulses that him opm.
With the years, Tom what was right now Tom what room.
And on a day reasoned in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he refreak out of the fragmental die.
The decided to him, as inspiration that fairly do, undergroup, underly, understand cumb.
It was a beautiful owho and he wanted to fasth.
But it won't that.
He had no paper -- no taperecorder to them.
And the amazing exciting exciting exciting the melody is called the melowho is remained me the melody eumber following me.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't real real won't in panic, but he stop the whole process and did new new things.
He looked at the ski, and he said, "Sorry heard that I behind the stuff that I figure out the stuff is doing the stuff that I wonder?"
"Don't you really know that I can write a song that I can write a song that I can write a song that I can write a song that I can write a song that I can write a song that I can write a song

And then realized that there was no reason to go through through through through through through it.
It could be a wonderful society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that was not very much of Tom Deail of Tom myself was not going to be at Tom myself.
That has changed my way of working on changed.
I had a little bit of every single of head.
I was in the middle, Bithese, Bithese, Bime, Bime,
And I think about a give moment, I fail in quante.
You know that well, you know that wouldn't do good and you think it is a difference. It is going to be a difference.
Not six, really did bad bad bad bad bad bad of the bad of life.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that I was remember to his genius, and I decided to be a power to way.
I wish me from my manuscript and I ships to a leave to a leave of the room.
And I said hardop: "Listerer this, we know everything, we know that if this book is not only through me.
You can see that I have in the stop I have in the stop I have in the stop in me.
And I can't give you this.
And if you find that it have to be better you're going to be able to do your this.
Stap you don't do that, you're not, right?
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular is being a lot of today that is just to change the obvious."
Tjaj--- Unities, it comes on the now ...
Euws came to dance in the North African desert people came to dance to dance to dance to dance at the sky music.
And then then hours and hours, to the morning global corns.
That was alway, because the dances were completely fulling professionals.
But sometime, very single time, something happened to be a breath.
One of that dances was than transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever seen this, you know, you also have seen a performer.
It was like the time the still and the dance of the poor, and the dance of a poor.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that meaning can meaning new sets of genes.
We started from a new point: we were a new point: we were the digital code of the digital code of the digital code to a new fase in the biology to go to a new fase in the biology to design and synthesize of life.
So we alway, we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is something that I think I think what many have been trying to understand to understand on different leveling levels on different level.
We have different approach to leaders to leaders to leave least to leave least to least least to least least to least the minimutes of the bence.
We are now the digitalization.
And then we have sequence, the human genome ced, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask to question: we can be create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of that can be considered in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at a nice or we can be able to be a nice smaller genome.
We can have in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relative to the onzero-simple with the unction.
Now, this is simple. That's simple.
But when we look at all genes to see all genes that we can look at the genes of the cell that this would be very unliving cell that this would be a living cell cell cell of life.
We decided to be the only route pretty to be this chromosly to syntheticipated so we could be able to be so that we could be able to ask the components to ask the one of the most fundamental questions to ask the most funday.
And so we started with questions to ask with questions, "Can we have a chromosly synthetiv?"
And the chemistry the chemistry of the chemistry that we have never seen earlier face?
And, if we do that, if we can do a chromosopping "OK?
A chromosophic, but a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is exponential whole.
Our capacity to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of course, but it's going to be ence.
And our last point would be the last thing on this exponential curve.
We are here more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical ethical depended to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be very hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world who make little pieces in length, 30 to 50 letters in length, so you make the piece of the course, so you make the piece of the world --
So we had to make a new method making for the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the front of all the front of all the front of all the front of the front of all the front of the front of the front of the front of the foots.
And this was our first power, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Ext Phi Ext Phi Ext Ex,
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the corrections,
and had a DNA moleculecul of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part we started to piece of chemical stor in the bacteria stop, and the bacteria code of the genetic code cuts, and viral particles and viral particles
The viral particles were celling out of the cells, they came back out of the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unleft to the oil industry, and I said that she said that model to good snaps.
They read more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which the software in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of bigger.
We wanted to build the completely bacterial chromossion of the completely
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettts, so we could build the cassettts, so we could farires flectates --
And to go to understand what the real components of a lived cell cell of a live.
The design is crital information and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accuraft.
And then we put this genome coom in 1995 was the standard in 1995, the standard of 10,000 basepares.
And then we found after we found after 30 folts. If we were used to be used to start to start used to start to start to star.
And then the design is the design is the designing of pieces that 50 letters of the other pieces with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so they can be designed to build designs that we can design to design so they can be able to design.
We designs here unique parts of it.
Maybe you read that we have water to stop water market in stopped in stopping water market.
That this: we have a four-genetic code: A, C, C, C, P, C, P, P.
Trios of those letters of those letters for right -- that there is a resource -- that there is a single atterrible atttery attack for every single aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words of thought.
And then we called "measured to me.
Some were called closed that there were no directords.
We have designed these pieces of sources that we can eath them with enzymes.
There are enzyms that they reparts and put them into each other.
And we started to make piece, to start with piece, with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long and you have a lot of 24,000 letter, to 7,000 letter, until 24,000 letter, to 700.
And in every city, we have a flot of these pieces so we could sequences to sequences because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust --
We try to reach the point of automatising.
So this is out of a basketbal.
And as we have to come to the really great pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparen -- then they don't grow easy more in E.
That is the expect of all modern tools of modern the molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombination, that becomes used by the biology to reparate DNA to reparently to reparating that pieces can food.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million rad rad to the square.
And that you see in the top panel, she clear chromosly just from each other.
12 obs later, he was put it in each other, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be able to be this.
These organisms can completely opened to be completely for thread.
They can live in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be able to be able to be able to be able to move in the space of aquatickly environment.
NASA has show that there is a lot of of it, there's a lot of of there.
Here's a real microphero-oto of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact with these processes -- fact with the right discovered with the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right displap.
And it is care that they care of automatically says.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a wonely microscope.
It's such a big molecule, we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish we have indeed.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of ever molecule, with a clearly structure.
The molecuulation is more than 300 million of 300 million of three.
If we would be able to pressive with a 10-points letter, without of spations, then there is 142 pages only to pressure.
Good is, how do we start a chromossive up, how actives we activate it?
And with a virus is clearly easy.
And with a bacteria is the far of complicated --
It's also simpleer if you live under eukaryots, as we just walked the celkers and doing the celkers out of the celkers and do another in, and that's what you know if the cell.
And in the bacteria of the bacteria of integrated in the cell of the cell transplended to show that we have a completely transplending a chromosophician to another, and can active.
We have a chromosly of a micromosed of a microbbence.
These are about as much of each other as people and mously well.
We figure out what extra genes as we could select this chromosophic.
We have the referened with answing all the egs to make all the egs.
It was fairly when we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the very cell images -- and you will make the very cell images -- the new chromosly in the cell of cell in the cel.
We even thought he would come to be able to be able to develop the process of developing to develop to development.
This is a essential evolutic mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of of the chromosing chromosly have a second of third generally thousands of thirships of the species of them.
People who are evolution evolution to imagine that have not change to change a lot of biology member to be much benefits to be a lot of biology me.
There are enzyms that are called DNA called DNA real restriction.
The chromosophim was not every cell was not every cell of it.
The cell -- the chromosly that we stop -- well, well.
It was expressive, and the reference, and the reference, and the refred material, and we had to be invited to the new chromossion with the new chromoson.
He was blue from the genes we had stop.
And in very short times of the soff all the correctord of the one species of the one of the kind of completely in the new species in the new species that we had in the new software in the cell we had stopped in the cell we were stopped in the cell of the cell we have stopped in the cortor.
All the same thing of changed the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code was the genetic coded in which was changed.
This is a may be counts as genomical chemist, but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things
Now, I mean, I mean, I mean, this is not a skull, this is pretty on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have a new version years of the Camburic explosion of the Camburic explosion of the Camburic explosion of the Cambased on this digital design.
Why would you do?
And I think it's free clearly if you look at what it is to needle.
We go inside of six-half to 9-half to 9-half to 99, the next 40 years.
And to place it in my context place, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for each of us that lived in 1946; they will be able to be four our are.
We have to food, with food, with the care of son water, medicine to the six-half burning for the six-half billion of billion dollars.
That is being to do that for necessarily to do that.
We use five billion ton colls, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 milos fesses.
When we have biological processes in egencouldn't have to replace that to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, of course, that cool dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is cool.
And for all of our global discovered we have a database with about 20 million gentle, and I like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had a dozero-fields, and look at the diversity that has been coming from there.
We are limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a techniques faster synthesize of called combinations to do combinati-genomics."
We now have the possibility to build a big robot can make a million chrobot can make a million chrobot can make a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes or thinking of 20 million different genes to make octature to make octature or medicine to producing new vaccins, we can do with a little team of the team of the science of the science of science.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select selecters for life, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinition, and so on.
This is a screading designing of what real designing real where we work on the access of the correctly and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see it from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code out of genetic code of the genetic code of how their genetic code of the genetic code of how their genetic code of genetic code of how their genetic code of genetic code of how their genetic code of genetic.
We now fourth generation now generation to fourth ces.
And you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation will come inside of coming from coming out of the sugar, as sugar, as sugar, as a different species like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology biology without the food price without the food price and the provability is to read with CO2 as we begin with CO2 as are food, and we think that are cells to design the first of those way to design the first square to design the first square in the first generation of 18 months to have been about 18 months of 18 months to have been about 18 months to have been take the first time to have to have to have been a massize that we have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to do with the foot design to be able to be able to do
And CO2 is one method and CO2 method -- -- but by our global discovered all sorts of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methos.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea five miles eight pature died, at cool.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy water as energy like energy source.
We can take to the fairly or we can be able to take corn, which is easy to be fabried to fabried to fabried to fabried to faile, to fired this process.
So in a short time, we think we are able to think we are in to breads to the break of the basic question: What is life?"
We actually have a reality, you know, -- the purposed to pull the polical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you don't do this, what do you do do this?
A important energy source becoming source
But we also work on the works, we also use these works, to think about fast.
This year was the flu was the flu ong the facts of the right now as the attaccineded on the right vaccine.
And I think that can change by teforward by teforward vaccines.
Here's how the future, you can see the future, the evolutional boom now is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacteria and eventually eukary ota.
We are improved of the improved of people.
Our goal is very strong to ask that we make a chance to make a long enough to develop to do that great to do that great to do that.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology is the fundament of a new technology that we have to go to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you can work with immense of the universe of course, fish data can work with the data can work with medical data
We look at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can be able to keep in the basically inside -- and except the sunil of the wishing to our wishing and the sort of terribs to our wishing and the sort of of course, and then the sort of course, and then we can see the sort of wish th
And it doesn't make how much information we look at the correctly, how bigs these collective or images or images or images are every big.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a photographs, but this is a single of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It makes not make anything because it would be able to influences to be influences on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image picture that is that.
This is a grauwe house by Dicks. Every collabor.
And to decided that it's really easy to be able to show to do that, we do something like this, to show that this really text is not imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book way to read a book way to read a book of read.
I wouldn't including it to be a field.
This is a realistical example. This is a figure of the Guardian.
Each big imagine is the beginning of a part.
This gives you really real the funclean experience of a real paper or or caperate or capach right or capach dium.
We also have done with the core of the core of the Guardian.
We have a next advertist of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra extra brain.
If you want to see the capacity of these car you want to see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can be really real to be able to be the limities of hands of the screen of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other thirds, not need.
Of course, a country to the hand to the country to a technology as deside of technology as this, I will spending to this fields, except that we can spend a lot of the age of the hand-of-a-basically as a whole of the hand-course, except to the technology as this, I have no times to spen
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And so much of the NASA --
Now let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who connected.
One of it is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer-vision through Noah Snah Snah Stitz on the University of Washington, promove Steve Steve Steve Seitz on U.W.
And Rick Smyiski with Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is a live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
And when we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the space of the images has meaning here.
The computer-vision algorithms have been brained with the real space with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades Rockies -- where they're gentlements of stabilized diashhically and all these things are panorama and all these things are space things are space.
I don't know sure or there is another environments.
There are a lot of space are lots of space.
I want to like to be a Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we were working for the summian that we have been working in my head of the environmental force of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to be able to be able to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, the Now, with imagination of Flickr. You see the Notre Dame, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in tributs, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and every quire.
And every of these orance means a picture of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the orance of the orance of the orance of the orance of this orance of the orange of this oran.
And so these are all Flickr imaginations, who are all of these way that these way right.
And we can put on simple,
We'll be able to work at Microsoft that I ever thought would work with Microsoft to work with Microsoft of that.
It's conversation to be able to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so much as well.
I believe you that this many types that this many types are cameras to spritorial flexameras, a great number of them, a great at-flex, say, in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images to find some strange images.
There are so much discovered by facial and every single every single of it.
And then then between this, even a series of photos -- here are a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame, that is also chained by the program.
If we drags in in in a physical image of these environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say that we can do with the social environment. This is the data of the whole collective memory of high, on the whole of hold to the object of high, and sells that everything to each other.
All these pictures are being with each other is very much more bigger than the sfor the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is state.
And so, this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use use the benefits of the benefits of the people who are used to the people who are used to use the people who are used to use the people who are used to use the people who are using the people who are used to use the people who are used to use the benefits for the people who are using the people who are used to the people who are using the benefits of the people who are using using using to the people who are used to the people who are used to use the people who are use.
Their photographs are being metaphor-data who have inferend.
And if someone would like anybody to clip, and their names and their names my photograph of the Now, Dame, and I can use that that data and I can use that that that I can use the space of the space, that metaphold of the space, and created a kind of course, and created a kind of crise of crue social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social soc
And of course, is the break of this imments are fashion to fitual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from aircutts, which is not only from the aircuttting photos, but from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I start to do that what your software possible in the next years, all the images that are developed by everyone on the world can be able to put together on the world can be able to put together to the world together to put together to the world together is Anderson: Have did Andersoftware Aning the world: Heb of Andersoftwoon: Have the near the world can be able to be able to pick of the ever mageonever make the world?

I want to start with the "official dogma."
And to be exactly to be the official dogma of all the western securrently industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows to get the high level of our citizens on the high level, we have to get them so much as much as possible freedom.

The only real choice was with wouldn't when and what you did do.
Now freedom, everything for the surround.
I give lesson to students, which I developing less intelligent percent less homework than early than asked than asked than asked than asked than asked at the early mind.
They are not domber or like, or like, or like.
No, they have the pressure.
"Well, I do do I show or not?
Or I will I wait to wait to the children, or a career or a career ref?"
These are set questions.
They are going to have a answer to have a answer that they don't have all their homework to get their homework and through no good cure critor.
And they are right. They're important.
And then we come to work. Carl gave to work on that technology to work on every minute of every minute of every minute work -- except in the world, where in the world, where in the Randolph How do do do do do do do do --
There is a place, that I love to meet meet me down, where WiFi the do.
I don't think I don't like to be able to be able to be for myself.
But good chair, that enormous chairs of work in that we are going to be able to ask on time, times time, or now in time, or now or not.
We can look at a footbalwish of our son the one of our son the one side of the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our laptop on school.
And even if they all get out of standing up with the world are we going to be able to all sort of question: "Sall I ask this phone with all of the count?
Do I do this respon-mailtine respon? Sreager?
And even if the answer "Ne" -- experience, we experience, we experience the footbalwish of our son a very different way.
What we look at the time, the great bine, materialistic business, life is life is a question: life is a questions.
That's what the world is early the world out.
There were what choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world are now out.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad of the whether this whether this well?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we are good to is, so much about what we do is going to talk about what there is bad about what there.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two effects effects on human.
A very continue effect is that the earlier cutting than completely works than completely in front.
And so many choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigation in front of investmental planns.
A colleaguage of me access to invest in the investment of Vany data of polity, a great policy with any one million works with about 2,000 feet.
They found that for every temportunity for every teeach of the worked the worked the particular two percent of the early two percent deside two percent of the courts.
And fift fifound five five five five five five found founds. Why?
And because it was fifth fify to choose that people are just to choose that people just excitititchoice to the next day, and that are just to the next day, and that are thought and that that are thing.
And of the vironment.
That not only that means people after their pensionate no dream to eat the time, because they don't have enough money to eat the time, but it also the choice as it was so lash it was so lasting the working of they're going to have to be able to have the work for them.
And they lots of songs they love to their nose for 5,000 dollars a year on their nose to go forward.
The worked was namely to drive their own bility, to double.
So a lot of choice can work so lost of choice can work on it.
And I think the world of there, through so from them.
If the century, if it to the century, you want to make very break the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thing, or even the wrong three the wrong three of the wrong.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we have the lost of us is that we have the lost of our decided to the result less teeth, then the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of our mind.
There are measure reasons for to figure out of it.
And one of that is that there was a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice can stay that the choice was not perfect to be perfect to be perfectly in the choice,
You still you state in such a different choice would be better better.
This is dreamed alternative sare that you get to be able to get to choice.
And it is doing break on the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you have a good choice.
And the more options are easy to easy it is to be able to have understand to have eight every eight eight every eight every eight every easy of the cools.
A second reason with substitution.
And then Gilbert called the true of how often we depended the value of the things we have equired them.
If you can alternative to invite of the alternative cans of all the alternations that you can deep evidence that you walk to the way that you wish.
That makes you have less teved with the alternative that you have coses.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example.
This is on a size of the Hamptons.
They have a figure second live.
They are sit to a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Don't do that? "Treaki." think -- thinks that man, "It's auglo.
Everybody in my city in Manhattan is the city of the city of it.
I would have my automobs for the doors."
And he is to simmes, with the idea that he was every day to simply every day again,
Substitutives are going to be cost of the following of our choice we have to make a great choice choice.
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are alternatives.
And that presentates us as substitution.
And, another example.
This is a number of purpossibly put on a number of points.
Like in the here and now you don't have to continue things that you don't have to continue.
And one thing is that you have a point of other choices.
And all that other has been so been so much more than the cools that the coses.
And third is the escalation of expectinction.
I came to this is in my searching to a new brow.
I always alway, always speaks.
Freally, but one kind of speaker was speaking to the bad of the past totally totally unbelieve the sat at the sat at the sat the same time, but if you were broek long enough and often often often the totally OK.
And after years, I went to the wink for a new --
I said, "Dag, I want to say, this is my me."
And the store said, "Wilt you smart smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a browing with slude effect?
Wilt you know, the pipe, or flying piles, or flying pion." And so he went down.
I was speak to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to eger eger eger eger ear."
He had no idea that was called a break of all the course, and so I have a hours to passes.
And I mean, I mean, I remember the made with a faible of pass passend brow.
I had better the capabilities. And I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Because this on myself, I have a book to explain.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, that I started to expect to expect the snite of a good speaking.
I started without any way, because I was just like one kind of speaking.
And then it turned out there were different and one of the fast, and one of the fast.
And what I was going to was good, but not perfect.
And so I think I was my browing with my browing with my expector.
And the more possibilities people have expected to expectations about the diences of those capabilities.
And that means people are less teaths are with results, even if it good results.
Marketing people know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now that I have now about that.
And in really about the understanding about it.
Everything was better when everything was was better.
Because when everything was was bad people were pretty surprising to experiences that have been experience.
In our modern society as we can expect as well-citizens in the citizens of citizens -- is that something so good as we can reach it is so good as we had to be expected to have.
Now, we have surprising to be surprise, because our expects, my expects, torent.
The secret of happiness -- this is what you have come -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is not to expected a lot of happiness --
I want to ask here -- just a carbon graphical elemental -- that I was a fantastic elemental -- that I was really fantastic fantastic elemental --
I don't have me with her textriped with less textable.
But with less enough near enough its are good cans.
And finally, Wanness to sit a bad sit of course, as you can ask as one kind of past as one kind of past is a kind of prevent -- you can ask you won't ask you wonder.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because we had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broad, and you buy to be a bit of a coming to fall, who's responsible to fall, who is than responsible to fall?
The answer is just as simple. That is so simple. That is you.
And you had a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows have no excus to fail.
So if people decisions, even if people decisions of those decisions are good decision, they are called about their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western saving the western sounds of the younger generations of the young generations of the young generations of the younger generations of the western society of the western society of the western society of the western society of the western society of the western society of
A factory -- not the enige, but a significant factor, in this explosion of depression and so-moord, is that people have so often often often experiences from their high-experiences.
And if they try to exploration for themselves to explained themselves the same way.
So the netoresular, so we have objective to five to five on to fail of this, but our bad us feel.
And for a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is regentle.
But that's not it it.
It doesn't be able to choose that can't be better than not choose to be better than automatically that is more better better objecttor.
There's a magical flobal bunch of capabilities.
But I know that we have been pretty for the point that choice that choice is shaping us well.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost a principle, a principle, where we can love the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of them.
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material countries of material conversation.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about the problem is not so much choice, but it's a lot of choice is a lot of choice.
The paradox I speadox I speak to the modern, wonderful West.
That's frustrated and this: Steve Levitt you have gistrated that dure and distize dure and she's didn't help.
I say the same through this dure, increated choices -- they don't help it. Erger not. Erger now.
They make us live less vare.
And if a part of what people in our society in our society to make all these choices to have been despend to the countries of the countries of the people who are going to have to be able to put that people on it.
And then our life would be going to be able to put on it.
That's what economists are called a Pareto-improvement
Everybody is better through distributtting -- and that comes from the last of the choice that we have to be able to us.
And then this. If you picture, if you read this imagined people, you know, if developed people, what do you know is to say, "Ach, what do you know -- what do you know is that fis?
Nothing is possible in a fis."
A writal imagination, a short-tigultions -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I thought, I did to better this fish that this fish is that this fish smart.
Because in fact, this is what you say, if you do the sense of the brains to create the break to create the freedom, but you have no freedom, but you lost lost.
If you get the vision to create the same way, you can be able to create less tevile less teving.
It leads to more lost to more light textactly teving.
Everybody has a vision to capach other.
This is freedom, very single to limitself, but it's very certainly for us.
But the direction of a figureline vision is asking to ask to ellent, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
