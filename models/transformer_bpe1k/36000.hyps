Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, which is three million years to be about the last three million years, about the size of the USSt, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the most second the most most of this specific problem because it doesn't showed the disection of the ice of ice.
The ice cap on the North Pole, in a climate sense of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crooms in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is cled in the preced.
As you can see, it sat down to dark blue.
That's the early ice during the winter.
And it crooms in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years or older or older, is almost like blood, which is almost like the body here.
In 25 years is this came to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen ground the North Icell Icell warms and there's a very large amount of warming carbon is frozen carbon frozen carbon methan, when it was designed in memethan.
Commous amount of response, in the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, it could double the amount of entered as we write it could conclude the corporation pully.
In some understanding in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey winter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another unedical member.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is to be real to be wrong.
A reason for that, is that this huge warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smel-faterriver.
The water than ever beyond beyond beyone.
This is the Kangerlussuail in South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea leap because the landical is because the landice where it comes in the sea.
These streams are taking flocks to them.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
Probably months scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly quickly on the south of the smelt of the same thing else islands.
The whole continent for six meters for six meters of six meters of the Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass, there are now new now, there were new now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of the global population of that mely.
In the Andes, this glater the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more pristed flows.
But when they disappeared, swines it toowater.
In California 40 percent in California 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reads, the predictions are there.
This global dred dramatic dramatic stye of forest fire.
And the number of natural raps around the world is straps with an incredible and never seen it.
Four time in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 hours of CO2 hours --
25 mian every day in our oceans, in our oceans, whatever in the Stille arean area of the Stille Ocean, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic drift of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is design of the Earth, next to 20 percent money, is the burning fossil fuels.
Oiil is a problem, and stepped is the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest exertincludes with China.
And there was a lot more stepped to build much more steps.
But we see a course.
These are the stepping carbon classed in the last carbon in the last few years and where green alternatives were proposed in the last few years.
There's a political battle on the country.
The stepping carbon and oil-industrial gave industrial gave in 250 million dollars to promote a clear cuttery clean.
And that image me to think about something like this.
And the runned the Christest became home in Tennessee, about four billion gallon gallones to be more believed to the charge.
You probably seen the news in the news of the news.
This is the one-largest fired in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the steps of the Sup, was the Kurst was the one.
Video: "Frosty the voice charge is a blank man is a while.
He is overfly, he's a bit of America, and he makes it grows in America,
Frosty the stepping carbon the day clean.
He paid and culated, and culately called their job."
Here's a big part of the stepped part of the stepped in West Virginia from the cross.
The largest mine certain of the land is the great biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Sup, Sup, "Let me clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reme, Harry Reme, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate protection two campaign campaign on touch.
This is a piece of this.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat threatence for our business.
That's the reason why the most important purpose is to give a huge to address the light of the light and letting the truth of light and letting the truth of truth and the truth of truth and leave.
Fit is, step, is not smary.
We find that it is clean -- and it is clean.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me be that but to us over.
Video: Acurate: Schone carbon cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean clean classrooms of clean.
Fantastic! The machines machines makes a little more law.
But that's the sound of clean clean to clean technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the burn of the Earth is the most important causes of the Earth, change the earth is change the earth of the Earth, change that you see here.
Look around the clean clean classed clean technology today.
Al Gore: Evirtually put the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and the area of national security of national security
Video: America is wrong crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security crisis.
The red of all these things are these bags, our dependence of fossil fuels, like polar colls, like policy collaborated oil.
But now there is a durfe, new solution to get this.
Fore America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to work America to work to the work of work, a plan that makes us safer and warming the Earth counter.
And eventually a solution which is enough to solve our problems.
Redwer America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It is to give America re-re-a-energy.
One of the fastest ways to make an endone to our dependence of old dependence of old fuel that our planet to help help.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
And then 2: New investments to create good paid to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African ancient African word says, "If you want to be able to be going to be again.
If you want to go far far away."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works machine works.
So here I again. For those who weren't be the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever experiment ever understanding in the currence.
It has to be able to cope the conditions that were less than a billion in a billion in the universe started to 600 million times a second of second in the universe of 600 million times a second of the universe
Enorm ambitiously, though.
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is what I work. It's called the ATLATLASdetector -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in continue to be able to see the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That was a party for a party camery in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that all the LHC City, and with the LHC and with the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and detector of the LHC detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture photograph at 10 September we worked the machine work, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the largest of the most right or this, or then, when somebody was looking at Google and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page.
That means we made a both of cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden carries.
They were doing 13 thousand 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power to work on full power to the engine.
The engineers are going to say, "Not what. It's too little too little dram."
They can do that because they can be superceived on whole low-temperaturs.
So at the min 271 degrees, you know, the stars, the stars, that can drags that drags that are drags better craws that are drags bears that are drags better in 271,
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was something warmed the wire of it was something warmer, and it was a little bit of 13 thousand that 13 thousand amper cheat.
This was the result.
This is more impression when you realize your realize that those magnets more than 20 tons of tons and moved about 30 centimeters.
We dealed about 50 magnets.
We had to put them out what we did.
We all have been tool-tool.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We will put it again, and we expect measures in June or June so we can go further with the except of the universe of the universe --
Now, of course, that have been unhappiness to the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research.
I think it's so hard to think it's so hard, the fact that we go further than ever beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words at the last words on the last words on the last words of Humphrey Davy, I did the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous experiments of his learning to the core of the human mind than to take the human mind than to take the human minds of the human minds of the human beings are completely definitive that our sciences are completely definitione."
Thank you.
I'd like to start to ask you back to your children to your kiddle age, when you play with blocks played in the blocks played with blocks playing to start to ask in your childhood away to start to take your childhood again.
When you discovered how to understand how to figure out and consciously problems to the realize with the dealing with and depended with and depended with and depending space relationships.
Ruimuly insight is a strong because with the world to understand the world around us.
If an information -- inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advised objects -- and my medeculture, Jee called Jee Kalanithi -- what if we were used a computer instead of the mouse of that engave engineering a kind of digital fingertiful, which is to movate a closed information that we could put up with a closing information flated information fy-breauthority information
and can orders as we want?
This question of us so being so being so we decided to look for a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Sify is a Sift is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be movement with the hand they can movement to be able to feel each other and contains and wirely contact and wireless.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded by understanding the customers of it.
And the tables are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
Because these aid are of the aid of physical different distinctions of their movement and and even then, and even of the way we movement and even then, and even set of the way we move, there are different new and fun, new and interactions and fun.
I'll start with some simple examples of the simple examples.
This Sift is to show up to show a video is to show a video is playing to play and others and others and playing the back of the back of the result of the back of the same back to the back of a single of the same and playing to show up and change cancountry and show to do cancountry to show you can't show to do cancoun
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And the next next to each other, they will be interest in each other.
If they get surrounded this and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to cup.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interaction, the use of the interact of a color as it was a liquid to a color as it was a liquid --
In this example three Siftables against and I can use them to go into a very much and I can use them color in a very empty where they are getting together.
If we have drive, we love some back.
There are some capability for education, and pretty capability to be game with language, mathematics and logics where we want to try to try to try to try and try to see things quickly, and the results to see inside the education.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic reality.
Here we show you a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a randoms at every Siftable, and shaped words are controllated in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary dictionary in every Siftable, and sincluding the principle of the course of the principle of the r
About 30 seconds is being a new series of being a new series of letters with means a new series of letters with mean.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in to try to make it and try to make it and make a video of making it and make a video of making a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need almost no instructions that people need to need instructions
Everything you have to say is "Make word." And they know what to do.
Here are some other people at the test.
That's our youngest bat, right, right, right?
And it seems that he just said the Siftable.
For him was only blocks.
Here's an interactive painting shown painting here.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
He can bring new characters in the scene of scene, by just the Sift with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun of the sun of sun.
Video: The Sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done be! Yeah!
By the scale, the shape of Siftables and the next to each others to each others -- Video: Wal!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decision how it walks away.
Video: The cates away.
DM: the last example that I'll show to show you today is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent developed a sound produces and drum.
One of a variations, where you can choose what you want to choose what you want to use.
These sound in the learn Siftables are being injected so you can detern the pattern of pattern itself as well.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a lege Sift of a leg Sift of live controlling available as reverb and filter.
They are added to a sound and advantaged and adapted by can't be counter.
And found the general effects like tempo and volume, which are pated on the entire pattern of the whole pattern
Let's look at a look at this.
Video: We're starting a lead in two Siftables, to a lead to a first pattern by a extra lead.
Now, I place the basline thing.
Video: DM: Now, I feed a little bit slower work on
Video: That's capture to the filter to the drums, so I can influence the effect of live live influence live influence
Video: I can cell it very siding by the canes of the block of the tempo block.
Video: That's now copped the filter to the basage for what more expression.
Video: I can rearn the pattern while it played the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to prefer anything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter as I want.
With it by the end, the dims of the volume Sift to the volume Sift to left left to the same left in the end.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people, my passion of new people-computer interfaces that are voted better in the way our brain and lightly works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area design area with some possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is only the same typically to a whole new generation to the interact with digital media, which media, which bringing the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from harted.
I look at it to talk to you all with you.
I'm writing away.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm going to write and I don't think that ever will change that ever going to change
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career in my life and career and career, which I had to be relationship with my work rein.
It started a book that I wrote understanding unction, a memoire, "Eten, Biddle -- that I said, "Eten, that I was very much to my first world and an international existenced the world and a international existence.
And the consequence, people all all over the time, and always have to be capable.
Do really what -- you know, does --
People come to me and ask sure to me and ask sure you can never be able to be succcess this succcess is never benefit?
Do you know that you're not afraid your whole life is write but never before you will write that people will be heating for warm where people are going to walk for warm that people will walk for warm to be walk to you,
Don't be afraid to be.
Ery away, you know, you know.
Now, of course, that would be very much that I was rather than 20 years ago, I was going to be a teenager, when I was write to write that I wanted to be write it.
People said, "You don't you afraid you never get succcess?
Don't afraid for deeply to be able to go through through through through it.
Don't afraid you live to this work on this work without that there is anything from the putting and you will deep in your broken droams with your broken with your mouth broken with your bitters of bitters of biter?"
Something in that strets.
In the short, my answer to the short, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things that are called the things that are called
Always the time.
But I'm also much other things that you know for a lot of other things that for all of it.
For sea leg, for example, and other singdom.
But what is write to write myself where the last time that comes fear where fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody is to be afraid to be afraid to be able to work for the work for their opinion on on Earth are soil?
What is so particularly so particularly that we make sure to creative processes that we made the effects of mind work on the minds, something that is not happened to happens to be able to do it.
Take my father. He was a father. He was a chemistry, and I can't remember that in the 40 years that he was working in the 40 years that he didn't have been afraid to him.
And so said, "John, how is it to your chemistry blockade?"
No, it didn't be talked about it.
To be fair fair fair engineers have been doing the eters of the eters of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists for manicalcoholists
Scheed, that have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have happened the reputation mental reputation mental reputation of being instable.
Look at the grimal death of the most magnificant creative minds of the 200th century.
Many died young, often by self-typical doing
And even those who are not suicide no suicide to be faith, under their gave cup.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meiler Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself away."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But from this kind of speaking out of this kind of thing we don't look at any more.
We all heard it every before, and we have it all with a sources all accepted it.
The same thought is that creativity to unlock of unlocks and connected that is going to lead to suffering is going to lead to ellence.
And so I want to ask everybody here today, can you with that idea live, you can live that idea life?
Finds you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think it doesn't have pretty pretty cumb.
I find it reflected.
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see that this century is this century.
We can creative minds much better to live better to live better to live better
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, would be dangerous to live to that dark thought of the dark thought would be dark to that dark thought of me,
See seen the fase where my career now is now in.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper resources.
I can work for four decade for four decades.
Heye probably will be seen now is going to be seen now by the outside world as the work that extraordinary succcessful book.
We're friends up with friends up under each other, so I can failed my largest succcess for all behind me.
Yem, what a idea!
If you go to think, you're going to be like to think of the morning to need in the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to be that.
I love to love me work where I love with the work where I love to love it.
The question is: "Hoo?"
After long thinking about the conclusion I can go to the conclusion when I can write a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process.
I have to see a safe distance safe distance between myself and my overbody is very understanding for the response to my future publications.
I've looked at ways been looking for ways to ways to ways do that.
I am in the history and have floored me depends in other societies to see if others may have found a better ways to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My quareas showed me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let away, because it's a long and complicated.
In the old of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was coming from hundanger.
And they believed that creativity was a good mind was a good mind, which was a benefit was a lot of mind and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks called these tremendous minds of creativity of creativity "demonen."
Socrates believed he had a demon who had a demon who had a word him to influence.
The Romeins had a kind of right idea.
And in the called a called a geniused to be a genius.
The funny is that the Roman is not a particularly pient, piently pientist of clear.
In their polar was a genius, a kind of magical diview of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the worst of the work was work, put assistence.
And he gave shape he works form to work.
Brilliant to be exactly the distance that I had the first away, the psychological protection to the results of work.
Everybody knew how to work in his work was going to be work.
The artist, in protection was taken so in protection to for example,
If you were working brilliant there, you got not all the every ear.
Everybody knew that a means that a invisible genius,
Well, you know, you crowd up being came in, it not just to you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genius.
Long time, that had been considered how to the West, creativity was considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be the West.
Then came the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human universe and the state of the universe and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, sent from the divile of the divile world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity was completely came from the individual came from the individual
And for the first time in history was about artists of artists said that they were a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big again.
To one person, one person, one to single individual individual is that he or she or she saves the course of the century, the source of the century, of everything is -- it is to be a lot of responsibility for a fragility for a fragy mental mental human psyche.
Anybody asks somebody in the sun in slight.
Egos are blows to huge proportions and there are unimaginable to express expressions, and exprestations to exprestations to expressed.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists made a lot of artists made a lot of artists of artists made a lot of artists of artists of the last 500 years of artists are cape caps of artists that has made a lot of artists made a lot of artists of ar
If that, and I think that, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back to a parenent understanding of the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can not be unctioned 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably there are in the audience people who have read ready tools have trial scientific directly the idea that elphysics of the work of artists of artists to inspirate the work of artists to inspirating heights to inspirate.
It doesn't seem to be getting you all of that.
And yet me ask it away.
Why not?
Why would we have to do that thought to be follow?
And it came up as much as much as all the other explanations of the total explanations of the totally closely that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something has -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, in fact, all the creative performance of the creative performance of behave.
That sometimes it sometimes it feels of paranormal.
I've meeting the great American closer Ruth Stone meet.
She's going to be in the nined. Her whole life all lives around the close.
She told me about her jught on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was work, she was work, she heard a close of close close of close,
It was so said, she said, as if there was a big golf showed came to came air.
And so, poem poem golf than the country to her
She felt that the ground under her feet, and knew that shake her to shake that point to do is just one thing to do is standing for her life.
She found home, back through the close and she had to see so quickly as quickly as quickly and package.
When the close through her her came to write was that her only chance to write it was to writing it in the close of of it.
Sometimes it wasn't quickly enough.
Then and run, but it doesn't reached the house.
And at the moments her hundred by her her hus, disappears -- in her words -- in her words -- to another close -- to another closer -- to another closer --
And also there were some of the story -- I think it was the beautiful part of the story -- that she close the close -- that she close to almost mistake.
And then she was in the house and paper and paper pended up and pended by her home.
Juist at that point she had a pencily of pencil.
And with her other hand, she was so told me she picked the close of the sky.
She picked the close of his tail, and pulled it back in her body again.
In those closes came up with the close of paper in the close of paper -- but then in the close.
When I heard that, I thought -- what happens to be able to close to be my creative process of course.
And so my creative process of works not! I'm not medium!
I'm a micle, who are every day on the same time, and sweating up with blood, sweating and with blood, sweating and trans through it sweats and transmitted around and trans and blow.
But even in that day I had had been every day I had suddenly ever had an experience.
You also know it will be knowledge that feeling that feeling that feeling that there are creative ideas in your course relative to be able to identified in a source that you can identify it as well.
What is that they brone?
How can we use the without we have to be able to be used to be cut?
At a way that we have good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think I can think I have a musician example of the course contemporain
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way it this.
And in fact, in fact, a large part of his life has been showed the showed of the same way from all power to the power of power to the unitial impact on the unitial impulses that in him.
With the 1990s Tom a little bit of smell
And one day he reflect in Los Angeles about the speeaway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was so got this showed a fragmental of a gmental of a gment.
It decided to him, like inspiration that it does it does understand it.
It was a nice good and he wanted to hold it it was to hold the hold.
But it wasn't that way.
He had no paper top, no paper -- no taper, no tany of them.
The amazing exciting exciting excited to him the melody -- I got the melody -- and then it turns me eught to be eught follow.
I'm not good enough, I can't am it.
He didn't real panics, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up, to the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the wall?"
"Do you really know that I can write a song of you can write a song
If you really want to cut that song you have to be another any classed when I have time for you.
Now, you know, somebody else -- you know, somebody else fall.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohent." And from that moment --
The work itself is the same, with the same thing that is known underto.
But the sware spaning that the creative percent of the engineered in him away when he distanced the engineering of engineering the engineering of engineering in the engineering of engineering that the creative percent of engin
The genius sat the skin and listed only and listed only in the skin and it just away.
Tom realized that there was no realized to go to through through through to go through through this.
It could be a wonderful, bizarre society between a kind of conversation between Tom and the owners that wasn't quite allow to Tom himself was not quite as well.
That story has changed my way of works.
I've had been a bit of agreed.
I was writing in the writing of Eten, Biddle, in.
And at a cutting point in despair.
You know that well, you want to work -- you know, you know, you know, you know, it is a terrible disast. The book is book of it.
Not soment, really horrible bad of bad bad.
I wanted to do it all the project all the project.
And then I remembered Tom that said, Tom that wise, and I decided to be a point to be a point to be a point to be a point to be a point to be wish.
I wish my manuscript and founded to me to a lew to a legal corner of the room of the room of the room of camery
And I said, "Listen then, we know all this, we know all this, if this book is not just through this book, it's not just by me.
You can see that I have in all of it.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it need better can, you have to come your thing --
Do you know that? Those you don't know that, understanding it.
I just write do, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notor, and in the nots. That's going to be able to be different."
Tja--- I mean, it comes here, it comes here,
Euwing ago, in the North African desert of desert people to dance together to dance to dance in the sacle music.
and hours and hours and hours to the morning,
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes very much happened to be a particular this.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean to be able to see in the way that you can also be in a performer.
It was like the time and dance of the time and dance through a paper stack on a pate.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights for thousands of nights together.
He suddenly did not longer only a human being.

Really, souldy, souldn't see a glimpse of God.
Pections what we need it.
Lastonly is that the dance of the next morning at morning the next morning to the universe is not a good charge of the morning to the morning of the morning to the morning.
At that moment is he against a little elder, with designs that may never before that may never before to be able to come to such high high h highs.
Maybe never more anybody God set anybody during his dance.
What does he have to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to square to square for a creative mind.
But so painful need to be so painful as well.
Imagine you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person common from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have a while, you know, let's just put them a while,
When you are ready with it.
That's what it is to considered everything.
I high inside the thought of thought to be in the minute.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside is going to be different to be seen in a lot of reach that is to long in the last month.

If my mind with me the hall, I hold me to go and hold the same for: Don't be fright.
Do just your work.
Don't do you do, which is it is.
If you can took a task you very much for then.
If the goddary entirely to decision to decision to work at your work at anything of the wonderful sources by lone, then "Ollet lon!"
That's not happening, dance then, then, but then, then,
And then, "Ol!
I believe that I believe this.
"Ole !" anyway, because we pure human love and property wallowed and went and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and discovered new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were actually going to be the digitize of digits, and now we were trying to go from that digital code to a new phase, to design the design and synthetic design and synthetic design and synthetic lives.
So we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is life?" And what I think is something that I tried to understand in different levels to different levels in different levels in different levels
We tried different approach approach to minimum components.
We're now almost 20 years of the digitize of digitization.
When we have sequence, the human genome sequence, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask for the question: do we live to live new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of a laboratory that can multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at a nice to look at a nonce of smaller genome.
We can generate in the order of the 500 or anything from the 500 or anything that are there are around
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relative relative simple.
For me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at per piece of the genes that we can probably that this would be a living cell cell that would live cell to live cellent.
We decided that the only route condition was to ask this chromosome, this chromosome of the components to synthetic so that we could make the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions as well, Can we started a chromosome, "Can we have a chromosome of synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic questions, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we started a chromosome of synthetic synthetic mosome of synthetic synthetic mosome of the syn
Stails the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, can start a chromosome,
A chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemistic iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitize of life is accelerating exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code, but is a lot of slowly slowly --
And our last point would be places at this exponential curve.
We are started over 15 years ago.
There were some of the stage, for needs to start with a bio-ethical true of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little bits of DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make, the more than there.
So we had to put a new method for the together of these little pieces and the corrates and corrates all the phrase.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that death.
We designed the pieces of the bits,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the bacteria of chemical stopped chemical stopped in the bacteria closed the genetic code and viral particles went to make and viral particles --
The viral particles were leaving the cells, they were out of the cells, they came back and deaths and death, the E. coli.
I was until I was conversation with the oil, and I said that she was just too good fairly nast.
They laughing over you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software o-software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to be much biggers.
We wanted to build the ential chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could virus, so we could variance the cassettes --
to understand what the characters are components of a living cell cell area of cell cell area of cell cell --
The design is critical information in the computer than digital information in the computer than that has to be very accurap.
When we first first came to the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 baseparates.
And finally, we found the resequency 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence of the original sequency was not to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to star
And the design of the design is the design of the design of that 50 letters are long that have to conduct 50 letters to do 50 letters to build so that they can design so they can design so that they can design so that they can design so they can go to design so that they can be able to design so that they can be able to design so that they can be able to design so that they
We design unique unique of the unique parts of the unique of the unique of this.
Maybe you read to be in the stopped in stopps.
There is a cure gene of this: we have a square genetic code: A, C, Go's and T.
Trios of those letters crossed for 20 aminoffer -- that there is a long shaped sources for every amino-sources for every amino-sourselves in the course of the letters of those letters of codes -- that letters are codes of the letters of codes for equival.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
We just called the currently called "me"
Some of them were curged that there were no poems were not close.
We have designed these pieces of the designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and they put in each other.
And we started to make pieces of them and start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters five to 7,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, take up to 72,0000.
In every stage, we could cut a flow of these pieces of these pieces so we could sequences a process because we want to create a process that is very robust.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this is looking like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 baseparate baseparate -- then they don't grow up to E.
That is the exercise of all modern tools of modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to raisming up with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists is called "homology to repair by the biology to repapers, that pieces together to repair and squeive.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million rad rad to rad the same thing to be on the opportunity.
You can see that in the upper panel, she clear clear cutting clear from each other.
12 hours later, he put it again, exactly as it was first like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be this.
These organisms can be completely dried up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can life in the space, that can exist in the space, that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has showed showing that there is a lot of of this, there.
Here's a real microphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually just gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces where we were in it.
Gist makes them to be automatically concerned automatically
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a non-cope photograph.
It's such a large molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish we expected incentive.
This is over 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-molecule.
If we would pressed it with a 10-points letter, no speeds, there is 142 pages pages only to pressure, only to press the genetic code away.
And, how do we start a chromosome, how do we activate it?
With a virus is the clear cutter.
With a bacterium is much more complicated.
It's also simpleer if you put under eukaryots, as we just cell it dows and does another in, and that's what you know if it clones.
And in the bacteria species of the bacteria of integrated in the cel, but we have showed that we have a complete transplant transplant to a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another, and can activate it and and it can activate a whole cell in the cell.
We have a chromosome. We have a chromosome.
These are about so far as far from each other as people and mously mously away as people and mously mously as far as people and mice.
We add some of genes so that we could take a chromosome, for this chromosome.
We have been teached with enzymes to make all the protes to make all the protein of the edges of the enzymes to make all the protein all of the protein of the protein of the enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzymes to enzyms to enzymes to make all the protein all the protein of the protein of the protein of the proteteteteteteteteted.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be able to capture the very advanced graphical images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to be only to square to developing the process of developing what we came to develop further and developed it beyond to develop further and eventually further to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all sorts of discovered a second chromosome, or a third of chromosome, or a third of thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who proposed evolution to evolve equal change in the same time, not a lot of biology commity.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that actually called DNA.
The chromosome, the chromosome, there was not every one.
The cell -- the chromosome, the chromosome, well,
It was expressed, and it was recognized the other chromosome, and it was a strange material, and therefore, and therefore, and then finally the cell of the new chromosome of the cell of the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the one of the species of the one of the new species, and software that we had in the new species,
All the membranes changed the membrans changed -- when we were read the genetic code was changed.
This is a maslinks like genomical chemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental -- to change things
And, I've been paying to be a little bit of the Camborn -- this is a break -- this is a 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have paid that we may be able to be able to be able to be a new version of the Cambrand new species where there are large scale, and based on this digital design on this digital design on this digital design on this digital design on this digital design --
Why would you do?
And I think it's pretty clear when you look at what it is clearly when you look at what it is.
We're going to be short from six and a half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for each of us that in 1946; within 19460 years.
We have a lot of food, with the clean water, medicine, with the burn of the six of the six of the six-en-and a half billion.
And that is last to do that.
We use five billion tons of colleges, more than 30 billion ts.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the any of course, or anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, all of the cool dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is of the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere to the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the
And though our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see when the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity that come out of the diversity that comes out of the electronics and look at the diversity that is comfortune that has come out of the diversity that is comes out of the diversity that has come out of the electronics that has come out of the diversity that had been there.
We are presently limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have this technology is what we call these technologies to be called combination to do so-called combination genomics genomics.
We have the capability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the curating of 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to make octan, or to produce octan, new vaccins, we can change with a little bit more molecular biology to change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for livity, chemical or fuel, vaccine, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design design software where we work on the global design and a new species on the computer can design a new species on the computer can design in the computer design --
We don't know how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of their genetic code
We focus on the fourth generation of fuel fuels.
One of you see the grand ethanol of ethanol is a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come inside comes from inside comes from the cross-fire, to more fuel fuel of the butanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology biology without the food price of the food price and the available prize is as we start to reduce as we start with CO2 as his food subject design that way, and we think that we are couldn't design the first foot in the way that we can fix fuel inside the first generation of 18 makes insive fuel 18 months.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 196.
It lives in the deep sea and a half miles eters deep in cooking, it cooks,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water from molecular water as energy source.
We are looking at the case or we can take CO2 -- which is easy via pipeled via pipeled through that CO2 is case to fuel this process.
So in a short time, we think we are able to expand we think we are able to break out of the basic question: What is life?"
We have real, you know, -- you know, the currently industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED can do this, where there's a lot of TED.
A important energy sources.
But we also work on the tools of these tools to think of these tools to think of vaccines of these tools.
This year was the flu was flu always just behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making a shapes of combined vaccines.
Here's how you can see how the future is going to be able to see that the evolution is going to change now, the accelerating of synthetic bacteria and eventually purched, and eventually eventually evolution eventually eukaryota.
We are removed from the improvement of the improvement of people.
Our goal is to assure, we can make a chance to survive that we can make a chance to survive that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is fundament of a new technology that we have to go to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment where you local or at the immense amounts of visual data can work on the way that can work on it.
We look at this here many gigabyts, and can be able to keep in the room of digital images and made the sort of wish, and the sort of wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the time.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapix.
It all does it all because the only thing would be influence to influence, on a subject on a subject in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of the picture of data.
This is the graute of Dickens. Every column.
To prove that it is really text to be really text in and not picture, we can do something like this, to show that this is really not imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read a book.
I wouldn't care of it.
This is a realistically example. This is an example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a subject of a subject
This is really the pleasant and experience of a real paper of a real paper or capital is actually a scaling medium.
We also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have made a nep advertise of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertised.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you want to see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really sure that we can really make the constraints of across the screen of accessions.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more means and other thing.
Of course, of country to the hand maps for a technology as this as a technology like this, I will not spending to this field -- except that we can also contribute this field available to this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And put up the picture of the NASA .
Let's look at something else.
This is married live on the Web, you can look at the Web,
This is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Snaively, promoved-Snavely, promoved by Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Stitz at University is a very beautifully through of Washington, and the University of Washington, and it's a way of We're sho
and Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images of the images has meaning.
The computer vision mes have been picture of these images have been closed with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadiasws -- where they are genomes of stabilized diasws or panorama and panorama and pances, and all these things are spaceds, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is a certainly time --
There are much more space.
I want to like to be a Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth synth -- to be working on the communicate of the communicate of the communics of this technique, in the world is power of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to love the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames with images from Flickr. You just just in Flickr, and you get pictures of people in t-shirts, and you get pictures of people in t-shirts, and the campus and subject.
And every of these orange kept in the last time that was a picture that part of this model of model of this model in the model of this model in the model of the every single of the every single of the orange of the orange of the every single of the every of the every of the orange of the every single of the every of the orange of the orange of the orange of the every single of the every single of these orange of the orange of the every single of the part of this models of the part
And so this is all of Flickr pickr that are bully, in this way.
And we can close simple point of capture.
You know, I had never thought I would ever work at Microsoft would work at Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of me.
It's considered to be like this.
I believe that these are many typically cameras are cameras are cameras are good cameras, a big number of basically excess in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much covered by fact, and such the side of the faces and such it.
See between this, even a series of pictures -- here's a series of pictures -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dealso that is goodged by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do things with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of how to do -- and copy the Earth -- and copped everything to each other.
And all these pictures are connected to each other, and shapes a very larger than the somers of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the Earth of the earth of the Earth of the earth of the earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth is the earth of the whole Earth is the earth of the whole Earth of the earth of the Earth of the Earth is in the entire Earth.
See this as a connection on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use, and value to the benefits for the people who used it.
Their own photographs are being metaphor.
If somebody would like to click all these sacres and their names and their names and then my names with all of the Notre Deametaps with all of that data, and I can use as a access to that space, which metaph, which metaphold of all these photographs, and create a kind of cross-mods, and create a kind of cross-cross-experience.
And of course, the age product of this immense rich model of this immense of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just just from the plane photographs, satellites and other pictures and other passes, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, at the next years, all the images that are shared by everybody on the world can buy on the world together to buy together to the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this is really does discovered.
The create of creates between your wishyperlinks between images.
And the basis of the data in the image.
And that is designed when you think about the rich, when you think about the riches of semantic information that is a lot about the images of these images of images to be available to be available to the rich.
When you look for the web and searches you search a search, and the text of the web, and the text of the Webpage of information about what the image of the image.
What if you couple of your image is to all your image?
And then the number of semantions and the amount of semantic connections and the amount of room that comes from that. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable.
One of the intense pleasure of research and of eating research is the possibility to live between them, who are not forget to be forget to forget their past, who are not feeling their past, the same in by results in responsible stances in bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still prepent in the Melky Way, or that the myths of Instantly another with meaning to the Himalaya boodhist of the Himalaya boodhist on the bood-hunt clear really, remember dology in the anthropology in the world in which we live in a absolute sings, but is not a absolute single moded in a absolute of the world of the work
the consequences of a long set of adaptancestors that made our ancestors ago.
Naturally, we all share the same applicate, we all share the same adap: Worlth.
We all makes all the intransmites thrites.
And so, with the universary distinction by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all singles, dances and art have dance.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Whether this is to be in the wolden at Borneo, or the Voo-A-A-Borneo, or the Sahara.
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learn us all that we can be differently, differently, differently in the Earth origins.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope to be able to give you hope.
And together the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the planet and for her just as the biosphere.
This cultural lives sweb you can imagine as a cattack physical life.
The corporates you can defined as the total of all the total of all the corrects, dreams, ideas and inspirations that are consciously inspirations that are consciousness the beginning of our consciousness.
The corn is the great nalatence of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be able to be astonishing curious curiously species.
like the biosphere is slight is the corporated is that ever -- and in much larger mate.
No biologist would be driven that would be least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of extinction is not true.
And the right thing that is the most apocalyptic scenario comes doesn't even come in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicated to languages.
And then everybody here was born born of born of these born languages on Earth --
A language is more than her word or her grammatic rules.
A language is a click of the human soul.
It's the vehicle of which is the soul of culture the material world.
Every language is an ageous mind walk and a disconception, a county, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
From those six thousand languages today the day of that doesn't have kidnormous fluence.
They are not be babies aware not learned babies around
Effective means that, unless a change that they are dead.
Is there something that is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the last of your people, the last of your people, not have the last of the cancestors by giving the wisdom of the children or the promise of the children has to be able to see the kids of the children?
Pections that terrifice is somebody at the time, every two weeks of weeks in the Earth, because every two weeks die, and with him the last literal and with him the last literal letter-last language.
Some of you say, "Would be not be better place if we all all the world are the same language of the world -- I say, "Super, let's say, "Super, Kantone."
Or Kogi." You can realize how it would be not be able to speak how it would be not to be your own language
So what I really want to do is take you today is to take you on a short journey is to sketches a little bit of what is lost in fact, in fact,
Many of us forget that when I talk about a different way of being a different way of being a different ways.
Take this Barasana child in the North West Amazon, the anaconda, the anaconda, the anaconda, that believes that she believes the melk of the east in the brain, in the brain, in the brain.
This is a people, cognitive the colors blue and green and not supdistinguish, because it was great, the amazing of the sky of the oerwonderful of the off.
They have a set of language of the rule, which is linguistic example, which is called somebody says, you have to married somebody who speak a different language of speak to another language that speak a different language of the called language of the linguist of language, you have to called a different language of called you
This has been crops in the mythological past, but the extraordinary full in their homes, where six or seven talks about seven talks about seven talks, but you never heard a language of languages.
They simply simply and start to speak and start to speak.
One of the fascinated tribes I trived to which is the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a bluffensive in 1958 privated contacted to be contacted in 1958 period.
In 1957, five missionariss, five missionariss, but they made a critical phore.
And the sky of the air of pictures of themselves with our ideas, where they go to our idea's friendly -- where they never go to a two-dimensional picture.
They pictures the pictures and tried to find the form behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the form behind the form behind the photographs and tried to find the form behind the photographs and shaped the form behind the form behind the form behind the face.
When they found nothing they found that the during thup, they were able to this.
But the Waorani doesn't only extensions, but also each other.
Fiftile percent of their death came from through breakthrough came up
We could generalogies to eight generations to eight generations to eight generations that we could found two close of a natural death of a natural death generations,
When we went down, they gave that one man ever died that one man ever died from olderdom to died, and then he was just through it was just a surface, but at the same time, in the same time they had a surprise of the own.
Their hunters could be able to passes in 40 passmells and tell what animal species of it was --
Begin 1980s I got a bluffing a base of the power of my professor me, I would go to Hain to Hain to infill genome genome to infile genomes that shapes the power of the power of power of president Duvalers as well-safe ecorps and so it safelitorps that made out of succcceed.
To be able to understand what could understand what to understand something about this particularly believe about this particularly believe, that no cults is that not a cult of black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical world-image, very interesting.
Would I call the great global religions, what would you call say well, what would you say w?
Christiand, islam, booddhism, booddhism, and c.
One continent is always outside of the attack of the assummed that Africa didn't believe the Sahara didn't believe had believe had a religious believe.
Voodo is simply the destences of this device of religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora in the tragic diaspora at the tragic diaspora of the slavery.
What foodoo interesting is so interesting is living between the lives and death.
The lives bars are the mind.
The minds can be cously corporated to be under the Great Water, answered to the dance of living time, the soul of living time, so that during the soul of the lives of the following is to be done in the follow.
And that's why food-airs say "You're going to be able to talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you're so basically accessed by the mind, what can you happen?

And at this point is the intuition is very important.
If we think about indigence, and landscape, we often think about Rousseau and the old fabulous of the epartal wanted to full the epartness of the epartness of the edge.

Interesting is the metaphor that the keeping defines between the individual and the natural world.
I've grown up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forest capital forests there were to be capital.
And that made me another human than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forest are the lives of Kuxwells are the living and the Kromme Snavel of the Hmel and the Kromme Snavel and the change of the world's world d-business.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-in-hundanger.

It's a picture I agree in the North Amazon-Amazone nam.
This is ayaage ca, the most powerful psychoactive reaches from the repertoire of the shaman.

And that put your nose, is when you realized in a barots, shot clothing, to countries with barokay, to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not design distribution of the reality; it design depends of the reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who discovered the psychedge of psychedal ages in Mexico in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s
I mean, that these tryptamines don't be identificate as hallucinated as hallucinated to the hallucinated to experience the hallucination.

The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, which means use." What does that means data -- the Cofan, 17 variants of ayahuasca, who could identify all the great distance of ayage distance of ayam would be the cup.
If you ask their taxonomy in the course of map, they say, "I thought you knew something of plants -- I thought you knew something of plants

And it turns out all the 17 species in a night at the full moon in different totally in different today.
You don't promotes to Harvard, but it's a piece of boot countly count of books.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even those sympaths are indigences are contemporary and colorable, they look like curious and showed to a footness, but too, until the real world, means as the real world, meaning our world, means in the history of our world, consider.
The truth is that the 20th century is not remembered to be remembered to be the war or technological innovations, but as the time we were involved in which we were stunning them to the mass the mass destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem doesn't change the problem on the planet. The problem isn't change the problem change.
All the cultures have always part of a dance with new life possibilities.
And technology is not the problem is the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Sioux, when they gave their pile, when they gave, when they gave, as the Americans Americans stopped Americans when they gave.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the country to threat. It's power.

What you look at the world, you will notice that it doesn't be the lock of these cultures to away.

Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains that I do a lot of research, you can see the write of political government.
Genocide, the physical expensive of a people, universal result, but the destruction of life is not just a restributed not only not just caused not only not to cause but is in many areas in a development of development of a development strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain, until you get on the basic level level.
I have a young colleague in a 9,000 miles about country of Chength in West China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa me, I started to be able to see it behind the statistics where you heard about it.
6,000 Hily monuments, 1.2 million people death during during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And in the basis of that he was death when the Chinese invasion started.
His unclear with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are the people to in Nepal broad.
His mother was dangered because she was rich because she was rich --
He was the prison smoky when he was two -- he was away under her rock, because she didn't have without under him without she couldn't without him as well.
The sister that was so found so based in a classion was in a camp.
And one day they got a day poor per unhappiness on a Mao. For this overpene-she was seven years of desperated for seven years of ago.
The pain of Tibet can be understanding of the mind of the people, but the case of the people.
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Do we have a gray world of unigness life or want to live a colorrich world of diversity of diversity in the catal world?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said she was that she did she said she was a general me, amoring global picture moves.
We wouldn't only see the human imagination is being a smal, modl thinkcam, but we would be agreed and forget forgetting and forget forged to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see
We can feel our nederstand feel that our species of the idea that our species is about 150,0000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we got our far, where we gave our overgave on the cult of the same time, when the poetry was replaced by the proza of the priests and we should be concerned by specialization and came up by specialization, only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
These surface history is not the idea that we will not be the idea that we have all the answers of the answers of all the answers of the corporate millennia on our path.
If the only cultures of the world to be asked to humans are asked to be asked to 10,000 different votes of the world of age against 10,000 different vots.
And it is that we have to discover the capability to be discover to be what we are, a whole species, which is a full species, that all of the globs and all the gardens of garbits and all the gardens of optimism.
This picture is I got to the north point of Baffin Island taken with Invent when I went with Invarious at narrow.
This guy -- Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inva's 1950s they were going to be put our supon in the 1950s, in nederstanding in neds.
The opa of Olayuk to go.
The family of his life and received for his life and receipans, all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Indidn't be fright?
The glist of their became dropped in their booms of fish in chariboomed of fish in charibood.
Olayuks up not afraid for the polar night or the storm that was windown.
He went outside of a hundred skin his hundresult of skin his hands. And when the population started to freezing, he came up with the leame.
He brought a lot of speekse, he put on the side of the mess.
When it was sled a dog me.
He did the dog and improvised a hearnas.

He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice foops and poops.
And then, with nothing around with nothing around with nothing around in many way, symbol for the West, and all increase in the world.
In 19999 gave the Canadian government government the entire country to be back a piece of country and Texas Texas so, and Texas sinade. It's called Nunavut.
It's independents. They are all the ground-stockps.
It's a blued, example of how a nation of how a national state enough to her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clear to this is clear to these hits for who's hused to these hands of the world is not required very much more than away.
They're somebody else land.
They are passing the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us will be the dreams of these children, just as that are the unction, part of a break of the hop.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extending the politicians of the idea that politicians never achieve.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemics not convince, but we believe that stories can change the world, which we probably the world, which we probably the best of the world, we probably the best 35 million times a month countries on TV and went into the countries on TV and our magazine public public public public public countries of public countries of the world,
We make a lot of traveling to travels to the eat, with our audience, with our audience, to the such cultural places, where the toescher cutting in which the concerned by what he sight, so that hopefully the most important opens to live the anthropology will go to live in different the world in difference in difference in difference in different and in a multural and plure in a multural plure and life and plure in a multural plurb.
where all the wisdom can contribute to our behaviors well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the questions that I decided to recently deceed.
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain that you may be connecting to you may be mistry.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the Western seeing society.
And that official dogma dogma like this: To the avails of our citizens on the highest level, we need to get so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good corre, a essential part of the human existence.
And then freedom is freedom to act our own insight, to account to account a higher prosperating to this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
Morchoices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more prosperatically wonderful more prospers.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be during in our doubt would be doubt in our doubt of doubt that nobody would be doubt of age.
And in our lives in our lives in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermart. A mediumulate.
Seating about thressing.
Because 175 can-hun-classion of my supermarkets are in my supermarkets, extra-virgin olisfoil and different balso,
And that you can make a number of dressings makes a case of the 175 species between 175 species for you.
So that's the privial of my supermarket.
Look at the electronics -- you can imagine a stroneoset of stroneoset -- loud speler, cassettespecially game polar peler, cassettal peler, radio, radio,
And the ones of the electronics you can choose out of this capture of language.
You can be several six and a half million different systems with the systems of that share with the benefity.
Give to take -- you have a lot of time.
Against another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago, you could call sorts of phone services -- but only at Ma Bell.
You wouldn't cryed it away.
That had the benefit was advantage that it was never going to be able to be able to piece of it.
That time is passed in the time.
Today there are a lot of different sticks.
And the cell cell phones is the diversity is immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- with mid-3-player, nose, nose, and crer cry-bury cry-burn.
Wellight has not seen this model in the store of the store, but you can certain of that that happens is happened.
And the consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a copen that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attack of stuff, is this explosive increase a feet.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. inhigh in the U.S. -- and that you tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do And, we can do it.
Against this piece and nase.
And what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Drically, what does you?"
And the doctor, "Another has this forest, and the course has this front -- and nase.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dickter, if you was me -- what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm nothis."
And we call that "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact that the heavy of decision of decision of things -- the doctor -- to a seemed -- to a seemed -- to a seemed -- to a seemed and not the best condition to decisions -- the patients. For at recept on recept -- the patient. For on recept capable of means is a lot of capable of capture.
Good considered sleep, because the goal, because the purpose, you can't buy and I ad, you can't buy it.
Why makes it makes you can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to call the next morning our doctor to ask that other markay.
Our identity, yet a common aspect of us existence, now is now considered to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is solutely of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want.
Every morning to the opposite in the way, you have to think what for person you want to be in the person you want to be
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that freets in a time that you were going to be able to cut out of the way that you can be so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quick
The only real choice was with why, not when and what you did and what you did did you have a lot of business.
Now, you know, now is freeking everything for the opens.
I want to give lesson intelligent students, which I would have 20 percent less house, less house.
They are not dominating it in the way, or let me be in the way.
No, they have makes to make choices.
"Well, you know, I say, whether I marry now?
Or I will wait for that? Take I first first children, or a career or a career re?"
These are all disturbing questions.
They are going to have an answer to have an answer to be able to get their homework and there's no good number of their homework and failable to put it up to a bit of their homework.
And they have right. It's the important life questions.
And then we come to work. Carl gave as a lot of that technology to work at least every minute to work in every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a single place, which I love secret in the way.
I don't mean because I want to love to hold that place for me.
But anyway, that huge choice freedom choice of work in that we are going to work on the time, or now, whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a football of our son the son of our son the one side, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry to the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all all of standing, you know, we care of all minute from that competition of that competition with all sorts of question?
Do I agered this emailt respond? Well, I write letter?"
And even if the answer was, "Ne" is experience we experience the football of the son a very different way.
What we look at the big, the group, the small, materialistic bags, lifestyle: life is a question of choose.
And so saw the world early looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now is looking like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of course?
And the answer is: "Yes."
We all know what good is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
And the huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects,
A very opposed is that it is a very honestly works before than completely than a burbance.
With so many choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice
I'll give you a very dramatically example of investigations in volunteer plants in volunteers.
A colleaguary of me got access to invest to invest data from Vanguard, a big polical society with about one million works, about one million worknemers about 2,000 vestments.
She discovered that for every 10 percent funds that worknail the worker boxes that are breakable two percent percent of the two percent percent of the same two percent of the worker of the deal of the worker bow.
Fifty funds did 10 percent less employees are less works, with five fundress. Why?
Because it in fifty funds so difficult to choose that people just choice to the next day and the next day, and that are doing there, and so on that, and so on that.
And from expensive comes away from the off.
That means not only that people after their pensioner pensioned to eat because they don't have a dream for eating money, but also the choice of choice as she was so difficult to have to shoot it was working for them to shoot them to shoot them to shoot them to shoot the work of the pensioner of the pensioner read that they were down to eat the
And they went to that, they salive to their nose.
The worker was prepared to double their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute contribute to double their own contribute contribute their own contribute to double their own contribute their own
So the To much choice can work lots of choice can work on a lot of choice
And I think the world in this is looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make very love to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong with the wrong drawed fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our lamble of our dishes and choose and choose ends, finally less tevily the result of the result of the result of the case of the less of the case of the case of us as we had less options as we had less options as well.
There are multiple reasons for that.
And one of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice can't keep the choice was not perfect perfect of the choice.
You can imagine in such a case for that would have been better better would be better to be better in a different choice would have been better to be better in such a case of other choice would have been better to be better better of that would have been better better in such a case of other choice would have been better to be better to be better to be better to be better in su
This is a care of alternative sile that you get to your choice to your choice.
And speaks to the fully of the choice of the choice that you made a good choice that you made a good choice.
And the more options there are more option. And it's easier to have to be speak to early the element of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course.
Second reason of substitution costs.
And then Gilbert gave from morning to how often the value of things we are applicated to the things we compared them.
If you can think of the alternatives of all alternatives all the attractives of all the alternatives that you went to walk you very quickly went to them.
That makes you have less tevalency with the alternative that you have chose to the alternative that you chose
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example of example.
This is in the Hampt of the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second a dread.
They are sat a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Don't be able to do it? "Take class -- it's a gust.
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is the city of the city of this.
I could class my car for the door."
And he is there two weeks to simmen, with the idea that he was a great parking a great parking place correctly and missioned a great parking again.
Substitution cost of the entire cost of the entire we have to have from our choice, even if we makes a great choice.
The more possibilities are, the more attractives are alternatives are there.
And those presents us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This pictured a number of points.
Life in the here and now -- and for example, and you don't have to be considered to be considered to be able to considered in the here, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and you have to be in the close to be in the here and for example, and for example,
And anything is you know, you know, you know, with any choices exclude.
And all of that other has been so been so much as the chose of the co-co-option has become less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this through my searching to a new brow.
I always said always speak to break
Well, it was only one species of speeds, and it bought you know, it was bought to be incredibly unbelievable, it was incredibly unbelievable, but if you were the brow enough and often enough and enough and enough it was enough and enough it was just enough and enough it was a feelingle of the OK.
After years I went to the store for a new --
I said, "Dag, I want to say, I want to say, this is my me."
And the store said, "Wilt you fit easy fit easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relase?
Do you know whether a rita? Will you stone-washed or acid-was?
Do you know a brow with sung-effect?
Will you have something expends up a bit of pipel." And so he went down." And so he was just through it.
I was talking about it. And I was saying a while, I said, "I want to say, I want to say, "I want to be the only brown.
He had no idea which was doing that was and so I got a long all the possible broeks away.
And I mean, I leave the store endlet me endrops the wink of a broek.
I had better mind. I could do it better all these possibilities I could do it better it.
But I don't feeling better.
Why? To do this to me, I wrote a book I wrote a book --
The reason I didn't feeling with all this choice was that I started to expect more of the same brown.
I started without any expectation, because I just know one kind of speeak to the same kind of thing.
And then it turned out there were different and one would be a bit of there, would be perfectly --
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a lot with my brow up with my expectations, and that asked me tell.
The more opportunities people have to have the currents of expectations about the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevilious with results, even if the good results are good results are good results are good results.
Marketings don't know this out.
Because in that case I don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really is going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was
Because when everything was bad -- people could have pretty experiences have been experienced experiences.
In our modern society as we can experience as well-citizens perfection expection, but the best thing we can reach it is so good as we had expected to be as good as we had expected to be so good as well.
Never before we are surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, tors are tors --
The secret of happiness -- this is what you're coming -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness.
I want to imagine -- I want to be a carry biographically elemental -- that I am with a woman who really faile.
I didn't have me with less teappeaced with less teving.
But with less enough his good can't take the good cans.
And finally, when you buy a bad bad of bad speedges as you can buy a bad of being one kind of available before you can ask why you are unteving.
The answer is that simple.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brows available and you buy a bit turns out to fall the time, who is the responsible of different break?
The answer is like simple. That's what you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows you don't have an excuse to fail.
So when people decisions, even as the results of those decisions are good at the decision of those decisions.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western society square clinical depression of the younger generations are high-time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression of depression of depression and suicide is that people have so often television of their high experiences.
And when they are trying to explain the curation for themselves to explained themselves.
So the net toresulate is that we have objective on the benefit of go, but our bad is bad of this.
Something is a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where is taken to be taken to where everybody is taken to be able to be able to where you have been taken to where everybody is taken to be the official dogma, which is the official dogma, which is the official doggma, which is the official dogma, that by everybody is
But that's not.
It doesn't doubt doubt better than can't choose choose -- not automatically automatically that is more choice better is more choice better is more choice better than that.
There's a magical boundability. Well I know that.
But I know that we have been doing for for long the point that choice is freedom that choice is freedom.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can love the best of the best thing that we can love the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best thing that we can love the best thing to be the best of the best thing that we can love the best of the best of the best thing that we can love the best
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material considered countries comes from material confidence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem isn't so much choice is too much choice is too much choice is too much more of choice is to be a lot of choice in the world, where we have heard before, where we have a lot of places on the world, where we have been heard to be much
So the paradox I was true with this closely for the modern of moder, well.
That's frustrated and said to this is frustrating -- Steve Levitt has told that expensive and distated, and installs not help.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help the damage.
They make our lives less perceive.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to be continue to countries where people are very few options that people have very few options of these people are going to be moving on forward the lives of these people go on and forward up to the country to be able to put up in our society
And our lives would go up on the front of this.
That's what economists call a Pareto-in-in-improvement.
