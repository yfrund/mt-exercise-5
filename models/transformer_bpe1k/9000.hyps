The ne@@ x@@ t that I see a lo@@ t of the l@@ ast 2@@ 5 years of the l@@ ast 2@@ 5 years of the b@@ as@@ si@@ on of the de@@ sig@@ n 2@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
The per@@ m@@ is@@ t thing is to be in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed in h@@ ou@@ s in in h@@ om@@ e.

Th@@ at's the l@@ ast year@@ s, and it's very l@@ on@@ e.

The R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ ha@@ d@@ s, a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a t@@ in@@ ha@@ d@@ d@@ s.
And then we sa@@ y to h@@ om@@ e out of th@@ is, and the cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve a gen@@ i@@ den@@ i@@ den@@ i@@ den@@ t a gen@@ i@@ den@@ t of the gen@@ i@@ den@@ t of the sc@@ i@@ ou@@ t.
The gra@@ p@@ p@@ le is that the R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s not a gen@@ i@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't a to be a gen@@ er@@ t@@ ter pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on of pers@@ on@@ on.

And one w@@ is@@ t how that are wor@@ k in how that are wor@@ k in the wor@@ k that are g@@ ood in how to wor@@ k in the wor@@ k
The ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s was so so so so so so in the be@@ t@@ t@@ y and te@@ b@@ le ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
And if you wor@@ k in your b@@ il@@ l@@ y, you know, you know, you know, ther@@ all@@ y, not on@@ ly all the time@@ .
And e@@ very w@@ is@@ t w@@ is@@ t that a w@@ is@@ t of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ ic@@ al h@@ er h@@ er to be a h@@ er of h@@ er h@@ er to be a w@@ is@@ t of h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to be a w@@ is@@ t of h@@ om@@ e.

And e@@ very w@@ is@@ t that you have a w@@ is@@ t that a gen@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ ha@@ p@@ .
L@@ an@@ y thing is that that the time in the W@@ est@@ ing and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was be@@ c@@ ame in the wor@@ ld
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ e, and all chan@@ c@@ e.
Th@@ ere is a new ide@@ a very very new ide@@ e@@ : the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al is the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al is the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge and m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ s.
G@@ ru@@ n a c@@ alle@@ d for ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e, and s@@ ha@@ s@@ s, and from the g@@ ood d@@ el@@ l of the g@@ oo@@ d.
And that was the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ al h@@ om@@ en@@ .
P@@ e@@ op@@ le that cre@@ at@@ ed that cre@@ at@@ ing the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ ies of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ y.
And for the first first of the first first first of the first first of the s@@ on@@ ly was a lo@@ t of the s@@ m@@ is@@ n't a s@@ m@@ is@@ e and sa@@ y that they were a gen@@ er@@ c@@ e.
I have to sa@@ y that I have to sa@@ y that that a gre@@ at b@@ ig@@ g@@ ro@@ d.
O@@ n@@ e one pers@@ on@@ e, one pers@@ on@@ e, one pers@@ on he is a lo@@ t of you and it do@@ ing it or or or or or or or or or or or he sa@@ y it is the s@@ es@@ sen@@ ti@@ fu@@ l or the s@@ m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ s of the e@@ u@@ p@@ , the n@@ ati@@ ve that is a lo@@ t of the cre@@ ati@@ ve -- and cre@@ ati@@ ve that is that is that the cre@@ ati@@ ve -- is that is that is that is a lo@@ t of the f@@ i@@ ou@@ s -- and a lo@@ t of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ l f@@ i@@ on is that that a f@@ ic@@ al f@@ i@@ on to the f@@ i@@ p@@ le of the f@@ ol@@ ic@@ e f@@ ic@@ .

And I think this d@@ ru@@ c@@ k the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , a lo@@ t of the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ .
And if you think that is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on, the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
And we do this chan@@ ge this chan@@ ge is chan@@ ge@@ ?
And we can go bac@@ k to a h@@ om@@ e on a h@@ om@@ e of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ ation of the worl@@ d@@ 's the cre@@ ati@@ ve and the cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and the cre@@ ati@@ ve and the cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve and the cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ en@@ ce of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve and the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the o@@ st@@ er@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ bo@@ dy no@@ t.
And we can be li@@ g@@ h@@ t 5@@ 00 years a@@ at@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ ment to be a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s of min@@ u@@ te@@ s of th@@ r@@ at@@ u@@ te@@ s of c@@ ur@@ sp@@ e@@ ch@@ .

And it loo@@ ks like that@@ , I don't know that you can get it in your me@@ e@@ d.
And then I f@@ ound the s@@ ame time@@ .
Wh@@ y don't no@@ ?
Wh@@ y we di@@ d that we di@@ d@@ n't have to mo@@ ving mo@@ ving to mo@@ der@@ st@@ ?
And it is like th@@ is, it's like th@@ r@@ ough the other things that that you can all all the other other other other other other thing@@ s, the to@@ t@@ al of the to@@ t@@ al c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge@@ s that the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And one that has something like a se@@ con@@ d to cre@@ ati@@ ve something that has something -- so so so so so in the fac@@ t -- so the on@@ ly thing -- and so that it -- it do@@ es@@ n't cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ c@@ ent of the cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ n't have a d@@ on@@ ly d@@ at@@ on@@ e@@ g@@ .
And that s@@ om@@ b@@ er is the par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ s of the b@@ ir@@ on@@ s.
I have l@@ on@@ g the be@@ for@@ e of the di@@ rec@@ t@@ on@@ g R@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ e.
And s@@ he is in the ne@@ x@@ ti@@ r@@ e h@@ ol@@ e f@@ re@@ e f@@ t s@@ he was a f@@ i@@ l of f@@ re@@ .
They stor@@ y about h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er of the U@@ n@@ it@@ e of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a.
S@@ om@@ , if they c@@ ame to the wor@@ k on the f@@ el@@ , the s@@ he was a lo@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to tal@@ k about the l@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ , about the l@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ .
And it wa@@ s, it wa@@ y, so so s@@ al@@ e or a gre@@ at h@@ er or a gre@@ at h@@ t of l@@ on@@ e.
And s@@ ho@@ w@@ s the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and look at the l@@ and to the l@@ and and and h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er of the l@@ and at the l@@ and do@@ .
They f@@ oo@@ t that the gr@@ oun@@ d@@ s, and they star@@ ted to do h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to do one th@@ is, but it do@@ w@@ n@@ .
And they look at h@@ om@@ , and they look at the h@@ om@@ , and they s@@ he was so so so so so so so so so so so it and s@@ he was so so f@@ a@@ il@@ l and s@@ he loo@@ king at the s@@ k@@ e.
Wh@@ en it was the di@@ d of the di@@ d of h@@ er h@@ er to be a h@@ er of h@@ er to be a h@@ er to be a de@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ e to f@@ re@@ .
S@@ om@@ e@@ t@@ y was not not c@@ ou@@ t.
And then the r@@ ight and r@@ ight no@@ t.
O@@ n the s@@ ul@@ t of m@@ om@@ en@@ ts the s@@ k@@ es the di@@ d of h@@ er -- in a lo@@ t of the s@@ our@@ se@@ , on a lo@@ t of other other other other other other other other h@@ er -- in a other other other other other other other other other other other other ch@@ ar@@ n@@ .

And then they was h@@ om@@ e h@@ om@@ e and c@@ our@@ c@@ e, and it was the di@@ d di@@ e.
Y@@ u@@ is@@ t on that s@@ he had a po@@ t@@ l@@ is@@ t to be a po@@ t@@ l@@ is@@ t of a po@@ t@@ t@@ s.
And with other h@@ an@@ d, so they c@@ alle@@ d me to the s@@ he c@@ ou@@ s out of the lu@@ ch@@ .
They p@@ ut it to the di@@ d to be in his h@@ er and it do@@ wn in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ t the re@@ s@@ he w@@ ro@@ .

And then I th@@ ough@@ t that h@@ or@@ , I th@@ ough@@ t that -- what I th@@ ough@@ t my cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ !

I a m@@ us@@ t to a m@@ y@@ sel@@ f th@@ ough@@ t the s@@ ame time@@ , and you know with the s@@ ame time@@ , and you know and you know with it with it and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ y and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s a st@@ at@@ u@@ p@@ .
But s@@ ame in that we had to be a da@@ y of th@@ ough@@ t I have a s@@ m@@ is@@ e of th@@ is.
Y@@ ou@@ 're going to be li@@ k@@ e, that there will be a lo@@ t of cre@@ ati@@ ve that that there is that that that there is that there is that that that that there are cre@@ ati@@ ve in a b@@ ro@@ n of a b@@ ro@@ n of a b@@ ro@@ n of b@@ ro@@ n that you can be a b@@ ro@@ n of b@@ ro@@ n and you can be a b@@ ro@@ p@@ le of the mo@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ le of the en@@ c@@ e.
Wh@@ at is that we do that@@ ?
Ho@@ w can we use it to use it to use it to use it to think we think we think we think we think about th@@ ou@@ ?

J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ : O@@ l@@ ! O@@ l@@ ! O@@ l@@ ! O@@ l@@ ! O@@ l@@ !
And you know, I have a lo@@ t of this pro@@ jec@@ t of these pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about the hu@@ man and it can be the hu@@ man that can do that can do that can do that it and it was the de@@ sig@@ n of se@@ e@@ ts of se@@ e@@ ts of the ne@@ x@@ t of se@@ e@@ ts of the ne@@ x@@ t.
We st@@ ar@@ ound a new p@@ ol@@ og@@ y and we were a new p@@ un@@ t@@ t@@ s, we were the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and no@@ w we no@@ w no@@ w and no@@ w we no@@ w tr@@ ying to a new f@@ as@@ e and the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and the worl@@ d@@ 's re@@ mo@@ ving the worl@@ d.

"@@ Wh@@ at is something that I think about what I think about what is something that I think about what a lo@@ t of what is a lo@@ t of what we tr@@ y to un@@ der@@ st@@ and it to un@@ der@@ st@@ and it on differ@@ ent in@@ v@@ ie@@ s.
We have differ@@ ent b@@ ig@@ a@@ der@@ s are pro@@ duc@@ ed to the en@@ ti@@ v@@ e, it to le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing to le@@ c@@ t@@ s.
We no@@ w are the b@@ in@@ ce 2@@ 0 years of the g@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ al@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ er@@ s.
And then we have the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e to the hu@@ man ne@@ ed to the worl@@ d, the an@@ al@@ o@@ ther@@ , the wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d, to the worl@@ d, to the worl@@ d, to the worl@@ d@@ it@@ al worl@@ d@@ 's s@@ m@@ it@@ al comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .

G@@ oo@@ m is a g@@ oo@@ m, this is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ e.
But when we look at all the gen@@ er@@ s that we can look at the gen@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , it's very very p@@ ie@@ c@@ e, it's a le@@ a@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ re@@ .
We be@@ c@@ ame to the on@@ ly that the on@@ ly that the on@@ ly that was to be a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m to sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c and that we do that the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts and the p@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ ting to the p@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ ting the most of the most of the p@@ at@@ ur@@ e of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e of the en@@ c@@ ide@@ d to the on@@ ly of the on@@ ly to the on@@ ly of the on@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the en@@ c@@ is@@ e of the en@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ e of the en@@ c@

S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y that we see the ma@@ de of these ch@@ em@@ y to be a bi@@ g to do that we have to look at the way that we have to see that that we have to see the en@@ g@@ ro@@ ss the be@@ for@@ ?
And if we can do that a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m to mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m "@@ b@@ ra@@ in@@ ?
A ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m is a p@@ ie@@ ce of a stu@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ or@@ .
So, our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ al@@ i@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al ex@@ p@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al en@@ ti@@ al en@@ ti@@ al en@@ ti@@ al
O@@ u@@ r to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ p the c@@ our@@ se of the c@@ it@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ l@@ on@@ om@@ e.
And us l@@ ast p@@ un@@ t the m@@ om@@ ent of the m@@ om@@ ent to a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ l c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
We are more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ , we star@@ ted 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a c@@ ou@@ t@@ ly for di@@ a c@@ alle@@ d a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic@@ al m@@ is@@ si@@ m@@ ic c@@ ou@@ s of ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ er@@ o N@@ A mo@@ ther@@ .
Th@@ ere are in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed in the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld in the worl@@ d@@ 's D@@ A and 3@@ 0 to le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to le@@ t@@ ter@@ s in the worl@@ d@@ 's a gen@@ er@@ at@@ e, and so the ne@@ x@@ t of the wor@@ k of the stu@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , so you are more and how to be the f@@ ol@@ d and how to be the wor@@ ld and how you know how to be the f@@ ol@@ lo@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ly the wor@@ ld and how you know how to be the wor@@ ld and the worl@@ d@@ d@@ s.
So we had to st@@ o@@ p a new new new new new ch@@ ar@@ ing for the ma@@ king of these s@@ m@@ all the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ ur@@ r@@ ig@@ r@@ ig@@ r@@ ig@@ r@@ ig@@ ur@@ r@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of all the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ h of all the f@@ oo@@ t of these f@@ oo@@ t of these s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ in@@ , to the first in@@ form@@ ation with the en@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ c@@ is@@ t of the gen@@ om@@ , 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little b@@ it in a vi@@ ru@@ b@@ le of the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ s the p@@ ie@@ c@@ es the p@@ ie@@ c@@ or@@ re@@ c@@ tion@@ .
and s@@ ho@@ w@@ s a D@@ N@@ A mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of c@@ u@@ l of c@@ ou@@ s about 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s.
And the sp@@ an@@ n@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing a s@@ our@@ c@@ es or in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an in@@ st@@ op@@ s or the gen@@ e@@ t@@ s, the gen@@ e@@ t@@ s, the gen@@ e@@ t@@ s, and the gen@@ e@@ t@@ s, and the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and s@@ l@@ and@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s, they c@@ ell@@ s, and they c@@ ell@@ s, and they c@@ ell@@ s, and then they were do@@ wn the E@@ c@@ li@@ .
I was on@@ ly l@@ on@@ g with the ol@@ d of the ol@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ ie@@ , and I sa@@ id, that they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they sa@@ id that they had to be a g@@ ood g@@ ood do@@ wn to be a g@@ ood of c@@ ap@@ e.
They lo@@ ve more than you@@ .
And then we think this sit@@ u@@ ation that this sit@@ u@@ ation is that a sit@@ u@@ ation and his o@@ wn ar@@ w@@ er and his o@@ wn and a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to do something like a lo@@ t of the gre@@ at b@@ ig@@ g@@ er b@@ ig@@ g@@ er of the gre@@ at@@ e.
We wan@@ ted to le@@ ar@@ d the ne@@ x@@ t of the mo@@ sp@@ on@@ es and mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s and c@@ o@@ de@@ .
And then we c@@ lo@@ ts of c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter of c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ter of f@@ ir@@ us@@ s@@ s, so we c@@ as@@ se@@ s that we c@@ as@@ se@@ s the c@@ as@@ se@@ s of the c@@ as@@ se@@ s of the c@@ as@@ se@@ s of c@@ as@@ se@@ s --
And to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s that is the d@@ oe@@ s of a li@@ v@@ es of a li@@ ve lif@@ e
And the de@@ sig@@ n is c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ ted with in@@ cre@@ di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation that has to be a comp@@ u@@ ter than the comp@@ u@@ ter that is to be ac@@ u@@ ra@@ l in@@ form@@ ation and ac@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ in@@ form@@ ation and ac@@ u@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And then we can make it for the first gen@@ om@@ e of the gen@@ oo@@ m of the gen@@ oo@@ m was in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ , one of a f@@ ol@@ d f@@ ol@@ d 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ , 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ ,
And then we were f@@ ound the in@@ di@@ c@@ tion of the re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion 3@@ 0 f@@ ol@@ d the sp@@ on@@ e.
And our de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n of the wor@@ ld that are l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g that are l@@ on@@ g and all the other stu@@ p@@ p@@ ie@@ t@@ ter@@ s with all the other peop@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ s and we ne@@ ed to do to de@@ sig@@ n that we ne@@ ed to de@@ sig@@ n to de@@ sig@@ n that we ne@@ ed to wor@@ ld that they have to wor@@ k and we can be a s@@ he had to the s@@ he di@@ sc@@ over@@ over@@ over@@ ed to wor@@ th and we can be a s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ie@@ c@@ e.
We de@@ sig@@ n here here is un@@ der@@ st@@ and in@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have that that there are lo@@ t of you and we see that wat@@ er@@ n in the wat@@ er@@ n and we p@@ ut
B@@ e@@ k you a vi@@ ou@@ : we have a vi@@ ou@@ t@@ ter@@ n@@ s a vi@@ de@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ C@@ , and it's a s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
And then the r@@ ight of those li@@ k@@ es that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e -- and a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for the on@@ ly in@@ o@@ z@@ u@@ .
So we can use the ne@@ e@@ t@@ ic@@ al c@@ alle@@ d to use the ne@@ w@@ s to do the ne@@ c@@ e@@ t@@ s,
And then we can s@@ how to ta@@ ke a s@@ ing@@ le of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we can do a m@@ ight a m@@ i@@ ou@@ s a m@@ ight of th@@ is.
S@@ om@@ m@@ ig@@ g@@ er were c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a di@@ d@@ n't have a di@@ st@@ er@@ .
We have this stu@@ c@@ k and so we can do that we can do that we can do that can be so we can do with the@@ m.
Th@@ ere are are f@@ ound the re@@ par@@ ts that they are re@@ par@@ t@@ s.
And we star@@ ted to make a s@@ our@@ c@@ es with the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ s that are f@@ i@@ ve to 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ v@@ es to be a h@@ al@@ f of th@@ re@@ e and you have a p@@ ie@@ c@@ es of 2@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ v@@ ed to get the 2@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ v@@ ed to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 or to star@@ ts to star@@ ted to be a h@@ ol@@ d to be a h@@ ol@@ d to make a s@@ our@@ c@@ es and
In fac@@ t, we see a c@@ it@@ e of this di@@ d c@@ lo@@ c@@ es of these stu@@ c@@ k of these stu@@ c@@ k and we see that we se@@ con@@ d@@ ri@@ bu@@ t@@ y and a pro@@ c@@ c@@ ent of cre@@ ate and that we will see a lo@@ t of cre@@ at@@ u@@ p@@ .
We tr@@ y to the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ at@@ ic@@ al of the c@@ at@@ is@@ i@@ an@@ s and
And so this is a b@@ as@@ c@@ e.
And we really p@@ ut them to the bi@@ g and we really really really really really really f@@ ound the gr@@ ou@@ s -- 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ , and they don't have more more -- and they di@@ d and they don't have more more and they ma@@ k@@ in@@ .
And that is the ex@@ c@@ it@@ s of all the mo@@ der@@ n of all the mo@@ der@@ n of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
And then we do the other thing we g@@ ood to the other other other other other other other other other other ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We can use a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m that I h@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ation that is that f@@ re@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ " that is that it is that the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to D@@ N@@ A to do D@@ N@@ A r@@ ight D@@ N@@ A c@@ am@@ p@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ y and you can ta@@ k@@ in@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of it.
Th@@ er@@ e's a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ d@@ re@@ s that that th@@ re@@ e mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on the th@@ re@@ e of the th@@ re@@ e of the fu@@ l of the di@@ o@@ d@@ n't have a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation to be a or@@ g@@ an@@ s of the en@@ c@@ e.
And that you can see in the bo@@ th p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ n@@ al@@ , "@@ n@@ al@@ , and it al@@ so b@@ it do@@ w@@ n@@ al@@ .
1@@ 2 2@@ 2 2@@ 4 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ , he sa@@ id it was in the first time as he was in the time as it was a wa@@ y.
Th@@ er@@ e's a th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ s that can do this mat@@ ter that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ s that this ar@@ ound this ar@@ ound this ar@@ ti@@ r@@ e ar@@ ound this ar@@ ound an@@ c@@ e.
This or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ s can be be able to be a li@@ v@@ e.
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m lif@@ e.
I know you know that there is ab@@ sol@@ u@@ t that there is that there was a lo@@ t that there are in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e that can be a new a@@ qu@@ i@@ ou@@ s a new a@@ qu@@ al@@ i@@ ou@@ s a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ u@@ at@@ ic@@ al mil@@ li@@ on to be a new b@@ il@@ y.
N@@ A@@ S@@ tr@@ y has been been l@@ at@@ es that there is a lo@@ t of h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er of the d@@ on@@ e.
H@@ er@@ e's a d@@ oe@@ s a d@@ oe@@ s of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y -- but with a g@@ ood with a g@@ ir@@ m@@ s of the worl@@ d.
G@@ is@@ t is g@@ or@@ g@@ t for that they are f@@ oo@@ .
This is no ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ op@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ p a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ oo@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ .
It's like th@@ is, it's like th@@ is, we can be mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l that we can see a li@@ g@@ h@@ t with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of c@@ ou@@ t.
This is a f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of the s@@ se@@ s of the se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ u@@ di@@ en@@ c@@ tion@@ , and this is the on@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ .
This is more than 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ v@@ ed to the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the gr@@ oo@@ t@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ d by hu@@ man ma@@ de with a di@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ re@@ s with a di@@ st@@ ri@@ b@@ al st@@ ri@@ b@@ al c@@ ur@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ u@@ ul@@ at@@ ed is 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ re@@ d to 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on
And if we could p@@ ut the c@@ ou@@ s with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ol@@ d p@@ un@@ t@@ ter@@ , there is 1@@ 0@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ d 1@@ 2 p@@ at@@ ed h@@ ol@@ d a c@@ o@@ p of the gen@@ e@@ t@@ y c@@ o@@ p the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ p of a c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ o@@ t of the c@@ o@@ p of the c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
No@@ w, how we st@@ ar@@ , we st@@ ar@@ ound a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ oo@@ m to be a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ on@@ ?
And it has a vi@@ ru@@ s is the c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And it is a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y is a lo@@ t of the in@@ cre@@ at@@ e@@ d.
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ p@@ le if you can get your o@@ t@@ s, as you can get a c@@ el@@ y and you get it out of the c@@ el@@ l and you just just just just a differ@@ ent of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke and a differ@@ ent and a other and you a differ@@ ent of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , and you like the l@@ on@@ e.
And the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an spec@@ ies of the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ s@@ oo@@ m in the c@@ el@@ y, but we have a c@@ el@@ y, but we have a l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ y, but we see a le@@ t@@ 's le@@ t@@ 's a le@@ t@@ 's le@@ ar@@ d to a le@@ t@@ t@@ y of a mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e, and a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ent to the c@@ ame of the c@@ el@@ y of the ac@@ ti@@ c c@@ le of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ e@@ d.

We have to f@@ oo@@ t with f@@ oo@@ d@@ s, with the stor@@ y of wat@@ er@@ , or of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ s, or the s@@ es@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ -@@ b@@ il@@ li@@ on of the s@@ es@@ -@@ b@@ il@@ li@@ on h@@ t b@@ il@@ li@@ on h@@ t of h@@ al@@ .
Th@@ at is be@@ come to do@@ .
We use a mil@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ re@@ d 3@@ 0 b@@ il@@ li@@ on on the f@@ ol@@ .
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 b@@ il@@ o@@ v@@ e.
Wh@@ en we bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or to de@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ n't have a en@@ or@@ m@@ s to be a or@@ der@@ fu@@ l of the en@@ or@@ d@@ s.
Th@@ en n@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ , there is c@@ oo@@ l@@ y, or that you can really really really really really really really really f@@ ar@@ ound the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ on@@ e.
And then our wor@@ th of our wor@@ ld is the worl@@ d@@ 's the de@@ sig@@ n with a d@@ at@@ a a with 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on to the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e fu@@ tur@@ e fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the worl@@ d@@ d.
The ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ a@@ in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ on a differ@@ ent differ@@ ent comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ i@@ on that is the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ i@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the d@@ at@@ e.
We are n@@ am@@ ple@@ , and we are ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ it@@ y.
We no@@ w have no@@ w te@@ ch@@ , we don't know that that that they c@@ are no@@ w sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ " to be so to be so so so so so so the c@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ation in@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ ."
We no@@ w have the mo@@ d@@ el@@ y to be a lo@@ t of a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and mo@@ sp@@ on@@ es a mil@@ li@@ on and f@@ i@@ p@@ er da@@ y and a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ it@@ y.
And if you are the stor@@ y of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on differ@@ ent pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ our@@ s or pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s to make a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ and@@ s or con@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s, we can do with a new de@@ duc@@ ed to do a little b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and we can do a c@@ ul@@ ar 2@@ 0 years to the U@@ .@@ .@@ .
And it's a st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of the st@@ and@@ s of the ec@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
We can be f@@ ound for lif@@ e for lif@@ e and f@@ at@@ b@@ it@@ y, or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , or pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ tion pro@@ duc@@ tion@@ , so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so we can be so so so so so so so so so we can f@@ at@@ or@@ .
This is a sc@@ ri@@ p@@ le of what we can do is a new de@@ sig@@ n that we can do that we de@@ sig@@ n that we can do that can do that we do that can really wor@@ k to the chan@@ ge and a new new kind of the chan@@ g@@ ge@@ s and a new new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and the comp@@ u@@ ter and the comp@@ u@@ ter and the comp@@ u@@ ter and the new new new new new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and a new new new new kind of what we can do it is the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
We don't know how the pers@@ on@@ e.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ s, how their gen@@ e@@ t@@ s.
We no@@ w us on our vi@@ ou@@ s no@@ w f@@ our ne@@ x@@ er@@ ation and st@@ o@@ ff@@ .
O@@ u@@ r l@@ on@@ g@@ s have to you to you@@ 're going to be a s@@ on@@ e, a s@@ on@@ e, a s@@ on@@ e, a s@@ on@@ e.
We have the ne@@ ed the ne@@ x@@ t of the gen@@ er@@ ation that are the gen@@ er@@ ation that are st@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ er to su@@ c@@ es and su@@ p@@ p@@ s and su@@ c@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ es like th@@ r@@ ough the gen@@ er@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ es like differ@@ ent spec@@ ies of differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ c@@ es like th@@ r@@ .
But the on@@ ly way we think that we think that we think that bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y is that we can in@@ v@@ lo@@ c@@ ed the f@@ oo@@ d@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ og@@ y and the be@@ g@@ an and the be@@ g@@ an in@@ n@@ ing and the be@@ g@@ an in@@ n@@ ing and we are f@@ oo@@ t with C@@ O@@ 2 and wh@@ y we are the first f@@ i@@ p@@ ec@@ t and the first way that we are the first to the first of the first and we are the first f@@ our de@@ sig@@ n and the first f@@ our first to the first of the first and the first of the first be@@ st way that we are the first f@@ our be@@ st and the first of the first and the first and the first of the first pro@@ f@@ ul@@ ation and we can make the ne@@ c@@ at@@ or@@ n and we have the first de@@ st 1@@ th and we have the ne@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the ne@@ x@@ t of the on@@ t of the en@@ c@@ er@@ at@@ ed the on@@ e.
And then then C@@ O@@ 2 and C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ o@@ , but by the worl@@ d@@ 's the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n the worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed de@@ sig@@ n and we have all other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other th@@ o@@ ther@@ .
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m that we have that be@@ t@@ ter in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
And the di@@ d in the di@@ vi@@ du@@ al in the di@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of 2@@ 5 e@@ t@@ ter di@@ ep@@ , with h@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ , with h@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ n@@ s of c@@ our@@ s.
It ma@@ k@@ es it do@@ ing to C@@ O@@ 2 c@@ ul@@ ar with h@@ ul@@ ar or of the en@@ er@@ g@@ y wat@@ er@@ g@@ y or if if if if if if if if if if if if it do@@ wn as a h@@ ul@@ t or or h@@ ul@@ .
We are on the c@@ alle@@ d or or we are f@@ as@@ t or C@@ O@@ 2 ne@@ m@@ s, what can be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le of p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ le to be a f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ s, which is the f@@ ab@@ r@@ y to the f@@ ab@@ r@@ or@@ m@@ s to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ p@@ le to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ s to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
So in a c@@ or@@ t of c@@ or@@ t we think we think we think we think we think we think that in the b@@ as@@ s@@ ?
We have a kind of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you know, the be@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ s and the p@@ ur@@ e and the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ro@@ ss the p@@ ol@@ d and the p@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ .
Y@@ ou@@ 't you do this T@@ E@@ D can do this do@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n be@@ for@@ e
But we think about the wor@@ k of these wor@@ king about this wor@@ k@@ es that wor@@ k@@ es to use the wor@@ k@@ in@@ s and to be in@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ce and in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing the be@@ d@@ ing.
This was a ye@@ ar and we c@@ alle@@ d the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ , and we al@@ wa@@ ys al@@ wa@@ ys to the fu@@ tur@@ n on the r@@ ight ight ight ight f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that can think that can chan@@ ge that can chan@@ ge the f@@ i@@ b@@ in@@ d the f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ .
And here is the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e that the fu@@ tur@@ e is the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e is no@@ w the chan@@ ge@@ s of the fu@@ tur@@ e sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c and the sy@@ n@@ the@@ t@@ ic@@ al and in@@ di@@ c@@ tion@@ , and in@@ a, and in@@ du@@ al@@ s and in@@ cre@@ at@@ at@@ e@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ ta@@ .
We are f@@ er of the stor@@ y of the stor@@ ies of the stor@@ ies of hu@@ man peop@@ le@@ .
O@@ u@@ r d@@ oe@@ s is that we can do that a chan@@ ce that we can do a chan@@ c@@ es to make a ma@@ y to do that it to do that it to do that it to do that it to do that@@ . D@@ an@@ k you an@@ k you@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to see if you see if I want to see is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's a new technolog@@ y of a new technolog@@ y that we w@@ he@@ d a new technolog@@ y to M@@ am@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t to M@@ a@@ i@@ re@@ g@@ ar@@ n@@ ing a ye@@ ar year@@ .
And it's a om@@ ent of that in your h@@ om@@ en@@ g@@ ing or or or or with h@@ an@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ ds of h@@ om@@ en@@ .
We are going to go to to here here here here are f@@ ol@@ d to be a lo@@ g@@ it@@ al and then can here here and then here and then then then then here and then then then then then then then then it do@@ wn on the be@@ t@@ t@@ or@@ s and the w@@ on@@ es and the w@@ on@@ es and the w@@ on@@ es and the w@@ on@@ es and the w@@ en@@ c@@ or@@ s and the w@@ en@@ .
And it do@@ es@@ n't look at h@@ igh@@ t, how mu@@ ch in@@ form@@ ation how this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or the b@@ oo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation@@ s.
The most of his n@@ or@@ m@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ er@@ a a c@@ am@@ er@@ g@@ ro@@ s@@ s, or a c@@ am@@ er@@ n or of the 3@@ 0@@ 00 p@@ ap@@ er or C@@ on@@ g@@ ap@@ er or of his 3@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 m@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and s@@ our@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ .
It ma@@ k@@ es it all of the on@@ ly that would not because the on@@ ly would be the pre@@ st@@ at@@ ing that would be a sy@@ st@@ em@@ s on a sy@@ ste@@ m on a sy@@ st@@ em@@ , the f@@ oo@@ t sy@@ ste@@ m on the s@@ m@@ al@@ .
It's al@@ so a f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ on is a f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ on th@@ is.
This is a ne@@ x@@ t of a pro@@ c@@ es@@ n't a p@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ , a no@@ bo@@ t@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a.
This is gra@@ p@@ p@@ le of h@@ om@@ en@@ . Th@@ er@@ . Th@@ er@@ e's a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of h@@ op@@ .
And in fac@@ t, and that it was a be@@ c@@ ame to wor@@ th and not a be@@ t@@ ter and so that we can do something that do@@ , and so we can do something that this do@@ , this is something that this me@@ an@@ , this is not a be@@ t@@ ab@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ing.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be this is a p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s what is a se@@ m@@ -@@ b@@ oo@@ k to le@@ .
I would not like to be a lo@@ t of th@@ is.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic@@ al ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of T@@ h@@ t T@@ o G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very g@@ ro@@ p@@ t of the be@@ d@@ in@@ n@@ ing is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ .
This is you really p@@ ut it to see the po@@ in@@ t of a ch@@ ar@@ y of a ch@@ e@@ ch@@ , or a ch@@ ap@@ e or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or a f@@ i@@ ou@@ s or a s@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ u@@ m is a b@@ al@@ it@@ y.
We al@@ so have something with the h@@ ig@@ h of these o@@ ff@@ ic@@ al G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed a ne@@ ar ne@@ ed a ne@@ ar re@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion -- a lo@@ t of h@@ o@@ g@@ er -- a n@@ or@@ m@@ b@@ er than a n@@ or@@ m@@ b@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation --
And if you can see the mo@@ d@@ el@@ y of these p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s to see the c@@ alle@@ d you see the c@@ alle@@ d you see the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to see the c@@ it@@ y.
O@@ r other mo@@ d@@ el@@ s, or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And these ide@@ as @@ as that we can really can really really the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es that the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es of the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es the sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ ons and the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
We h@@ op@@ e that this p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s and other other te@@ c@@ ent and other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other be@@ t@@ t@@ y -- not ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se are l@@ and@@ s for the li@@ g@@ h@@ and a li@@ g@@ h@@ and a technolog@@ y and a technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y to sp@@ e@@ a@@ d, I don't have a technolog@@ y to sp@@ en@@ 't sp@@ e@@ d, so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ .
This is all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And a@@ ga@@ in a bo@@ th of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A of the N@@ A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something something something differ@@ ent chan@@ ge@@ .
This is going to be li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ ge@@ s it do@@ .
This pro@@ jec@@ t of the pro@@ jec@@ t of the in@@ cre@@ at@@ , who are not a h@@ om@@ ch@@ , who are with e@@ ac@@ h o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ .
A er@@ n@@ at@@ ed S@@ e@@ a@@ g@@ on the wa@@ ys is a lo@@ t of S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ g comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on of N@@ a@@ y@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ e S@@ t@@ on@@ d S@@ t@@ at@@ ed S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ e, by S@@ t@@ on@@ d S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ at@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ e, by N@@ a@@ x@@ t@@ on@@ ly f@@ is@@ i@@ on of S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ t@@ on@@ ly f@@ is@@ i@@ on of S@@ t@@ on@@ ly f@@ is@@ i@@ on of S@@ p@@ ic@@ e f@@ is@@ i@@ i@@ e S@@ e@@ e S@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ on@@ t@@ un@@ k@@ k@@ k@@ un@@ at@@ y S@@ t@@ y@@ t@@ y S@@ y S@@ t

So this is li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's the s@@ si@@ b@@ le of S@@ e@@ a@@ g@@ on@@ e.
Wh@@ en we do@@ , this is we do@@ , that the be@@ , that we can see the be@@ for@@ e the c@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
The sp@@ ac@@ h of the c@@ it@@ al pro@@ b@@ le has been here to the be@@ t@@ in@@ ds of the be@@ t@@ in@@ .
The comp@@ u@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on that are all these c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and so that they are all the en@@ ti@@ m@@ s with the e@@ ac@@ t of the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ our@@ s -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ oc@@ k@@ k@@ es that they are the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d R@@ oc@@ k@@ om@@ en@@ s -- and the G@@ ra@@ s@@ ing the c@@ our@@ se@@ s -- and the c@@ e@@ t@@ y of the c@@ our@@ se of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s of the c@@ at@@ u@@ p@@ le of the c@@ at@@ ur@@ e and the p@@ ec@@ t of the o@@ ther@@ s --
I don't know if you don't know if you look at the other other other other time@@ , or an@@ y@@ thing about other time@@ .
Th@@ ere are lo@@ t of that there are lo@@ t of that there are a lo@@ t of that there are lo@@ t of that there are lo@@ t of that there are lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of that there are lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of that there are lo@@ t of the n@@ at@@ .
I want to do a N@@ a@@ h@@ t N@@ a@@ h@@ t N@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ con@@ d se@@ t@@ on@@ es and a f@@ ro@@ ss the f@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ n@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ n@@ at@@ er -- and what I was a lo@@ t of the wor@@ th -- which is what I was a c@@ alle@@ d the wor@@ k of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ it@@ e of the c@@ ra@@ in@@ d of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ n't f@@ ic@@ e of the worl@@ d@@ 's the wor@@ k of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ one of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ 's a c@@ our@@ c@@ es of the wor@@ k of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ ing@@ le of the c@@ ame of the c@@ ou@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the wor@@ k of the c@@ oun@@ t of the o@@ t of the o@@ d@@ d of the o@@ d
We had to st@@ re@@ d the a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and we c@@ all the d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ c@@ e.
This is a con@@ st@@ ri@@ b@@ le of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y to the N@@ e@@ tr@@ y to the N@@ o@@ t@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ . Y@@ ou@@ 're just a con@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ le of D@@ am@@ p@@ le D@@ am@@ in@@ , and the c@@ am@@ p@@ le of people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es the c@@ am@@ p@@ s, and the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ le of people in the c@@ am@@ p@@ le of the c@@ am@@ p@@ le of the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ le of the c@@ am@@ p@@ s and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the n@@ at@@ or@@ .
And you know, of these or@@ an@@ c@@ es of this or@@ an@@ c@@ es a de@@ sig@@ n that has a de@@ mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this or@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And so these are all of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es that F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ in@@ s, which is on this way that that in this way to be able to be on this way to be on this way to be on this way of this m@@ us@@ .
And we can be on the f@@ ol@@ d s@@ he can be f@@ ig@@ er@@ .
And you know, I ne@@ ver ne@@ ver ne@@ ver got to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t that would be be a M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ of@@ t to wor@@ k.
It's c@@ alle@@ d that is so so so so so so so that that is so so so so so so it to be so so so so so so so so no@@ w to be so so so so so f@@ ul@@ t her@@ e.
I think this is that this you can see that this is that this man@@ y that this is that this man@@ y c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's s@@ m@@ is@@ : all the s@@ m@@ is@@ t of the sp@@ a@@ ir@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a b@@ ig@@ g@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g of th@@ r@@ ough of these hu@@ man@@ .
I will tr@@ y to tr@@ y to fin@@ d what I tr@@ y to fin@@ d the be@@ t@@ t@@ y to fin@@ d the be@@ t@@ ing.
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch more be@@ com@@ ing out of th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
E@@ r@@ y@@ 's s@@ ame up to be a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ s a s@@ m@@ s -- his f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ s --
This is s@@ ame of the N@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ ter D@@ am@@ e that g@@ ood th@@ is, is al@@ so g@@ ood by the pro@@ gra@@ m.
And if we have the f@@ our po@@ st@@ er po@@ st@@ er in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ k of this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of these v@@ ir@@ c@@ tion@@ .
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y to sa@@ y that we can do the things that we do to do the things that that are the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al c@@ oun@@ d@@ at@@ a a a -- the d@@ at@@ a -- it -- it -- it is a lo@@ c@@ tion@@ , on the c@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ ch@@ , and the A@@ ar@@ ch@@ , and the A@@ ar@@ t of the c@@ op@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ op@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ op@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ op@@ ul@@ at@@ ing of the c@@ op@@ e.
And then these f@@ o@@ to@@ s are with these f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ s and f@@ ol@@ d a very very very g@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ s and a very g@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ s and a lo@@ t of the s@@ k@@ in@@ .
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that from the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e of the A@@ ar@@ t of the A@@ ar@@ t of the en@@ ti@@ st@@ .
And if this is a stor@@ y of the stor@@ y and L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ et L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ s A@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And this is something that g@@ ro@@ w@@ s something that is that the bi@@ g of the en@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ s and the c@@ ou@@ s of the people who us@@ t for the people who us@@ .
H@@ u@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ s are f@@ o@@ wn of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a that are differ@@ ent chan@@ ge@@ .

It's not a mo@@ b@@ ly to c@@ op@@ en to do that it do@@ es@@ n't have to do a lo@@ t of th@@ is.

This is all of these are f@@ ra@@ in@@ ing f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And they go by a c@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ de to a an@@ s@@ w@@ er to be their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have to get their h@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't get a g@@ ood f@@ ul@@ t f@@ er h@@ al@@ f by c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a h@@ al@@ f f@@ er@@ .
And they are very im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant to le@@ .
And then we w@@ ent to wor@@ k. C@@ ar@@ ound the technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y to the technolog@@ y of the technolog@@ y to be in our min@@ u@@ te@@ s of min@@ u@@ te@@ s of the wor@@ ld -- where the wor@@ ld -- where the wor@@ ld -- where the wor@@ ld -- where the worl@@ d.
Th@@ er@@ e's one of one of one that I have one of a pl@@ ac@@ e, where I lo@@ ve the W@@ i@@ F@@ i@@ F@@ i F@@ i@@ F@@ i F@@ d@@ oo@@ d.
I don't just want to be because I want to be because I want to be because I want to do to be a m@@ i@@ ve for the@@ m@@ sel@@ f to m@@ sel@@ f to be a m@@ y@@ sel@@ f for it.
But g@@ ood e@@ d, that we can see that that we see that we see that in our o@@ b@@ er of the wor@@ k of us that we can see that we st@@ o@@ ther@@ , on our o@@ ff@@ , or no@@ w on the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y or no@@ w or no@@ w no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w@@ .
We can look at a f@@ oo@@ t of our s@@ m@@ ight and the s@@ k@@ s, with our s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ le of our mo@@ b@@ el@@ l and our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ac@@ k@@ es and our other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other and our and the other other other other other other other other other other li@@ g@@ h@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
And s@@ he all of all of them all of the st@@ an@@ s@@ s@@ ?
And I w@@ ent this on this e@@ -@@ ma@@ il@@ t@@ ? Wh@@ at I tal@@ k this r@@ it@@ ? Wh@@ at are the r@@ it@@ ?
And if it tur@@ n as the an@@ s@@ w@@ er "@@ N@@ e@@ ,@@ " and the f@@ oo@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ , and the f@@ oo@@ t of our si@@ m@@ b@@ al@@ .
And we look at the gre@@ at the gre@@ at b@@ ig@@ g@@ ro@@ , the little b@@ ig@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing is a c@@ le@@ , it's a c@@ le@@ , it's a c@@ l@@ as@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld ld the wor@@ ld ld is the wor@@ ld the worl@@ d.
Th@@ er@@ e's a s@@ es@@ s@@ es@@ s@@ es@@ s, but not a c@@ oo@@ l@@ d@@ n't know of c@@ oo@@ m.
And so you see the wor@@ ld no@@ w is the wor@@ ld no@@ w that it no@@ w is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w of the wor@@ ld no@@ w of the wor@@ ld no@@ w is no@@ w the worl@@ d.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is w@@ he@@ ther this is or w@@ he@@ ther it do@@ ?
And the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is@@ : "@@ Y@@ a@@ e@@ ."
We all know what we all know what we all the g@@ ood is a g@@ ood about what I do is a g@@ ood about what they are do@@ .
And that are en@@ or@@ m@@ s of two two two two two two two two two f@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two two two two two f@@ ec@@ ts are f@@ ec@@ ts on the hu@@ man on the hu@@ man on the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man on the hu@@ man
A very ex@@ per@@ st@@ ri@@ p@@ le of f@@ ec@@ t is that the first wor@@ ks wor@@ ks wor@@ ks be@@ c@@ ame than the be@@ c@@ ame wor@@ ks and wor@@ ks be@@ c@@ ame more than the be@@ c@@ ame the be@@ for@@ e.
And you know, you know, they sa@@ y mu@@ ch as a lo@@ t of people sa@@ y to make a c@@ u@@ p@@ .
I just just like a very very th@@ re@@ s@@ ing her@@ e, a very ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of a d@@ ri@@ p@@ le of a de@@ sig@@ n in f@@ r@@ it@@ e and li@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ ons of li@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ on.

And so it to the f@@ i@@ f@@ t that it was so so so so so so so so so so so so they are do@@ wn to the people to the s@@ ame people and the s@@ he c@@ ame people who are going to the ne@@ x@@ t and look at the ne@@ x@@ t and the ne@@ x@@ t and the ne@@ x@@ t and the ne@@ x@@ t and that they c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and so that they c@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ , and so f@@ a@@ st@@ .
And of c@@ our@@ se of the in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing the st@@ at@@ e.
And that me@@ an@@ s not on@@ ly people who had to be a people who had to be a p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ er@@ g@@ h@@ t because they don't ne@@ ed to have to be a lo@@ t because they sa@@ y that they sa@@ y that they sa@@ y that the c@@ u@@ p@@ , but they sa@@ y that they sa@@ y that they sa@@ id that they di@@ vi@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't the wor@@ ld that they di@@ sc@@ re@@ en@@ c@@ e.
And then they are f@@ l@@ ying to 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to 5@@ 0@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ .
The wor@@ k@@ y was a n@@ am@@ el@@ y to be able to be their o@@ wn to be their o@@ wn to be their o@@ wn to be able to be a b@@ ig@@ n@@ or@@ .

And if you can go to the e@@ u@@ p@@ , you want to the e@@ u@@ p@@ , you want to the r@@ ight s@@ he sa@@ y@@ ?
You don't want to be the c@@ our@@ c@@ is@@ t with the f@@ on@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame d@@ s, or the s@@ ame d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ es.
And that's the first in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing f@@ ec@@ t the f@@ ec@@ t of us is that we know that is that we know that is that we know that the l@@ am@@ m@@ is@@ e of our o@@ b@@ vi@@ du@@ al@@ s and c@@ ou@@ s and s@@ ul@@ t the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of us with the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of the re@@ s@@ ul@@ l@@ at@@ ed th@@ .

This is a g@@ ro@@ m@@ al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve that you sp@@ i@@ ve for that you sp@@ i@@ e you get to get your h@@ om@@ e.
And you sp@@ e@@ a@@ k to the ne@@ x@@ t of the s@@ he c@@ ou@@ s of the s@@ he c@@ ame time@@ s it do@@ wn to the s@@ ame time@@ s it wa@@ y.
And then more op@@ t@@ y and more and we di@@ d to be a lo@@ t of the c@@ ou@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and we have a c@@ op@@ en of the c@@ op@@ en of the c@@ op@@ e.
