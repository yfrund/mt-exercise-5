And I ly, last year I shows to shows that the police of skap, that the past three million years of years of the United States of the United States of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem because it is the requipic problem because it doesn't the any problem because it did not the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem because it disects.
The ice is the North police is in the certain the clopping heart of our global system.
It looks in the winter and crimmply in the simply in the simply in the somer.
The next dia that I shows is a version of what happened is a depick of what happened in 25 years of what happened.
The permanences is clearned in rood.
As you see it looks at dark it from dark to dark out of dark and the sick of dark and you see it from dark to dark out of dark and you see.
That's the year is the year in the winter.
And it crimp in the simply in the simply in the simply in the simply in the simply in the simply
And the called permanence, or five years or parents, or almost like blood is almost like blood and the body.
In 25 years is the way of this is going to this in this gat.
And that is a problem because the born around the North IJessea born Issea very big high of high other, and there is a very big high of course, when it was designed by microm in metttance.
And the corn, with the total story in the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, that would be high to the entered punt of the atmosphere.

Thank you very much.
And I gave a put a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I really, I remembering back with a hold about how that machines that machine.
So I am here. I didn't have a whole that there is not the LHC is the biggest scientifical experiment in the enometers, 27 miles in the tremenom, 27 miles in the treprenometers,
It has to be the stances that needs of the billions that are less than a billidone billidings the universe universe to 600 million time.
Enorm ambitions, thus!
This is the machine under Geneer fase.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Big Bangs in detectors in detectors of the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATATLATLAStor detector -- 44 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLATLATLAS.
And in 10 september shape for the first one.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That is a fact in the control in the control in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that is all the LHC around the LHC and in the LHC and with a piece of the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, which is in the detector in the detector of the LHC in the detector of the LHC and photograph of the first party of the LHC in the LHC C, and it's a photograph stream of the LHC around the LHC that is a photograph stretor of the LHC in the LHC and base of the LHC --
And other words, when we saw that photograph on 10 September wishing that the machine works, which is a huge depenormous -- which is a huge expension.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest right, or thing, or then, and then somebody to Google and saw that the Internetpage.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact of scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what we had to make these gold before.
And that behaviors 13 thousand amps of the machine on follows on follows on follow.
The engineers under you will say, "No small of your draw."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superperature lawn.
So at myself grads, squantly the gart, between the stars, can between between between between between between the gard.
In a breases of the nects of the nects of the LHC, sat the LHC, sat a constructive.
And then through the before something before was there and it was insides electrical against that 13 thousand ample of thousand ample of them before.
This was the result.
This is another indrugs that that magins that magnets that magnets more than 20 percents before that magnets were about 30 centimeter better better better better better better of the magnets of the magnets before.
We protected about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of half them, what we did do.
We all have a tools all of it.
Now they're back on away.
Eind mimagine will be the LHC weather.
We will be able to be him to expect and we expect measure or you're going to be able to be able to the expect with the inside of the universe of the universes of the universe.
Now, of course, who have increated the debate of scientific operens about the value of scientific research. It's easy to work.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to the fact that we figurther than ever go and the LHC.
I was going to be the last words on the Englist scientists Humphy Davy, did the devices of the value of the value of his learning experiments of his learning Michael Farday, this is so fail, "Nthing to the pristy of human before of the human before in the cority, and then we are not have to be design that in the cordinary of the design, and the nature that we are design, and design that we dicame to be design, and designing our scencature in the design that we dicame out of the lactababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababable, and the lact of the teteted, and dicided to be ded to be able to be
Thank you!
I would start to ask with you to ask to your children to go back to your children and you play with blockids,
And then you discovered how to move to the big, they oppake, they oppast, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and hands by the hands of space and hands of space.
Rutty is started to be able to understand the world to understand the world to understand it.
If a inspired by a inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- sams with my advision and my mediction, and my mediction, I started to ask me -- what if we use a computer -- what if we use -- what if we use a computer -- which is a computer musical fingers that we could use a lot of wonderful ferently ferenty fingers that we can put a figurreautany distical fune in a singingingingings that we can unity, and then we can information with a ferates that can information with a fist of fist of fect of fults, and then fulates that ents, and then fultribuse, and then fingingingingingingingingingingingingingents of phys
And can we orders like we want to be able to be a sing?
This is what we decided to see us so that we decided to see a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort saments is a Sifect of a Interactive computer sive computer side.
They can be able to the hand they can be felectly put them to fell their movement and they fast, and they fast, and then contact.
The churning is the physical handelbarness, like blocks like blocks, like blocks.
Bovens are Siftables a new ecosystem for example of digital information for the ways of digital information.
There's this hold a more physical difference of virons, and early beware of their movement and even of each other, and even of the way we have to refired new and leutter, there are different new and leake a more different new and leak to design a more physical different new new new way.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftis instically instick to set a video to set a fired to change and others and others others and others and others and others and other.
These interactive portraits are interactive portraits of each other.
Indis of the fact each other, they will interesting for each other.
If they become up to become up and can be able to be able to be able to be become up.
And then felt they're movement and hell.
We realized to realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interesting of these interactives of all of these interactives of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a small of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the same of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the inter
In this example of three Siftables of Siftables for and I can use them to go into a leg in a leg ging, where they use them become increated to go into a leg ght good.
If we have governments, we go back.
There are some cappe possibilities for the educations, prepared for the education, mathematics and logics and logics that we want to give people the motivity and the result of the entire things to see the possibility.
Here's the development -- this is the development of a Fibonacci reprogrammmmic.
Here's a spelt that is a spelt between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in any around a wanted to get on every Siftable, and fetable, and fear control controlling in a words.
And after about 30 seconds is about 30 seconds and different ent ent new series of letters and different a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
This is some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am to try and there and a video of it.
They were working on it.
And one of the most interesting things of this passing things of this passion is that people needn't needed instructions to have instructions to have a instructions of the passions.
All you have to say, "Mak word." and they know what they should do it.
Here's some other people on the tests.
That's our jungest batest bated, rights, right.
It looks like it is the Siftables and the Siftables --
For him was just a blocks.
Here's a interactive picture.
We wanted to learn for the teaching of languages.
This is Felix that demonstate.
He can burning new characters in the scene of the Siftty burning the Siftable, and it can be crently the table.
Here's the son he's coming the sun.
Video: The son comes to it.
David Merrill: No he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The oranjust.
God than! Yeah!
And then the sups of Siftables and the name electables and the characters and respond with anothers -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
DM: and so his own story of story tells.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it decision.
Video: The cates flying away again.
DM: The last example I will show today will shows Is a synthesizer and live music strument that we have developed to developed a sound, where every Siftables and drum.
One has four different variations of variations that you can use it.
These happiness, in leave Siftables are injected in the pattern of pattern themselves.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leg Sift-controlle-effects of a learning effects like reversal effects like reverss.
They are to be a sound and put up to can't so.
And the frether the algemental effects like tempo and folum that become pattern on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: There's starting with a leave in two Siftables, to a first patropattern, to a extra patross pattern, by a extra lead.
Now I place the basses of the bass.
Video: There's foot I feel what I was slagwork.
Video: There's the filter I was the filter on the filter of the drums, so I can invent the effect of live on the effect of live on the flet of the flet of the filter of the filter of the filter, I copened the five business.
Video: I can get it very explains by the opportunits of the tempo blocks.
Video: There's the filter I was the filter on the baas for what more expression.
Video: There's the pattern to patterer the playes.
So I don't have anything to planning, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, and heard it like I want.
And the end of the enginded the following of the volum Siftors to shows to the left links to show to do left the following to the left of the folum Siftly by the fold of the volum Siftors to can.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, and it's going to be a new people, and then the way that are better interfaces that are better in the brains and bodies our brains and working and working on the brains and working on the brains of new people.
And today I had the time to set you a new element in this design pictures with some of single possibilities that we developing to single in the labory of the labory of the labor.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is that this bad to a very new generation to a very new generation to the Inters to the Interact with digital media, which is the information to our world like to our breath.
Thank you very much.
I look at you look at all of you all to talk to you all all and talk to you all to get to you all to get to you all with you all to get to you with you all to talk to you all with you all and I look at all and you to talk to you all and I look at all and you get to talk to you all and you all to talk to you all and you get all to you all and you and you to get all of you all to you to get all and I
I'm writing it.
Books is my work, but also much more than that.
My life live long for a long of script and I don't think that ever change that will change it.
And yet there is a unlight of a bit of life and career and career and career to my relationship with my work with my work with my work to my relationships.
And it started a book that I did understand that have been a memoired member, "Ets, Bidds, Bidds, Biddle, in the first of the world to my first through the world and international passeller world and international state.
The soppently is that people are always to be able to be dam.
Worory -- you know, does that --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you don't bang this succcess?
And you don't have your life is that you live your life being and fails before but never a book sult publist where people will leave to be able to be able to be a whole of warm that people will leave before you?
And you don't have to be a bang pres?"
Any gamse, you know, you're going to be you.
Of course, that would be very before I remember to be 20 years ago, I was a tienerous -- I was told to be a tienery -- I was told that I wanted to be a tience.
People said, "Ben you don't have to be never success?
You don't you get to resource, that you don't have to researching through the sing?
And you don't have your life to be able to work on this work in the work without that there is something from the public and that you are going to be able to the public dreaming with your broken and you put your broken bitter?"
Is in that stream in that stread.
In the corts comes my answered on that questions, "Yah.
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that enough.
Always always all it.
But I also much other things that bangly, you don't know for all of it.
For seearly for example, and other engineers.
But what is being is writing to write myself to be fail, where that anglast from.
Is it rational rational rational rational rational ?
Is it logically before somebody is being to the work for the work for the work for their people?
What is that what is that we are creative processs, that we make us to creative us to make the effects of the mindity, something that is something like that, something that is not happening.
Now, it was my father. He was society engineering engineering that there was in the 40 years who was working in the 40 years who was working for it has been working for it.
And so it says, "Yohn, how is the chemist?"
Now, so it didn't talk about it.
And to be able to be a fairly engineers have been by the century of the century of the century of piece for piece for piece of piece of them are piece for piece of them.
Schrice wonderful that have reputation.
Not only a scribes, also other creative people have been reputation to have been instability to be instability.
Look at the grimble doing the most magnifically creative before magnifical creative e-century creative euw.
And many still young, fail, fails by own does.
And even then, they didn't even become not fail, and under their gave gave before.
In the last interview for his dream said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailers."
That's what to say what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of expensive looking at it.
We all have the first time and we have heard and have the same time.
The brained is that creativity is that creativity involvity, and that is indecided and that a poorest and that a artistently existing to existence.
And that's why I want to ask today here today, you can you with that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that idea of life that is a lives to anybody here today to you with that idea to ask today and somebody today to you today today.
Do you know, OK?
Because I think about it is a good I think about it all of the whole I thought it is not a prettty prettty though.
I think it know.
And also even another dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century this century.
We can creative a lot of better better to life.
I know that it would be a miled for me, in my situation, in my situation, and base, to live to this dark to that dark to those dark to those dark in my situation.
Some the fase where my career in my career in my career now.
And then you know, I'm going to young, am young, right.
I can maybe I can maybe four decades doing through decade.
Home probably will be anything I'll be now another published the outside of the outside on that extraordinary successful book.
We are here with friends, so I can see it with friends, so I can go to your friends, and I can probably light my grander successary of behind me.
Jese, what a idea!
If you think if you think about the chair of your ochtends to the drive in the drive of the drive in the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love me with the work that I love with the work where I love to ched.
The question is: "Hoo?"
Now, I'm going to think I'm going to the conclusion to the conclusion when I can only be a psychological scribed in the process.
I have to create a safe a safe in the shows between myself and my government and my government to the reactions for the response to my future for the future of the future of the future of the futures.
I have the last year for ways to ways to do that.
I'm in the history in history and have shistory in other societies to see or another thing to see or others maybe a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help creative perprocess.
My search has been braw to the old Grooks and Romeins.
Let it is a long and increated a long story.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romins and Romins were not creativity of people didn't have a henefits of hendly before did.
And Men that creativity that creativity was a good partly reverss, which was a good place to human came to human and unknowledge and unknow.
The Gries, the Gries, "creativity of creativity "creativity of creativity "demonen."
And the Socrates believed that he was a demp that he had a demusced that went to the way.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they have a called a little bit of creative creative creative before a genious creative a genious creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative fortor.
The grapy is that the Romeins with a genion without a genion of pience pended pended pended in a genion of characters that the funder pended pended with a genion is not a genion of pended penters a genious pended pended pences a genious pended pended a genic beneineering fun.
In their police was a genic good entitudes that was a genic entitudes in the ateless of the ateless of the ateless of the ateless of the ateless of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists of the work of the partistence.
And it was the work.
Brilliant! That's precise the shaps that I had the first first about had, the psychological screen of your work.
Everybody who is how that in his work in his work.
The artists was so in the purpossible of example, to example.
If you work a little bit of work you don't have all the early ever ear.
Everybody knew a major that you had a unvisible genible of course.
You know, you know, you know, it work to you, then not only to you.
Everybody makes you have a lot of unhandied gence.
Lange time is that the Westen creativity was the Wests creativity was became the Wests creativity was the Westen creativity was the Westen creativity was the Wests creativity was the Wests creativity was the Wests creativity was protected to protected the Wests is that became to protected the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything came change.
There is a very new ideas, the individual people's individual humans is the middle point of the universe and mysterious and mysteries.
And Go space for mystical resources from the godal world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People that creativity creativity was following out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual.
And for the first thing in the history was became a genic passed became a genic and not that she had a genic warwarward genic and not that they had a genile.
I have to say that I have to find a big fail.
One one person is one person individual individual individual is the fast, the bron of the eught eughtly mystery, of all the euwonder, creative and creative the family of a frather for a fraishing for a fral human psyches.
If you get somebody question in son in slike.
Egos are being to go up to gigantic proporties and there are incredible increating expectly expensions.
And I think this druck the last 500 years of artists capot has made a lot of artists has made it.
If that is, and I think that is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship between the relationship between the human beysterion?
Maybe not not it.
Wellight 500 years rational humanism not small humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the course.
And probably shows in the audience of people who dicated scientific developed scientifics of the idea that early foot of the work of the work of artists of the work of artists of the work of the work of the work of the purpossible per of courses of the purpossible of the purners that people who have
It doesn't seems that I don't get you to get that.
And I asked me to ask me it.
Why don't why not?
Why would we didn't we have thought that every day not most?
It's just like a lot of hold as a lot of the bigners of the total concerned to the totally makes in the creative process.
Everybody who has something something has to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, and so in fact, and all the creative process -- not always that creative process -- not always that creative process --
And that sometimes the banormally put it.
I have the great American discovered American discovered Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone of the great American discover.
And she is a dicined. Her life all life all of all life all of all the close.
She told me about her you're told on the platattold of Virginia.
Soms, if they were the work on the work of the work she was a closing she was a close of country.
It was, so said it -- it was like a big golf high---a-a-air.
And it was closed golfd than about the country.
And she feeling the ground understand that he started to ship and wished that her on that her on that her on that her life for her life.
They right to home, they had to set up and they had to see it and then they had to see and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and packing.
When it was closing her her her her was her only her enonly to script the same thing to script.
Sometimes it wasn't set enough.
Then rating and rate right not.
And in the moments of schools before the closs, and fast, in her closs, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another dich.
And then there were just to be a moment, I find the beautifully part of the story -- that they almost beautiful.
And then it was in human in search in shows and paper the closing of her head.
Juist on that moment had she had a potter than a potter
And with her other hand, she told me she was the closing she closing the slows of the air.
They picked it to be disly in his start, and then it back in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body in her body.
In that cases came the close of close that was very came in pyer, but then in the clownered follower in the follower in the follower in the cords.
When I heard that hold I thought -- what I thought my creative processs:
And that's what my creative process is not a medium! I'm not medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a music, which every day on the same time, and the same time, and sweating with blood and trans and trans down, and trans down.
But even in that day that day I have been in that day I had been before.
You know, you will also know the myself that is a creative that there are creative ideas in your operators in your operate from a bron that you can be increative to be increative that you can can be increative in.
What is that then for bron?
How can we use it to be using without that we have become to be?
And in a way that is a good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think that I can think is musics in musics and musics.
A few years ago, I read it for a time, I was a while.
We had the him of it.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life life the toonce of his life is the currency artists that from all the major to get all the major to get all the major creative impact in him in him in him in him in him in him in him of the currences that in him in the unexpensive in the unbefore of his life in fact,
And the year was the year was Tom what was down to the yet.
And in a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the snell and changed the process and changed the process of radical radical reass.
And he was there there there there was so reason, he heard a fragmental odid.
The decided him, like inspiration that wear, as inspiration, undergriculture, course.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to the fasthing.
But it didn't it.
He had no paper too, not a piece.
The great spited spantly after the melowning of hims, "I wells the melowho ckes me the equales me and then it equals.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it do."
He didn't get in panic, but he stop that whole human-talal process and did something new ws.
He looked at the air, and said, "Sorry hold and said, "Sorry hind the stuff that I was doing the piece of showing the same down?"
"You know, you can really a lot of that I can you have a lot of small of s?
If you really want to be a lot of you have to be later, you have to have to be away for you.
And that's not going to be somebody else -- it's a lot of fall.
Gohents at Leonard Cohen." And from from that she locked the process of the process of the process of lowing in lowing very different.
The work is still the same dark of the dark of dark untive.
But the sware spiting that creative process in him in him oproom in him opriciance of the genies.
It was to the gene of course, and the skin and levernment and levernment and levernment and leverse.
And in realized that there was no reason to go to extraordinary to go through to go and reason it.
It also could be a wonderful busine, bizarre conversation between Tom and the own and the own and the own and own the own of Tom and the own and the own of Tom myself to be a wonderful of Tom and own way.
That story has my way of working changed.
I have all all of a head.
I was in the screen in the scrips of Ets, Biddles.
And I give me a given moment in when I hope.
You know, you don't know that that you don't want to be a good and you think it is a differences and you think it's a difference. It's bad book.
Not simply bad of bad is really different.
I wanted to do it all the project of the project of the project every project all the project of the project early in the project of the project of the project of the project of all the project of the project project.
When I remember to me Tom that are genic who was going to be a point to way.
I wish to me from my manuscript and ridge me to a leg high of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we thing, we know everything that if this book, we don't come to book, it's not only by me.
You can see everything I have in the stop I have in the stop me.
More I can't give it.
If you're going to be better you've got to do your mind.
Snap you don't you know that? Thank you, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not going to be through.
I just write do, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are being that being is a lot of opportunity, but being today."
Tja--- Unity, it's coming here, it comes on the now.
Euws ago, in the North African wish in the North African wood-basically people to dance in the North African music.
And then then to the chtend and hind the chtends.
And that was always that was always because the dances were folerd professionals.
But sometime, sometime, there is a brease.
And one of that dancestorning thanks before.
You know, you know, what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a performer.
It was like the time the stile stile and the dance of the poor.
He didn't did the thousands of night, but now failed now but now all shows of the thousands of thousands of thousands of the thousands of it.
And he didn't leave longer only not a humans.
In him, under him, bove him, bove him, bove him,
A good fired to him him.
If so it happened to happened, people who was what it was Dan they started to clapping and in clore and in the core and in Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was the for them.

The challenge is real real real real changed of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, old one of "Ol, Ol, oon."
And that you have to still the day in still of chages and flamengods.
If a artists in Spance or magically dous, or magically dous, "Allah, one, One air, other, and eyellow."
One avail, sic: a glimp of God.
Prirecognize what we needed to it.
Lastiled is the dance that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next 11 hours of chtends not a good ladge lawing more doesn't reason more it.
And in that moment is he went to a little bit of parenty with read man before that makes never before will come more to be high off.
Maybe there will never be more somebody in the body of God attentions.
What does it now to the rest of his lif?
That's hard to it.
That's really really hard to be a creative mind for a creative mind.
But so pinsides it doesn't be it.
Imagine you don't get to extraordinary aspects of your person complicating from your person complicate.
Imagine you believes you have a time, you have a time, and a whiled of a father specificate burning a time.
When you get there to any member them, they are give somebody else.
That's how to protect, can't anything.
I hold ind that thought to be done that though.
The last months I have a book that a book that is going to be different. It's going to be different. It's going to be a lot of reason is invented to reason is expensive to be expensive to a book a lot of course.
The operens of that illuster progress.
If my mind with me to the hall, I love me to the same priath of the same picture. Seoutsidn't have ence.
That just you just just just your work.
And you just just just your this, what it is.
If it is to dance you, and thank you very much.
If the government is that you're decision to decision to enious of the wonderful bron of the wonderful bron by the wonderful bron by the long."
Thank you not, thane it doesn't do that.
And also then, "Ol!
I believe that hear.
"Ollish, how than ever we pure out of pure human love and own wn own and own wn own foots.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have the once of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can means, and what it means of new sets of new sets of new sets of new sets of new sets of genomes.
We started a new point of a new point of punt: we were the digitalizing and now we try to the digital code of that digital code to a new fase in the biology in the biology of life.
So we tried to ask the big questions.
"What is a living a lot of biologists have tried to understand understand understand understand understand understand understand what is a lot of biologists have to understand what is a lot of biologists have to understand what is live.
We have different benaders to leaders, the back to minimal components.
We are almost 20 years on the digitalizing for the digitalization.
When we have the human genome of the biology, she was the from the biology, the basically world, to the digital world, to the digital world.
Now, we try to ask to questions, or we can regenerate, or we can create new life and creating this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organisms, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smaller genome for a kind of that can be able to a kind of that can be in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a named or we can come to a names.
We can in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that we are in the 500 or so that we are there.
But if we look at the metabolical coolical coal, which is relative simple simple with the insimple affect with the insimple of the insimple of the insimple of the insimple of the metabolical coal.
Now, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all of all genes that we can look at all of the genes that we can expectly invalue that would be a live, it's very invent cells.
We decided to be why the only route pretty that was to expensive this chromospited to synthetives to the componenty of the most fundamental questions to ask this chromospity.
And so we started to questions, "Can we started a chromos?"
Stake the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never seen before.
And, if we can do a chromospite a chromospe?
A chromosly is a chemical inert material inert material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is life is exponential eating on exponential eating.
Our modern to scripe the genetical code of lows lower lower to slowing the genomes.
And our last point would be the last point on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, for now, with a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethic experiments.
But it turns out that the synthiss of DNA very hard.
There are tiends of machines in the world, that small pieces in the world, 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 letters in lengineers, and it's a generation, and how longer of course, how more following to the more follows in the world in the world in the lengines in the world in the world in the pieces in the l
So we had to make a new method to the society of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigators of all folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi and the genome Phi 174.
That's a little virus of virus that bacteria death.
We developed the pieces the foltcorrection.
and they had a DNA-moleculecul of about 5,000 letters.
The spiting part of the piece we started a chemical stributting in the bacteria piece in the bacteria of the bacteria of courts, and fires fires and fires fires in the bacteria.
The viral particles were cells, they were called cells, they came back and done back and done back and done the E. coli. coli.
I was unclear in speak with the oil, and I said that they said that they have to be fast.
They laughts more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation in which is that that is actually building a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much larger a lot of larger betters.
We wanted to be full bacterial chromosly building to build the full chromoss.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetical code.
And why we decided to build them in cassetttinators of viruss, so that we could figure the cassetttes, so that we could cassettts.
And to understand what the does of a living components of a living cell cell cell cell of a living cells.
The design is crucial information in the computer information in the computer in the computer that digital information in the computer information in the computer than that.
When we first first of the first time this genome called the standard in 1995 was the standard-precision of 10,000 basepares.
And then we found after we found after 30 folts. If we had the original sequence had used to use the wasn't used in stead.
One part of the design is designing that 50 letters that have to designs that have to designs with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we need to build so that we need to design that they can design to design that they can design to build the 50 and design that we can design that we have to design that we have to design the design
We designing here, we designed here.
Maybe you have the water right?
Beause this: we have a four letterly genetical code: A, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for ruwweigh--aminozeros -- that there is a sible of clearning for each ozure.
So we can use the genetical code to scrips, small of the genetics, thought.
And then we all "The equired we all "Well, we all the mile.
Some were told closed that there were no global wards
We have this pieces that we can design them to enzymes.
There are enzyms that they reparts and in any sets.
And we started to make them stuff, and started with stuck with stucks, and starting to 7,000 letters and put it to 7,000 letters and you've got to small of 24,000 letter, to 724,000 letter, to 72.000.
In every citum cross we have a sure of these pieces so that we could sequences so that we could create a process because we could create a process that is going to create a process -- that will will be a process.
We try to reach the point of automaticians to reach the point of automatics.
So this is a basketbakebal.
And once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow easy in E.
And that expensive all the modern of all modern tools of molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolog recombination is used by the biology to recombination to reparticular DNA bak to the biology to reparticles to repart of DNA to reparticular and called a mechanism that is using a mechanism that is used a mechanism to recombination to recombination to recombination to re
Here's a picture example of it.
There's a organism gently Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiod-million radiation to can.
And that you see in the bottop panel, shows in the bottop of the room cordinary of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he was the weather in each obviously as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are thousands of organisms that are organisms that are thousands of organisms that this art.
These organisms can following up in the way.
They can life in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in space, that can existing in space, a new aquaticians, a new aquatishing environment.
NASA has tricrens that there is a lot of is, there's a lot of of it, there.
Here's a thisming micropphotograph of the moleculecul that we made with this processes, with this processes, with this processing with the right mechanisms that we did in the right designing in the piecup.
It's a little bit of them being that they automatically society.
This is not a electron-microscope photograph; this is a little bit microscope.
It's like a big moleculecule that we can see with a light microscope that we can see with a light of moleculeculeculeculecule of moleculeculeculeculeculeculecule.
This is photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we expensive in.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetical code.
It's made the biggest moleculecule of people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecuulators is more than 300 million
If we would be the same through with a 10-points letter, without of the pieces of the genetics need-basically code ade away to drucks.
Good, how do we started a chromospe? How do we activers we activers?
And with a virus is the clearly easy.
And a bacteria lot of increated.
It's also simple if you put it in the eukaryots, like wish and then you know, the celerators and doing a other in, and that's what you know is like that, and that's what you knows like the clones.
And in the bacteria is the chromospling in the cell integrated in the cell transplences that we have a full transplentation of a chromossive transplently to a other, and can active.
We have a chromospent of a micromospent of a microbs.
These are about about that far as far as a people and mouths and mously mouthing.
We foot what extra genes and so that we could have to be able to be foot to this chromoss.
We have the represented with enzyms to make all the ears to make all every eating all the ears.
It was free brains we are in the cell of cell -- and you will go up in the cell of the cellited graphic imagined graphic fairly in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cel.
We thought he was just to developing it would be tried to developing the process of developing developing what would be developing in the process of developing that it would be before that he would be able to developing it to developing the process of developing that it would be before to developing out of it.
This is a essential evolutimate mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of that that have a second chromospits have been opgenomes or a third thousands of them in one thousands of the kind of own in one of the species.
People that evolution evolution evolution or anything that have change change in the changes of biology measure.
There are enzyms that restricti-enzyms are gentle, which is a real DNA very.
The chromospent that in the cell has not eating it.
The cell -- the chromospited that we stop in -- well.
It was expensive, and the reference, and the other chromospeain the other chromospital, and why we had a whole with the new chromossive with the new chromossive with the new chromossion.
He was blue the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the cost all the cost of the soff of the engineering of one of the engineering of the new kind of based in the new kind of based in the cordinary that we had been in the called in the cords.
All of changes, changed the member changed -- when we changed the genetical code was precty in which was changed.
This is a may be cleft as genomic, but we are in the basically change in the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things
And I have all the before that this is not a squep of the Cample -- this is pretty on 3.5 billion years ago, and I have a new new picture, and I have a new version of the Camburble explosion of the Camburning that there are based to scale, based on this entered on this dignital explosion this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's free is the free is clearly if you look at what it is needed to what it is.
We go and we go into the side of six-half to go to 99--half billion people, heard the next 40 years old.
And to place in my context place, I am in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
And for each of us that in 194, in 1940 years will be there are four in 1940 years will be there.
We have to be food, with food, with the single water, medicins, medicine, medicins, burning the six-half billion billion of billion its of billion of water, and we've got to the sessars.
And that is set that it's going to do that.
We use five billion ton cols, more than 30 billion oil of oil oil of oil polic.
That's 100 milos fast.
When we have biological processs, in ogenty process or whether to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge.
And then of course, all that coal, all that coal, in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really coming.
And all our worldwist designed to descenes that we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design of the future for the future.
The electronics had been a doing of them had a doing components, and look at the diversity that is coming from there's there.
We are pretty experience by a biological reality and our picture.
We have techniques are techniques are fasting synthesemethods to called combination of combination genomics."
We have the possibility to build a million chrobot that a million chromosomes a million chrobot to make a million chrobot to build a million chrobot to build a million chrobot to build a million chrobot to build a million chrobot to build a million chrobot of chromotive.
If you think about 20 million different genes of different genes or protect processing to optimalizing or medicine or medicine or medicins, new vaccins, we can make a little bit of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the scientists of the scientist.
And it's only a standard selectially selectially selectially being selectially being the standard of the other.
We can select selecters for life fatbarness, chemical productive, faccinproductive, and so on.
This is a screen of what real designing designing designing where we work to work on the gart and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design designs.
We don't know how it will see how it will see how it will see it.
We know how their genetical code out how their genetic.
We are now our fourth now in fourth generation stoff.
One you have seen your ground to ethanol face experiment.
We have two-burning generation and third generation that are going to be coming from coming out of the community, and more high burner of burning or different kind of buttanol.
But the only way that we think that biology that biology in food prister food-food-higher prister and the scribed and the scribed with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his foods, and we are design the way that we are the way that the first way we are the first four first generation and we four first generation in the first of the first making basically made the before making basically have to have been to have the foodgest of the first time,
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwist design, we have all learning other method of other method of other method -- but by our world.
This is a organism that we have scribed in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 p, squired to temperature cool dissects.
It makes methans of CO2 with being molecular water stint water striple water as energy sources like energy sources.
We are to look at the ice of the CO2 we can needs to fired four to fabry fabried to fabried to fabrite back to brands back to branding this process.
So in a cortinutions of the basically thinking about basically asked on the basal questional questions?"
We have a real industry -- you have the skilled the petrol industry industry industry to replace.
Yes. If you don't do this, where you don't know about TED, where it down.
A important energy bron be.
But we also use to the way to use these works, to think of these works, to think of these works.
This year was the gry, we always just a bit of the fact on the fact on the right of the right vaccin.
I think that can change that change by tefortunited vaccinated vaccinating vaccines of shapes.
Here's how the future of the future of the futures are going to see the evolutionarches of evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolution breathrough the future.
We are better of humans better of people.
Our goal is very quickly to explains that we make a chance to explains to do that great leave that great leave you to do that.
What I want to show you is like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have a new technology that we have a year ago. This is about a year ago. This is Seedraging. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you have a local high or in the cordinary data can work data
We look at many here many gigabytes of digital imagine and can be able to fired in and expensive insists, navigerate and the sort of terms and the sort of of of of of the wishing and the sort of engineering in the way to our wishing and in the way to our wishing in the way to our wissues.
And it doesn't make it from how much information we look at these collectors or picture.
Most of his normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a smell of the Library or Congress, and then in the 300 megapxixal camera of camera ps.
It makes all the prestates of the prestates would be move to influences in a third system, the high system, the high of pixels at the screen system,
It's also a very flexious architecture.
This is a fully book, a pretty example of nothing that is that.
This is a graums by Dicks. Every cole is a heading piece.
And to evidence that it's actually actually actually to be a picture, and not picture, to show that this is really text to show this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a book way to read a e-book,
I wouldn't example.
This is a realisticer example. This is a challenge. This is a challenge of the Guardian.
Every big pictures is the beginning of a particle.
This is a real purpossible and the experience of a real paper or crent, or making a scaling or crence, or making medium medium is a scale.
We also have something about the core of the Guardian.
We have a next advertist of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra normal adverty information --
If you want the possibilities of this autom, you see it.
Or other models, or even technological specifications.
And this ideas can really be really for sides that we can actually do the percent of handels of handeling the screen of them can do.
We hope that this is not pop-hyps more means and other third flaured -- not needs more need.
Of course, curally are called a hand put for a technology like this, I will be here to a whole time like this, I will be spending to this field, and expensive that we can also field.
This is all the weeks in the U.S.
ASA pick on a pick of the NASA .
Let's look at something else.
This is a building on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
A thing is Seadragon and it's a very beautifics and the other piece of fissue fished by Nah Snahington, so on the University of Washington, and Statz University of Washington,
And Rick Smomic called Research, Research. A beautiful.
So this is a live on the Web. It's made by Seadraging.
When we do this is doing this, that we can see through the pictures and the multi-resolution experience.
The spaceage of the picture.
The computer-vision goritmes these imagoritmes these imaginations, so that they are coming with the real space -- the Grassists in the Canades -- where they are genomes in the Canades of stabilized diassionates of stabilized diassions, and all these things are space.
I don't know surrence, other environments to show to show to show to show you or another environs.
There are a lot of space.
I want to like a Noah's heard of a Noah, set -- and this is of a fred prototype of Photosynth synth synth synthese -- to the communicate that we worked in my head of the envire of the environments on our website, at our website.
We had to be real characters of advocates so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dairts, and then you see the Flickr. You know, just just just show in Flickr, and you get pick in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the cample of the New Dame in Flickr.
And every of these orance being chairly a pictures that is a picture of this model of this model being model of this model of model of this model of model of this orany of model of this orany every of corance that are depence in the orance of this orany orany of this orange of orany orange that orany of this orange of this orance of this orange of origination that orance before.
And so these are all Flickr pickr picks, which is that in this way that are room copped in this way of space.
And we can use on simple on simple well.
You know, I had never thought that I had ever thought that I ever thought would work.
It's about the whole here, it's going to be here.
I believe you can see that this many types camera's camera's camera's cameras, a big number of garia of course, and a big number of course.
I will try what I will find the images.
There are so much more descened, and throughout and through.
Eryning here, even even though a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daigh is also good chaster is by the program.
If we four via pick in a pick of these environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This is now the data -- of the whole collective heavire of home collective of hold -- and cotttts.
And all these picture, with each other, and shaps together than the same thing is the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Aard the Aard of the whole Aard state.
And that this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that big in complexity when it used to use the probably devices in the parts of people who are using the people who using using the people who us.
Their own photographs are before that? I have anyone else else.
If somebody would like to pick any and their nams and their nams and infers, and then my photograph of the Notre Dairly with all that data, and then I can use that that you could use that metaphold to that metaphor, that metaphor, used to every simply of the photographs of the kind of moditoral before calready social social experience.
And of course, it's the bice product here, is a imments of a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from the airplants, satelepts, and other photos, and other passions, but also of the collective members of the collective means of the collective memberty of course, but it's the collector, it's not only interesting of the collectance, but it's not only interesting of the collector.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to start that what is to software possible in the next years, in the born, in the basically in the world, by anyone of the world?
BAA: Yes. What this is really discover.
The creates are creating your wishs, hyperlinks between pictures.
And it doing on the basis of the data in the pictures.
And that is designing the right ight now when you think about the right dom of semantic information in semantic information who's discovered to expensive a lot of these picture.
When you look at the web search in the web search of the picture, and the text of the webpage, and the text page, and the text of what the imagination about what the picture.
What if now that that is a little bit of your picture?
Then the number of subjects, semantic biness and the higance of the same thing that is going to be gigantic network-fect. It's a classical networkeffect.

And then we come to work. Carl gave to work us to that technology in that technology to work every minute every day of every day -- where in the world -- -- -- -- and then in the Randolph How tell punning how to worworld -- in the world in the world -- and then then then then then we have to work.
There's a following place, which I love it down.
I don't reason that because I want to well. And I don't like to hold myself.
But good that is enormous secttility of work is that we are in that we put us in that we were going to work on the time, or now or now.
We can look at a footbalaxy of our sions, with our mobility, with our mobile of the opportunity, and our Blackberry on schools on schools on schools on school.
And even if they all expensive every minute of that wedstick of that wedstributty minutes with all of that wedn't have this phone of court?
And all I ream on this emailtine? Salreager?
And even if it answered "Ne" is, experience we experience, and we footbalwish on our son a very other way.
Where we look at the big of that, the big smally, materialistic saves -- life is a croastile, it's a croastile.
And so the world is asking the world ouout.
There were what choices, but not all choices, but not everything was a cost.
And so the world is now.
The question is nowing this, Is this good or bad of bad this?
The answer, "Yes."
We all know what we are good to is, so I go to about what is going to be bad about what is going to be bad about what is going to be bad to it.
That is ormous sector, two effects, two effects effects on the mens.
A very extinup, is that the first away that it was before the first away before.
And so much choices like this, people in the lasting people to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of example example in front freedoms in freedoms.
A collegs of me crown, to investment in front of Vanguard, a big policd, a big policy society with about 2,000 of courses working about 2,000 few fastigure on 2,000 few cors.
They discovered that for every single polics that was the working fundred that the works, the particular percent of the works,
Whyeleless fififify fundress work less works, and then five five five five five five fundres?
Because it in fifify is so lastify to choose that people just choice to the next day, and that people are just expensive to the next day, and that they were down and that throp, and so on.
And of expensive comes from it.
That means not only that people after their pensionate sionate and not enough to eath because they have see, because they have see, but also the choice that they have see, but that the choice was that they work that they work to she was the working for the works.
That lots of songs per years to 5,000 dollars per year to their now for now to their now fairly away to their now fairly per years of the nor purpossible of the nor per years of their nor purpose.
The worked about the works, and the works, to be fail, to depent.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice.
And I think that the world is so going to be there.
If it to go to the eeught the recentury to the right choice choices, right?
You don't want to be operated to the fast, or even the wrong fundred driving the wrong dom.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the labor, and the labor, and choose early less to the result less than the result of the result of the sult of less than we had been been bed.
There's measure to fast.
And one of the other, there is a choice, for example, in the same thressings, back-drives that was not the choice was not perfect perfect that was not perfect the choice of the choice of the obviousness.
You still you have in a different choice for that another choice better would be better in a other choice.
This is threat the alternative sick for that you get to get your choice of choice.
And then it downs to the fold of choice that you have made that you have made a good choice choice way.
And the more options of being easy is to easy to have increating from indicating increating the gecozs of the gecozing of the gecozen optitions of the mind.
A second reason has been with substitutic costs.
And then Gilbert called morning to how to depended the values of things we depended them to the things we depensive them to the value of the things we depensive them to the value of the things we depensive to how to the value that we depensive them to how to depensive them to how to the value that we depended the value that we depended of the things we de
If you can have many many alternatives you can already fasting all the alternatives of all the alternatives that you evidence you can either your education.
And that you makes you have less to the alternative that you have cozen your minder before.
A example. For the New Yorkers understand understand understand a lot of you,
This is like a little bit of the example of this example of example.
This is a still of the Hamptons.
They have a dure second woning.
They are sit on a beautiful stream again. Go's in show.
Beter can't be a toos." "Well, it's a little bit of was, "It's august. It's august.
Everybody in my buburning in Manhattan is the city.
I could do my autom, for the deor of the deside for the destret."
And he was there to simmmmmmes, with the idea that he was a great parkly day parking of father.
Substitutic costs are going to be cost of the voldoing of our choice that we have a wonderful choice choice choice makes that we have a wonderful choices that we have makes to make our choice of the fold of our choice that we have to have a great choice of our choice choice choice that we have to have been makes to be maybe that that we have to
And the more possibilities are more possibilities are more result alternatives.
And that presents, and that is going to be substitutic costs.
Now, a picture.
This is a little bit of a number of punts.
Like in the here and now in the way and now you don't have to considered to it.
And a point is that you have a point of choices expension.
And all that other has been so be the number of cances, which is the community, and every single of the community.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came to this is my looking for a new browing to a new brow.
I always always speak to always the brows.
Because was only one kind of sperbrowl, and that cost, and you know, the past totally not sat the same time, and the browlling ong, but if you were incredibly enough and faiftly enough and fast, and the brog the totally cutter, and the brog at the totally and fast, and the brog of the brownd, and you know, and you fairl, and the brow.
And then I went to the wink for a new wee.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a sperbrowll, this is my made my made my made my made my made --
And the wind said, "Wilt you fast, or fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed faxed faxed faxed faxed faxed fax.
While you know or a ritis? Whilt you stone-washed or access?
While you have a broek with sleeping effect?
You know, you can expensive a pips, or flink pips pensive pensi." And he was so fair.
I was going to be a time, I was a while, I want to said, "I want to the only browing that there was asked early early was."
He had no idea of browing that was a hours, and so I've got all the possible brows passes.
And it's the only thing is the wind passed the wind passing passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed passed brown.
I had better thing. That all that possibilities that could be better better better better I could do it better better better better day.
But I don't feel better me.
Why? Om is this to me, this is to me, I've been a book a book book, I have a book book a book called a book of course.
The reason I didn't better better that I was more to expect more of the snice of the snity, I was going to expect a good spited spent of a good spite of the sness of the snicking.
I started to replace, because I was just one kind of speak and one kind of sperbrowners --
And then it was a different of different wars, and one of the perfect of field perfect perfect perfect.
What I was a good, but not perfect.
And so I was my browing with my browing expects, and that steleurning me teleughtly me to expector.
And the more possibilities people have expectations of the same purpossibilities.
And that means people less less to results, even as the good results, even if it good results.
Marketings don't know this it.
Because in that case, you don't have to talk about that.
In the really is about about it.
All was all better better everything was better better way.
Because when everything was bad of people were experienced to experience.
In our modern made society of courses of burgers expection expection expection to expection and that something that we can be reach to expect that is so good as we could expect to the best of the modern of the modern of the modern burgers expection
Now, we are before we expectation, because our expectations, my expectorences are before.
The secrency -- this for benefit of happiness -- the sectors -- the sectors not to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly to expectly
I want to ask here -- I want to be a car biographic elemental elemental elemental elemental fantastic fantastic is fantastic fantastic is fantastic fantastic pically elements.
I don't have to her with her less teated me less the minder of less mean.
But with less enough has been good can.
And then then you know, when you put a bad bad of bad sperbak coops like there's only one kind of privice -- you can fail, you can fail.
The answers is in that case.
The world is responsible of it. You didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of broad, and you know, you know, you can get a lot of different, and you get a that black to fall, who is the despairlinging?
And the answered is like simple is like simple in it. That's like simple you.
You can make a better choice choice.
And with hundreds of different brows have not have excuus to fail.
So if people decisions, even if people decisions, they are decisions, they are cup, they're going to talk about their choice.
And they have themselves themselves.
In the western samenled soundly depression of the junder of the junder generations of the junder generations in the western generations of the junder generations of the junder of the western ships of the western society of the western society of clear ss.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significance, but a significance, but it's so so fast, is that people are so faired and moord, is that people have so failing their high expects.
And if they try to exploration for themselves to try themselves themselves themselves themselves.
So the netors is that we objective before we ever sproperts, but our bad of garbad of it.
Now, a society of that.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to where everyone for where becomes to where becomes to where everyone to where everyone for anyone to where everyone of it.
But that's not not it.
It's not a developing that can be better better than not better than not costs, but not carbon the follows that more choicically that is more choice.
There's a magical grounds. What is possibilities. What I don't know it.
But I know that we have all the point that we are already freedoms are freedom.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost of the best of the best of that we can like to be best to best us to be best to be best to best us to be the best of the best of the best of that we can like to be best to best us to best us to hold the best of the best of the best of the best of it.
The choice in industrialized countries of material countries from material considered flying flow.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about heard the problem where the problem is that there is not a lot of choice choice.
The paradox I speak here with name for the modernect of modernect West.
That's frustrated, and that's frustrated, and that's going to be gisting your gists told that dure and lastil pure and shows not enengineering your children.
I say you know, the same thing about this does choices -- and they don't have to help choices -- they don't low. Ergnow.
They make us live less that life.
If a part of what people in our society in our choices to make all that choices to make the choices where people are live, the life of that people would have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put it in the police.
And our life would be living on it.
That's what economs a Pareto-better better better.
Everybody is better through redepart of greater -- not only just -- not only the last of choice that we are meeting us with us with us of choice that we meet.
And then then it was a little bit of this. If you read this picture, sould, you know, "Ach, what is that fisn't you know what is no?
Nothing is possible in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision.
A writal imagination, a shorty world's world -- that was my first interprettation.
But the longer I was about it. But I did to better that this fissue. I started this fished.
Because in fact, there is this on the fishing brains to create break to create freedom, but least, you don't have a freedom, but legning.
If you get the vision to create the fissues to create less to create less to create less to create less to create less to create less to create the fishing less to create the fishing less to create the vision.
It's leads to more avery, and less teating less teving.
Everybody has a vision to cor.
This is freedoms -- it's a very single separate -- possible for us. but for us.
But the depence of a figures vision is asking fissue to ask is to assingly, understand it.
Thank you for your attention.
