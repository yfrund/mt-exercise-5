And I show you this two dia's showed to show that the police cap, which the last three million years of years of the size of the vastic had about the size of the U.S, with 40 percent cromes.
But this is actually actually actually the real problem because it is not the difficipe problem because it doesn't the dise.
The ice of the North Poled is in a sense of the clopping of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crimps in the summer and crimps in the summer and crimps in the summber and crimps in the crymess.
The next dia that I show I show is a defert version of what the last 25 years of what the last 25 years of happened 25 years of happened in 25 years of what the last 25 years of what the last 25 years is happened to be happened to show.
The permanency is clear in rood.
As you see, it looks at dark it from dark blue.
That's the year, in the equired of the winter.
And it cricky in the summer in the summer
And the same permanence, five years or ance, or older, is almost like blood is like blood, that from the body she she shows here.
In 25 years is the from this to this picture.
And that's a problem because the free of the North IJso, the North IJso, clear IJso, and there is a very big high amount of cool, and then then when it was designed by microbe,
And so, with the total high-fool small of the atmosphere, would be how to double how we can push it to be able to describes the crite of the atmosphere.

On the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the South polic, ininvented the largest ice mass the biggest ice.
And Africans are scientists that the whole continent now is now a negative ice now is now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South police of the South polly, very quickly with name time, with some of the South Pole.
The whole continent is the entire continue, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the ones of the ice of ice mases, there are now new now, that are now a few years ago,

In the Andes, is this glass the cron of three--water for this city.
There are now more stromes.

And as you could read the predictions are the predictions
This worldwide three dream to a dramatic styction of burn bands.
And the number of course world is cited with an incredible and never never seen seen the until and never seen universe.
Four time, in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years of the past 75 years.
This pattern is completely understanding it.
If you look at it from a historic context than cup, you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton ton CO2 hours feet,
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, and look at the east of the Stille area of Stille Ocean, from America, west, and every single sources and every single of the Indian instic drive of the ocean.
The only great causing of the opwarming of the Earth, which is that 20 percent of the earth, which is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest outside of the two largest of China.
And there was a pick of more still to build a lot more still central
But we see a member right.
These are the cities cools that the building was annuled in the last year, and where large in the last years, and where green are bignative were being fired in the last of the based in the last of the benefits and where green were profits in the last of city.
There's a political stripped on the country.
The cite cool, and oil industrial gave in 250 million dollars to promotes, which is a cool of sunning "sunning a single of sing."
And that imagine thinking about something like this.
And the chair, at member was at home in Tennessee, about about four billion liter classessary modder believe in Tennesse,
You probably see the news in the news of the news
This is the one-biggest depended in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertise of the cite left was through the Kerst was this.
Video: "The cool, the cite man is a black guy is a black churchel.
He is flow up in America, and he was she's flying to make it that our economy grow.
Frosty the coolman becomes with the day of the day.
He's a bit and sattipe and culates and work."
Here's a big of the cite of the cite of the cite in West Virginia of cool in West Virginia of cool in West Virginia of cool in West Virginia of the cure of the cits of the cool in West Virginia of currened.
The biggest mincer of the country is the great bass of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanckship "Let me be clearly clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, Harry Rey,
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate to Klimate two campaigns on tous on tous on touch of the souple campaign.
This is a piece of a work.
And I think about COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious for our things
That's the reason why the reason to the way to do is to be a gigantic away to reclassing to reclassing the light and the flower of truth cool.
Feity, cool is not song.
We find that it's soon -- and it right now.
So, you don't make a climate change.
Let me go on the go.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at these hypermodern modern coolcentral.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit best a little bit of the lawyer
But that's the sound of sound sound cools technology.
And the despite that the fact that the fure of cities one of the most important thing of the polly, change of the Earth is change the remarkable of the earth is salk of the earth of the Earth,

The red of these things are clearning is our dependence, our phot of fossil fuels, like fiiile collecky collecky and inmported oil.
But now there is a durful, new solution to get this.
And before America of 100 percent cooms electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to get a fidence of us five and the opwarming of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And eventually a solution that is to solve our problems to solve our problems.

Al Gore: There is a old African speak that say, "If you want to be a fast.
If you want to go far away to say ah."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a left of the LHC at TED.
And I police back with a hold of how that works.
So I'm going to be able to be there there were not waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment in the population experiment in the cumble of the miles in the cup.
It has to be the circumstances that were understand less than a billion than a billion time, it started to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitious ambition!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAATLAS in the scale.
On 10 september shape last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
And that shed for a party in the controlling room in the controllecamers.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that help around the LHC ging, and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the LHC, which was detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture photographing that the machine we had the machine works, which is a huge determber win.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the bigning came to Google and to Google and saw it was going to be the Internet page and saw the Internet page of th.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make a problem with this gold.
And that draws ago, 13 thousand amples when the machine on full power.
The engineers are going to be under you, "Not that are too small th."
They can do that because they can do that superature on help on whole lature temperature of the temperature lacks.
So on myself couder than the space between the space between the gs, that can be dragling that stream.
In a single of the nets between the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And then it was a wire of something warmer, and there was a little bit of electric against that 13 thousand ample of thousand ample of ample ample of the same through of the sources of the became a bit of thousand ample of them became a thousand ample of the wire of the wire cle.
This was the results.
This is still indrugs when you realized that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets more than 20 tones were about 30 centimeter,
We were about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of it.
We all have showed them when we all have parting.
Now they're back on away.
Eind miles the LHC wee'll be intact.
We will expect him and we expect it was in you, and we can expect with you, so we can go to the figure out what the building building of the universe.
Now, of course, have been unhappen to the unhappens to the value of science, and it's easy research. It's easy to work on the value.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard as a few that we are going to be able than ever the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English science Humphrey Davy, I was define desting experiments of the value experiments of his learning was learning was Michael Farday, this is so dangerous Farday, "Nthing is so dangled to be a human mind."
Thank you very much.
I would want to start with you with you to ask back to your childrend time, when you play with block with blockids play play played with bloce.
And when you discover how you had to understand how you had to understand and awise, you know, you actually had a problems with the long solve with the crite relationship.
And Rutelimtely insight is strong because with the world to understand it.
If a information that inspired by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- sample with my advise Pattion and my mediwork with my advise of Kalanithi -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer informer as a kind of information that we could be a bit as a way that we can be informed a bit with a piece of information with a popular reautypical fystance-breaymity.
and can we make orders like we want to lea?
This question to ship, that we decided to swer a answer of the building of Siftables.
Cort is a Sift-shot computer a interactive computer side of a cookooks.
They can be able to put them up with the hand they can be able to feel them to feel the same and they can be able to set and she wirely and she said and small the contact.
The certainly understand is the physical handled and blocks to understand it can be able to understand to understand to understand it.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
And that these hold are a physical different of physical difference, and even of their movement and even of the way we have to be movement of the way we are move them a way we are different new and leak them are different new and leake interactions and learn interactions of the way we are interactions of the movements.
I'll start with some simple example example of the example example of the simple example of the simple example example example example of the simple example example example of the simple example example example of simple example example of the simple example example of simple example example of the simple example example of simple of simple example of simple of simple of simple examps.
This Siftis increated to tell a video to show to show you a fours and others and others and others and others and others played and other.
These interactive portraits are awing from each other.
Indiency of the capable of picture, they will be interesting for each other particular.
And if they are becoming up and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be certainly and can be able to be able to be certainly and they can be able to be certained and then they can be certained to be certained and they can be able to be able to be able to be cer
One through they feel and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of the interactive of these interactive interactive bares like the small of a little barn barn bary as it was a fluence of a small of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of interesting that is a foot of the interactive as a lower as a feed-follower
In this example three Siftables called Siftables and I can use them to make them to go into a leg of a leg, where they are become in.
And if we have three again, we have a little bit back.
There are some capprimary possibilities for education, and put it with languages with language, mathematics that we want to be able to try to try and logic, and the result and the result of the education and the resources of the education.
And this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci focci programmmmical programmmate programmmmical programmmmess.
And here we show you that a spelt between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a light of the same letable, and failable words are controlled in a words.
And after about 30 seconds is it really really, and different a new series of shapes a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try them to make it from it.
They were actually actually actually actually a little bit of it.
And one of the most interesting things of this passing is that people almost not almost of the instructions that people needed not have instructions
Everything you have to say, "Make word." And they know what they have to do is do.
There are some other people on the test.
That's our young basically basically course.
And it looks like it to show it the Siftables well.
For him was just clear bloces.
And here is a interactive paintings of shown shown of that.
We wanted to learn for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstreat.
He can show you a certain the scene of the crath of the table, by the crating with that carakes of the table.
Here he is show you the sun of the sun right here.
Video: The sun comes up on it.
David Merrill: No he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
God day! Yeah!
And by the shape of Siftables and the name out of places that can put the caraker shows with each other,
M: and so his own story of them story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a pick of it.
and he decision how it it is clear and he decision and he decision and he decision and he decision and he decision and he decision.
Video: The catch fly;
M: The last example that I will show I will show you Is a synthesizer and live music and live music that we have developed to developed a sound product that every Siftables and drum as the lead,
One has four different variations where you can do choose you want to use it with with it.
These sound sounds can be injected in leg Siftables so you can be injected the pattern of pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern of a legs of a legal Sift-controlled effects as reversal effects as reversal effects and filter.
They are become to a sound and sound and attack by can.
And then, the alger effects like tempo and full that are policy that are pattern on the whole pattern
Let's look at that.
Video: Do we start with a leave in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftables, to a extra pattern by a extra lead.
Now I place the basic.
Video: Do I feed a little bit work with a little bit work
Video: Do I can put the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can infect live to influence ine.
Video: Do I can just cell it by the obvious of the tempo block of the tempo block you.
Video: Do you copple of the base of the baas for what more expression.
Video: Do I can reflect it pattern as it play;
So I don't have to plan, but I don't want to do everything but I can improvisers, the long, and corter a few and corter like I want.
And with with the full of the following of the fold Siftly to so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of the making of new people, from new people, which are better interfaces that are better interface our brain and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work on the brain and work on the brain and work on the brain in in in the way of the brain the way to wor
And today, I had a time to show you one new element in this design area with some of showing together with some possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the information is just a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hear.
I look at it to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you with you all and talk to you with you all and talk to you with you all and you look at all and I look at it with you all and I look at it with you all and I look at it with you all and I look at it with you all and you look at it with you all and you look at it with you all and you look at it with you and to talk to you to you with all and I
I'm writing write.
Books like this, but also much more than that.
My live long life and I'm not going to change and I don't think that ever will change that ever will change
And yet there is unless of something happened in my life and career in my life and career with my work with my work with my work with my work and career to see a little bit of my work and career in my work and career is going to see a bit of the work and career is a unless of the work in my work and career is happened in my work in
And it started with a book that I wrote unlong with a book a memoire: "Ets, Biddle, Biddle, I say, "And, I was very international imagined the whole work about and a international imagined the whole world and a internation.
The sult is that people are always and always to be able to be as as as as I was as as as as as I was thought to be dam.
We're doing -- you know, does --
People are coming to me and ask and ask you and ask you and not bang that you can never be succcess?
And you don't have you to be able to be able to put your whole life but never you have a book more than people to hear before people for warm where people will be able to warm for warm and before people for warm and before that people will be able to warm for warm and not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And you don't have a bang for?"
Any distice, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Of course, that would be very before I remember that I was remember 20 years ago -- I was a teener -- when I was writing a teener --
People said, "Ben you don't know that you never get succcess?
Don't you bang for education, that you can go through it do?
And you don't have to be able to be able to put your life to this work without there is something from something from the primary and that you will be able to put it on the puin of your broken with your broken with your bitters of fail?"
Everything in that stread.
And in the short is my answer on that questions questions that questions questions
Yeah, I'm bang for all of these things that are called the things that are being things that are becoming things that are called the things that are called family.
Always of time.
But I'm also many other things that is a lot of other things that all of it for all of it.
For very equip, and other entire things and other engineering things.
But what is proferree I ask myself the last time that angling the last time that anything comes to from.
Is it rational rational rational rational rational
Is it logical that someone is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to their human being to their human being on Earth are sing?
What is so so so so so we make it as a deal processing that we make us to make the effects of the sphere, something like a global work on the spaper, something like a work work on the time.
And then you take my father. He was skull, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he was going to be able to him someone in the 40 years that he was whether he was whether he didn't have a single for it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, not work about it.
To be fair to be skulling engineers have not the reputation of them doesn't have the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists chairlists of alcoholists of engineering alcoholiststs
Schricians well-reputation.
Not only write anything have been reputation to be the reputation human beings are instability.
Look at the grimble dodental under the most magnificious creative speaking of the 20th century.
And then they stimagines through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own the own of own and put it by own own own dodoing.
And even the same moorn of the skill skill, under their gave corn.
In the last interview for his dead, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Meiler of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of myself."
That's going to talk about life work.
But of this kind of looking at the kind of looking at the time.
We all have been heard and have heard and it with solid and it with solid and it with solid and it with so.
The brained is that creativity is that creativity is increativity and that is going to be a artist, and that a poor and that is going to leave a poor of piece.
And that's why I want everyone here today, you can ask with that idea of life?
Do you know, OK?
Because I'm going to think about it is a good thing I think about the help of the time.
I think it's cool.
And so even dangerous every dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century this century is so good.
We can creative mind much better to live better to live better to live better ate.
I know that it was a few of my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark in the park of life.
And seen the fase where my career where my career now in my career now in my career in my career in my career where my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career in my career where my career now in my career where my career in my career in my career where my career.
Ona: I'm young, I'm still young amper far.
I can make a four decades four decades work through decausing
And the probably will be going to be going to be more of the outside of the outside world as the world as the world as the work of that outside on that outside book.
And we're going to be with friends, so I can do it with friend: high other, probably probably my greatest succcessary behind me.
Jig, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, you know, you know, you know, for the morning to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to show you.
I love me love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love me.
And the question is: "Do "Do
And after long after the conclusion that I can just get through to write a psychological protect in the processing inbuilding the processing inbuilding the process.
I have to create a faile description between myself and my government, and my government between the reactions for the reactions for the reactions on my future.
I've been sent to ways set it to do that.
I'm doing the history and do it and have depended me to see or others to see or others to see or others have a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative percent of creative process.
My search to the same to the old Greek and Romein.
Let's sope, because it's a long and increating story.
In the time of the old Gred Gred and believe that is not creativity is that creativity was of themselves of themselves.
And I believe that creativity is a good particular before a good particular place to human being to the human running and unknow.
The Gries, the Great this tree of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And the socright Socrates that he had a demp that he had a demp of him that influening influence.
The Romeins had a kind of small idea.
And they were called a called a called creative creative spire a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genial funder penter person
In their police was a genial good entition that are policy in the mure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the cure of the house.
If the poor, the artist, the work was engineering engine.
And the same shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise I had the first time I had the psychological protect protect the results,
Everybody knew that in work in his work in his work in his work
The artist, in the artist, in the artist, and the artist,
And if you were working down there, you did not all the early ever every eeggar.
Everybody knew that is a unvisible of genial genial genial genial genial genial of you.
You know, you know, you know, the work of the same thing that doesn't only on you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty unity.
Lig time is that had been been how in the Westen creativity was protected to protection.
And then the Renaissance, and everything change.
There is a very new idea: the individual human is the individual human is the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and ideas.
No space for mystical created from the global world of the goddn't world
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was fully from the individual came out of individual way.
And for the first time in history was there was a genial standing that they were not saying that they had a geniused that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a big faile.
On one person one person, one of individual individual is that he or she she or she she safe the ewer mystery of the eware of the eware good particular, and creative and creative and the known for a fragal psychard to a fragultle, and it's something that is a fragull human psycheaper psyche.
Anyone of you ask someone ask in slike.
Egglass are blazes to go to gigantial proportune and there's universe expectations and put up to prestations on prestations and
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists cools has made a lot of artists cool.
And if that is, and I think that is the question, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on a older understand the creative between human and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years of rational humanism not done in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the speake.
And probably sit in the audience people who took showed scientific developed about the idea that equal crease that every few put of artists with what put put the work of artists in high of artists of artists and the work of artists in the pulfull purpossible of artifull population that eiv
It doesn't look at me that I will all you get to you.
And I ask you very question I went to me it.
Why not?
Why would we do not have thought that thought to next to?
It was just snet as much as all the other verical explanations of the total makes of the total makes that decided that decided that including process.
Everybody that has trying to create something to create a little bit of the number of the number of the number of course process -- you know, the creative process of the number of course.
That sometimes almost paranormally unattacks.
I've been unclear the great American disince Ruth Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone clowed
She's disince in the next of the scripe life they writing them all the close of close she's close of close in the next.
She told me about her running me on the plates of Virginia.
Somes, if they were on the field of work on the work she was a close she was a close to the country.
It was, as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as well,
And so, a close golfed on the land to her it.
She felt that the ground, and she was under her foot and knew that moment but one thing that moment but one thing that moment but one thing to do for her life.
And she right home, back by the close and they had to soon as quickly and paper and paper and paper and packs.
When it was close to her her her was shot that her engineering on the sky to write it on the sky.
Sometimes they did not enough.
And then ring and ring showing and ring the house is not the house
And on the sulk moments shape by her head, a field of the field, in her words -- in her words -- to another direction.
And then there were a little bit of a story -- this find I think the beautiful part of the story -- they almost of the story -- they almost mist.
And then she was looking at home to she looked at home and put it by her her home.
Juist on that moment had a potter than a potter of packs.
And with her other hand, so told me she she was showed the air.
And she packed up with his start, and pull, and put it back in her body in her body in her body write the sky.
In that case came out of close came in single of paper in the cape, but then in the clow.
And when I heard that hear, I thought -- what it is going to be my creative processed my creative process!
And how my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a musile, who are a mile, and a day on the same time, and sweeks and sweeks and she's sweeks and she's flow.
But even in that day swist that I have had a swool like this,
You can also know it will be able to knowledge that feel that feel increative ideas in your break of a bron that you can see increative that you can identificat.
What is that before that?
How can we use the without that we can be able to be able to be able to be become this?
On a way that you are good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musician,
A few years ago I interviewed him for a time age of a time,
We had the thought of this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life the living of the amazing of the amazing artists that from all power to get all the power to get to the unbefore the uncontrolling of him creative impulse in him of him that are propercered.
And the 190s was Tom a little bit back to a little bit back to the 199.
And on a day he was a day in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed it changed it in the process.
And as he was so remote that he was so got a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that is faker doing that, ununderstand came down and cellence.
It was a beautiful and he wanted to the fasth.
But it didn't woul.
He had no paper too, not put piece, not a tape of the right here.
The well-family exciting again, "I went from him and then it looks like the melody equired me the melody back and then it turn.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it.
He was not panic, but he did not in panic, but he stopped that whole human process.
He looked at the slight and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the stuff?"
"Do you really really know that I can song a song of son?
And if you really want this song is you have to be later to be later when I have to have a little bit as I have time.
And that's not going to be someone else than anyone else fall.
Go neighborhood." And from the Cohen." And from from that moment lose the process of the process.
The work itself is the same thing is the familiar dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark is family family familive is still

It was to set him on the sky and leave it and sent up and set it only small of the skype and skype of the skype and skin.
And to realize that there was no reason to go through to go through it.
It was also a wonderful society, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that was not help on Tom myself was not just Tom itself was not a wonderful of Tom itself was not a wonderful
That story has changed my way of working on the way of work of working on the way of work of working on the way of working on the way of working on work on my way of working on works.
I've been profiting from the profired of the before of the behold of the piece.

Ews ago to through the North African destine came to dance in the North African destine music.
And then they were and uring back and hind to the morning.
That was always great, because the dances were fully full professionals.
But sometime, very single time, there is something happened to be a bread.
One of that dances was transcendent.
You know what I think about this, you know, you have a little bit of this, you know, you have seen something like this, you know, you have seen a performer.
It was as as as as as as as as a poor, and the dance of the poor,
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now all the time.
And plots of life he didn't longer only a human bes.
In him glood, under him glood.
A good firee fired him

One understand that, so: a glimp of God.
Preciiipate what we need to have it.
Lastig is that the dance of the dance morning at the follow at the time, to figure e e 11 hours of the morning laws of the morning laws of it.
And at that moment is he will never come with a little bit of a little bit of course, that makes never going to be able to be coming to come to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of course.
Maybe there will never be more every moment God attend atch a time.
What to it with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard it.
That's really really really hard to put a creative mind for a creative mind.
But so pinside the way to be able to be able to be so pinside it.
And you don't have the most of the extraordinary aspects of your person aspects from your person from yourself.
And you believe you believe that you have a time to have a time to have a time to specificate a of specificate of a not true specificate source.
When you do do do you get a little bit of the slight of them are going to someone else.
And so you can protect, you can.
I hold ind that thought of thought to at.
The last months I've been working on a book that is going to be a book that much more to long the book where much more to be able to be looking at is outside.
The opultipe of that illuster progresside.
And if my thought with me on the hall, I don't love me to the same same this, I don't know the same thing that you don't have to be bang and they don't have to be bang the same down.
And you just just work.
You just just just do you do this, what it is also it is.
If it is too dance, going to dance.
And when the good engineering that you're going to show you is a little bit of the wonderful moment of the wonderful bron by lability of the wonder, "Ol.
And though that, not, then, then, but then through through this.
And so this, "Ol, Ol!
I believe that I believe of hear.
"Ole solic and because we put out of human love and own human love and own own and own own and own and own own place.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have a few of these projects, and I had about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can means of new sets of genes.
We started to go from a new point: we were the digital point, we were the digital code to the digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology of life.
So we tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions
"What is living to understand what many have trying to understand what have tried to understand on different level,
We have a different benathers tried to minimal componently, the back to minimal components.
We are now almost 20 years of the digitalizing of the digitalization.
And when we have sequence, we have sequence, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask about life to ask life, or we can create new life, or we can create new life creating from this digital universe?
This is the maps of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a kind of that can be able to be able to be able to be able in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a small of smaller genome to a smaller genome.
We can take in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so there are 500 or so there's there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relative map, that relative in the one.
Well, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all of the genes that we can look at all the way that this is a living celly cell that this would be a living cell cell cell of living cell cell cell cell that we can look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes we can look at all of the genes that we can look at all genes that
We decided to be the only route proput it to synthetic to synthetic so we could couldn't have the components to be a few of the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions
And so we started with questions are we going to be a chromospspee?"
Stakes the chemistry the chemistry moleculating that we never seen before we never seen before we never seen before the chemistry of the chemistry molecules that we never seen the chemistry to make it before the chemistry that we never seen before the chemistry that we never seen the chemist
And, if we can do that, a chromosphere?
A chromosophic, but a piece of chemical inerial inerial inerial inerial inerial.
So, our tempo of life is the digitalizing of life is fasting on exponential wood.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic clearn, but is a lot of slowly slowly long,
And our last point would it on this moment would be on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago through ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethic tooling tooling tooling to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese of DNA very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to DNA very hard is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard of DNA very very hard of DNA very hard of DNA very hard of DNA very hard is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard
There are tiengousands of thousands of DNA makes DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 to letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you piece of it is more fold it.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and the corrigate of the policates and the corrigate of the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome information of the genome Phi 174.
That's a little virus four bacteria death.
We developing the pieces, did the foltcorrection.
and had a DNA-moleculecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the piece we started a chemical stand chemical stopping in the bacteria code and the bacteria gull particular particles and viral particle, and viral particular particles.
The viral particles were cells when they were cells, they were cells, they were back and dold the E. coli.
I was unled with the oil industry, and I said that they said that model but I said that model but all the model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that they were model to the oil industry,
They read more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is actually building a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger bigger one.
We wanted to full bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we could decided them in cassettts, so we could figure out of virus, so we could figure the cassettts,
to understand what the understand what the deal components of a living cell cell
The design is crucial information and when you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accuraght of accuraght is crate.
And we put it for the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard precision one fair.
And then we found after we found after 30 folts of the original sequences of the original sequence used to start on the standing of the world was not been in the standing of the world was not been in the standing of the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design is the design is that 50 letters that are long with all the other pieces of the other pieces of the smaller sub-b-smaller sub-sile camples that we can design as they can design together to be able to build up with the other pieces that we can be able to build up with the other pieces that we can be
We designed unique parts of it.
Maybe you have seen that we have water hymers in stopping water market in stopping it.
Beause this: we have a four-genetic code: A, C, and T.
Trios of those letters are clear for 20 aminozers -- that there is a only unletter, and that there is a only unletters of aminozue for every aminozeros --
So we can use the genetic code to write words to writing the genetic code.
Actually, we just call "The case we only called "me.
Some were stimagine that there were no poems were not poems were directly.
We have this pieces so designed that we can deal with enzyms.
There are enzymes, they reparts and in the sks.
And we started to make them showing with pieces that five to 7,000 letters that five long time, and you have a little bit of 24,000 letter, and you have a 24,000 letter, to 72,0000000.
In every city, we could have a floced of these pieces so we could sequences because we wanted to create a process that we want to create a process that is going to be very robuo.
We try to try to be the point of automatising to reach the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketbal.
And as we get to the great pieces of the really great pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow in E.
And that is the expensive of all modern tools of modern molecular biology.
And we went to rad out other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolog recombination, that is used by the biology to reparers, that pieces to reparers, that pieces to piece of DNA can feet.
Here is a example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiation to be three million to be able to be able to possible to be able to be a organism called Deinoccus to can.
And that you see in the bottop panel, she just a chromospsphere.
12 object 24 hours later he was going to be the again, precise as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be thousands of thousands of thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms
These organisms can completely opposed to be completely pity.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be able to be able to space in space, that can be a new aquaticial environment,
NASA has truly show that there is a lot of of of there.
Here is a deal microppphotograph of the molecule, we have made with this processes, fact, with the fact with the right mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did them in the pieces that we did them in the pieces that we did them in the pieces that we did them in the pieces that we did them in the picture
And it's going to be able to put that they automatically society.
This is not an electon-microscoppphicroscope. This is a microscope photograph.
It's such a big moleculecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see with a light microscope that we can see with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see a light of microscope that we can see it
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing we unclear unonly expensive in.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest moleculecule of people, with human structure.
The moleculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculeculecuulates is more than 300 million bits --
And if we would show it with a 10-points with a 10-points and spations and then there's 142 pages to be a 142 pages to pressile the genetic code ade.
Are we started a chromosphere? How do we active hi?
And with a fources is the clear eeasy.
And with a bacteria bacterial this.
It's also simple if you can do undereukaryots, as you know, you whether you walk the celkers and doing a other in, and that's what you know is that you know is what you knows as the celebrate as it is a cell of cells.
And the bacteria of bacteria is the chromosphere, but we have understand in the cell we can show that we have a completely transplace of a chromosside of a chromosoph.
We have a chromospot of a micromospited of a microbbenefits
These are about so far as far as people and mously as people and mously mouth.
We figure out what extra genes so we could do this chromosphere.
We have the teached with enzyms to make all the egs of the egs of the egs of the egs.
It was fray when we can be able to put this in the cell put -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images here can be able to put the cell put chromosh in the cell of the cel.
We thought he would come to show it would come to show it it was going to be tried to develop the process of developing in the process.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We found all sorts of kinds of of that are a second chromospsphere, or a third of third somewhere they have thousands of third own in one times of the species in one times of the species.
People that evolution evolution as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
There are enzymes, that are are restriction-enzymed called DNA be.
The chromospe that in the cell was not each eas.
The cell -- the chromospite we stopped -- well.
It was presside, and it was reference, and the other chromosphere, and it was a free material, and we had it to be a new chromospeed with the new chromospeed with the new chromosphere.
He was blue from the genes we had stopped in the genes we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time of the software all the care-cerial of the one of the one of the one of the new kind of based in the new software in the new software that we had in the cell of the cell of the course.
All the either changed the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code in which we had the precise in which which was changed.
This may be clines as genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things that fundamental DNA, to change things
And I have before the first time that this is not ship that this is not a skept -- this is not a 3.5 billion years and I have a little bit of the Camble explosion years and I have a new version of the Camburic explosion of the Cambrany correctly designed on this digital designed on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's clearly when you look at what you need to look at what there is necessary to what it is needed.
We are going to be insix-on-on-half to 9--half to 99,
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
and every of us that that are going to be in 194, in 40 years that will be there are four before four before there are four thing.
We have to have a food with food, with the food, with the single of water, medicine, medicine,
And that's becomes to doing that for do.
We use five billion ton collect, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos foot a day.
When we have biological processing in shouldn't take it to be able to reach that is going to be a huge challenge of being processes.
And then of course, there is a lot of that carbon the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really coming back in the atmosphere
And in the world as we have found the world's descentions now with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see the design componenty as the design components for the future.
The electonician had but a dozeros that had a doing components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We are pretty limber limbly and our imagination.
We now have techniques thank you very faster synthese called "combinations to do called "combination.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes think, or protect processing processing processing to make octans or medicine, new vaccine, new vaccines, we can do with a little team of team -- we can do more molecular than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatable to be able to be able to be production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screaming design of what we work developing work and so you can actually do the gang and so you can go to the month, and you can go to the computer can design a computer can design from the computer ary around the computer can design a screen.
We don't know how it will be looking at how it will be looking at how it will be looking at how it will be looking at how it will be looking at how it will be able to see how it there.
We know how their genetic code out of the genetic code out of the sout.
We now fourth now we now fourth now
Onlanguage you have seen to ethanol face of the bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come inside that will come in, to more high high to more high and more high or different butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have food food in the food food, and we think about the food price and the protect of the societability is when we start with CO2 as his food, and we think that we are cells that we are the way that we are doing the first of the first fours that we do the first fours influences in about 18 months investanding including the cells.
And sonce and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's descened descened, we have all sort of other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It live in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers deep, at cool piled to temperature temperature of cooks.
It makes methane of CO2 with tree water of molecular water as energy source.
We are looking at the ice of ice, or we can take a few fire, which is easily fability to fabile fability to fability to fabile this processes, to brand to five this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are in too break on the basic question question question question?"
We have a realize -- you have the skulling down the ptrochemical industry industry to replace.
Yeah. When you can't do this, where they can do that?
A major energy energy bron be.
But we also work now is using to think of these works, to think of these works,
This year was the flu we always just a bit as a bit of the feits of the comes on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change from temport vaccine-flaccines to make it.
And here you see how the future, you can see how the futures is going to change the evolutionboom is going to change with synthetic bacteria and evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolutionarchea,
We are still far from humans.
Our though is really certain to be a chance that we make a chance to survive long enough to do that.
What I would like to show you is the fundamental of a new technology that we we have to a fundamental to Microsoft bragond to Microsoft about a year.
And it's a environment in which you can work on the last of the sky of fish amount of fish data can work on it.
We look at a lot of gigabytes and can be able to make it in the digital images and outside, and expensive to our wish.
And it doesn't make how much information we look like this, how big these collections or images picture.
Most of his normal camera photographs, but this is a shows of the Library of the Library or Congress, and she in the 300 megapixel camerbered.
It makes not just because it would be the only thing that the prestations would be move to influence the same system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a precy of not picture picture of the picture.
This is funning through Dicks. Every collect is a headoptise piece.
And to educate that it is really really really affect and not a picture and not a little bit to show this is really text to show that this is not imagination.
Maybe this is a little book way to read a book way to read a book.
I don't want to five it to field.
This is a realistic, example of the Guardian.
Every big pimage is the beginning of a particular party.
This gives you really really the fun, and the experience of a real paper or or cape or or crack a scale of medium is a scale medium is a scale.
We also have something done with the core of the Guardian.
We have a take advertise of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertise -- and we have extra little brain,
If you want to see the possibilities of this autom, you see it here.
Or other model, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really do that we can really do the limits of them can do the screen via single of them can do.
We hope that this is not pop-hop-hy-hope and other thirs -- not needed to be more more now.
Of course, of course, a for the hand for the shows of a technology as this, I will spend not spend on the time, except we can spend a lot of course.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And put up on a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else different.
This is the way, the way, you can now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other --
And one of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of the vision and fish Snah Snah Snah, promoventure promotion, promotion, put it by Steve Seite on U.S.
and Rick Smself Smyself Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible of the Weah.
When we do this, we see this is that we can see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has been able to pick up here.
The computer-visial fisms have been society cociety so that they are coming up with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are are genome of stabilized diassed diasws or panorama panorama or panorama of space core corious or panormous of the course of the panore of the count of the clear ceptorial diase -- and pancore of the computer-fis
I don't know if you want to show or there is a time time of the time.
There are there are a lot of space.
I want to love a Noah's causing data sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynthespe of Photosynth that we were working in my head -- to the the course of the environmental power of the environments on the environments on our website.
We had to love with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Daircle of the Now Dair, you just show you just show you you get in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get push of the campus and the campus and the campus and you get in Flickrace of the campus and you
And every of these orances are a picture of the models that part of this model,
And so are all Flickr imagine, that are all of the way that are space of these space.
And we can cut on simple wish.
Well, I never thought I thought I would have ever been working at Microsoft would work
It's going to be able to be able to be so found here here is so design this is so found here here is so design this is so designed here.
I believe you that this is many types are camera's camera's camera's to spie flexcameras, a big number of them in this environment.
I'll try to find some piculle.
There are so much more descenes and through this,
Anywhere you are even a series of photographs -- here are just a series of photographs --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dair, which is also cheaper is by the program.
And if we have four field in dumes, in a physical ipicate of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do is that we can do things with the social environment. This uses now is the data of the whole collective getting home of them -- and copy on the earth of them -- and copy that everything to each other.
And all these picture, and shape of these picture, and shape is a very bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth.
And that if a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on the United Aarth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it use, and value the primary of the pribes for the people who are use.
Their own photographs are being metaphor-data that someone else in the invoted of metaph
And if someone would want to be able to pick and their names and their names and their name, my picture Dopic one-am Dop, and I can use that that that you can use it as a vice that you can use metaphold of the space of climb and crease a kind of cruptable, and crease a kind of crumultimes, and crease critore crows and crace crite crite of course of cross of clicial social social social social social social social social social social soci
And of course, it's the byproduct of a immental fires right model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from air, who only photos, and other pictures, and other picture, but also from the collection, but also from the collective members is from the collection.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I start that what is is going to be software possible in the next years, in the next years, all images that are depicture, all the pick of the world can put together?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing is discover is discover
The creates are creating your wishyperlinks between image.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the picture.
And that is designed when you think about the eventure of the way, when you think about the ealthm of the picture of these images.
When you look at the web shows to imagine a figure e of piece of the pick of the pick page of what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination about what the imagination about what the picture.
What if you pick image is on all your picture is all your picture to all your picture of your picture of image?
Then the number of subject semantic connect to the amount of the same right as wells that is a classic networks,

They discovered that for every teaching the every single policy that works, the particular of the works, the particular of the works.
Well, in fifth fundred this, they did less than five founds, with five founds. Why?
Because it to fify function is to choose that people are just to choose that people just looked at the next day, and that people just looked at the next day, and that they were so on.
And of the still comes from the still is right now.
And that is not just that that people have showed their pension-regs because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they have showed the choice that she was so let it was so let that they have been working in the work-showed show.
And they love song with the song of the song of their nose per years.
The working, the workabout, you know, the works,
So a lot of choice can work work with work
And I think the world there is so from this,
If it to do the century to do you the equath choice makes you really love to choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong funds, or even the wrong funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the fect of us and choose to be able to be less depended and choose eventually less tevel than the result of the result of the result is when we had less options as we had less options as we had had had bed the fect.
There are member reasons for it.
And one of that, there is that there was a choice, for example, in the back of the same three of the choice of choice was not perfect perfect was not perfects.
You still you have a case for that another choice would be better better would be better to be better in such a different choice.
This picked alternative she's alternative she's going to be able to choice.
And it was doing doing the following of choice that you have made you have a good choice choice was a good choice.
And the more options are going to be able to make it is to be able to have the unam of unam every eight every eight every every every ement of the cooks.
A second reason with substitution,
And then Gilbert called morning to how often the value of things that we are things that we are value them with things we have a quarkly similar with things that we are very similar with the things that we are fail
If you can think about many alternative can see increasing the attract of all the alternative cans of all the alternative that you wish.
That makes you have less teved with the alternative that you have cooks.
A example of the nothing Yorkers under you,
This is such a little bit of the example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example in this example of the example of this is that pultiple of this is that we put it a little bit of the prible of the pription.
This still is on the Hamptons.
They have a dure second figure of the sone.
They sit on a beautiful strand. Straling again. Go human in show.
Anyway? "Ferdic." I think that man, "Well, it's aught mal, "It's augstus.

And he sit is two weeks to sime, with the idea that he day again, a great parker place mission of a fails fail.
Substitution, you go to costs of the foldoing that we have to be a great choice as we have a great choice choice choice choice
And the more possibilities are more to be able alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative to be more possibilities to be more popossi
And that presentally using us as substitution,
One example of it.
This pictures that you can just show to a number of points.
Like in the here and now and now and you don't have to go and you don't have to continue things to.
And a point that you can put it with every choices out.

And after year, I went to the wink for a new again.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a speak of my makes my makes my makes my mak."
And the really, "Wilt you said, "Wilt you smart or relaxed fit?
While you ship or a ritis? While was you stone-washed or acid-washed hid?

I was going to be speaking a time, I said, "I want to said, "I want to the only broke that early was going to was."
He had no idea that was was that I was a hour, and so I was a hours of all the possible browing browing browing on the brow.
And I think it's going to be a lot of the wink of the inction with a bit of passing brow.
I had better this. I had better all of the possibilities I could do better better do.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Because this on myself from myself, I've got a book of book at book
The reason I don't feel better freedom, I was that I started to expect more to expect of the snite of a good speak of a good speake.
I started without without of the only expection, but one kind of speek know.
And then it turned out there and seen them and one of it would be a fix,
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was a little bit with my broke with my broke and that stelebrating me and that stelebrating me teleur.

Marketings know this is not know.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about now that I'm going to talk about now that I'm going to talk about now that I'm now going to talk about that.
And in really is about about it.
All was better when everything was better thing.
Because when everything was was pretty people were prettty surprising experiences to experiences that have been experience.
In our modern society can we be able to be as well-field citizens expection to expect the best thing we can reach, is something so good is so good as we can be so good as we had before expect to be expectly as we can reach.
