But this is the reason of this particular problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice of ice.
The ice close capture, in a sense of the climate of our global climate system.
It put in the winter and crach in summer.
The next slide I show is a speed version of what happens is happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice ice is divided in red.
As you can see, it take it from dark blue.
That's the early ice ice during the winter.
And the crack in summer.
The so-called ice, five years or older is almost like blood, is almost like blood, which is from the body here.
In 25 years of this is going to this in 25 years of this is going to this in 25 years of this to this cle.
And that's a problem because the frozen ground the North Icel, and there are a very big warming and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon carbon or carbon or did carbon methan, when it designs designed in methan.
Compassion with the total response in the atmosphere, would double, that could double, that could double the catmosphere.
In some of the deep of the deep in Alaska break of the water.
Professor Katey wind Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another undeep of undeep more.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real.
A reason for that, is that this huge warmte, "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt of serriver.
The water volume is the bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuage suage of Southwest Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea level that is because the landice of the sea legs where it comes in the sea legal where it comes in the sea legal comes in the sea.
These sturings are taking flocks.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the south polite mass on Earth.
And last months scientists scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole very quickly very quickly on the south Pole, with some underwater islands.
The whole continent is six feet of six feet of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice mass, there are now new now, that were now now that were a few years ago from still glaciers were still glaciers were nowing.

In the Andes, this glassroom of drinking water for this city.
There are now more points.
But when they disappear, it also dwins the drinking water.
In California 40 percent in California 40 percent in the snow of Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water reserves.
And as you could read in the predictions are the predictions of it.
This worldwidea of dramatic dramatic styclean stycle.
And the number of nature, all over the world is subject with an incredible and never seen speed.
Four last year, in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unrelently impactable.
If you look at the point of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 for 10 million tons of CO2 hours.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, which is good to the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, west vasto, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drops of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, is design deeply designed for 20 percent money, is the burns of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and it's all the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extters, sings with China.
And there was a lot of more urban centrality to build much more steps.
But we see a reverse of this.
These are the voice carbon centrales that the building was annulearned in the last few years and where green alternatives were fored.
There's a political battle on the country.
The voice carbon and oil industress gave 250 million dollars to promot, which is a carbon for "scale carbon clean carbon of scene.
And that image me to something like that.
And, the current was at at Tennesse, about four billion literary gallon gallon model model move model,
You probably seen the news of face.
This is the one-largest depending in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising carbon the cool was done of the Kerst.

We find that it's clean -- and it is still clean.
So, you don't make a worry about climate change.
Let me remember.
Video: Acture: Schone carbon for a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean city-carbon clean central.
Fantastic! The machines are making a little law.
But that's the sound of clean urcarbon clean technology.
And despite the fact that the burning of cool is one of the major causes of the Earth, change warming causes of the Earth, change clean city clean technology that you see all here.
And look around the clean urban technology today.
Al Gore: Al Gore: The positive alternative alternative with our economic challenges on the area of national security of national security of national security of national security for national security of national security of national security and the area of national security
Video: Stem: America in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The red wire in all of these things is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pollution and inmported oil.
But now a bit of new solution to get to the resolution to this is to get here.
By America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to get a plan that makes us safer and the surface of the Earth counter-to-of Earth catch.
And finally a solution that is a similar enough to solve our problems.
Reapply America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about America.
One of the fastest ways to make an ended on our dependence to our dependence of old view, which is the planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good pay good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking quickly says, "If you want to be a quickly one.
If you want to go to and you go to and get together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduce about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am -- for those who were not one: the LHC is the most LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment ever in the currently experiments,
It has to be the circumstances that were present less than a billion second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitiously, so, so,
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in building so you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That was a party for a party certain the controllect room.
It's a picture of the first particle-strel that who's all the LHC went around with a piece of the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with particles in the detector of the LHC, and the detector of the LHC in the detector of the LHC to be currently around the LHC in the detect of the first cracious of the LHC in the detect of the LHC in the detect of the LHC and the detect of the bones in the LHC, and with a piece in the way around the way around the detectort of HHHC, and with a photograpiest of HC, and with a pief HC, and with a phot of the detect of the detectort of the detectort of the detectort
In other words, when we knew that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine works, which is a huge overwin, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this was the biggest of the biggest of this, or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden to these golden with these golden disads.
They were doing 13 thousand amper purpose when the machine on full force on full force on full force on full force that we were full in the full force on the full force of the machine on the full power of the machine on full force on full force that we were full those in full force that we were full in full force that they full those in full force that they full force the machine on ful.
The engineers are going to say, "Not whatever they're too small carring."
They can do that because they are superceive are in whole low-temperaturs.
So at multiply 271 degrees than the space between the stars, that can draw draw that stream being primary that stream being prime in 271 that are drags that are drags that are drags in 271 degree.
In one of the connections between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was something that was a bit of a warmer, and there was a electric weather of 13 thousand amper camper of electric weather than thousand amper course.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realizing that the magnets more than 20 tons of tons and they were about 30 centimeters inch more than 20 centimeters.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now, they are back in the way away.
Eind multiply the LHC will be intact.
We will put it again, and we expect measurements in June or June or June so we can go to figure out what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have the unhappiness that the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research a to research of the value.
I think it's so hard to think it's so hard, the fact that we are going to be further than ever ever the LHC.
I leave the last words on English scientish scientish Davy, Davy, during the decision of the value experiments of his teachers of the learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous than the subject of human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the mind that there are no images in nature, that there are no res in the experipensive in the world, and that there are no definitely that there are no definitely definitely ded to definitive the definitely definitely Ds of the ded defiefections of the des of the bt depencish scribuils of the ded experive, and of the scrive, and that there are no res of the ded experive
Thank you very much!
I would like to start with you to go back to your childhood at your childhood at your childhood at the clocks of toys.
When you discovered how you had to understand she had to solve and conscious problems to learn by the decision by the depended with and depended up with and depended up with and depended up with and depended up with the deck of the decided to solve and detect with the dect of the device relationship, and then you found the deck of the device relationships and discovered to solve the problems of the deteach and dealt with the problems of space relationsheart with the deculated to solvils of spach and with the ded relational relationsing relationsh and with the b, and with space relationsace relations;
Rumble insight is stronger because the understand the world to understand us.
If an information inspired by physical interaction with physical interaction with objects -- together with my adviseur Pattion and my fellow worker Jeevancing -- I started to ask me -- what if we were a computer place in that encount of mouse point that is a kind of digital fingers that moves in a place of the movinger in a place of the information that moves in a place of information that we can flask in a place that we ung in a plates that that they can found, we unk in the pattend information that encleflassize cerate with a kind of information that ensize of the htach of information that encoration that encorbursus of the around information that enc
and orders as we want?
This question to see us so so that we decided to see a answer to seech a building of Siftables.
Short is a Sift-up interactive computer size of a single of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can be able to put each other, and they can detect a screen and they contact a screen and wireless contact --
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded of blocks they can be moved by understand the blocks of it.
And in the top of the way of digital information, a new ecosystem for the manipulate of digital information.
And so that this tools have a more physical different distinction and even of their movement and even of their movement and even of the way we move and even of the way we move and even of the way we move new and leak interactions and funning new and leak interactions of the way we have new and leak interactions of the movement,
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftis institude to show a video that plays, that by cancing plays, and others and others and others played played and others played the back of the back of the reason the back of the point of the same and plays, and otherwise plays, and othersice played this Sift is played to
And these interactive portraits are awareness of awareness.
And they are also next to each other, they will interest in each other.
If they are surrounded it and they can do this and can be able to do this and can be able to do this.
And they feel and she feel and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interaction, as it was a color as it was a color as a color as it was a fluid -- a fluid was a fluid -- it was a fluid --
In this example three Siftable, and I can use them to go color in a lot of the currently in a lot of where they are getting mixed to be college.
If we have drive, we put some back.
There are some clever possibilities for education, pretty gamely with language, mainly play with language, and logics where people want to give things quickly so. And logics to see things fast.
Here's the developing of a Fiban development of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic realculating programmmatic realities -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci acci
Here's a game to show that a cross-writing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every randomly get in every Siftable, and shaped words are controlle, and send words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is a 30 seconds, it appears with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the working out of it and make it trying to make it and make a video of making it out of a video of making a video of it.
They were actually going to be able to go from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have almost no instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people at the test of the other people at the test.
That's our young batta tester, right?
And it seems that he just just the Siftable.
For him was just this blocks.
Here's a interactive painting showed in an interactive paints.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftly with the Siftly with that character of the table.
Here's a sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good didn't done Yeah!
By the shape of Siftable, and the next to shape the characters with each other -- Video: Wely!
DM: and so his own story tell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decides how it decision.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed recent developed a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
One has 40 different variations, where you can use what you want to do you to use.
And these sounds can be injected in empty Siftable, so you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the point of a leading Siftly as available of live controlled live controlled as reverb and filter.
They are to a sound a sound and adapted by side.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the entire pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftables, to a extra lead.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feel a little bit of slaggwork.
Video: And now I came to the filter to the filter to the drums, so I can influence the effect of live live live in the effect live in the drums, so I can influence the effect of the drums, so that I can influence the effect of live live in the drums, so that I can infideo: And now I
Video: I can accelerating the obvious accelerating the office.
Video: Well, I built the filter to the basassroom for the more expression.
Video: DM: I can reproduce the pattern whereas it plays.
So I don't have to do anything to plann, but I can improvise the longer and make it a bit longer and make the shorter as I want.
And at finally the dims of the volume of the volume of the volume to the left shape to the left of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume
Thank you.
As you can see my passion from making new people, to make new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are still in the way our brain and works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of possible possibilities that we develop the developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring is that this is just the same to a very new generation to be a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hearts.
I look at it to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk.
I'm writing writing.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long for a long time I say writing that ever will change it.
And yet there is something understanding in my life and career through I had to see my relationship with my work with my work rein.
It started with a book that I did written un-written memoire: "Eten, Biddle -- Bidd," that very opposed to my first work work and went to my first work and an international exist.
The consequence is that people are always to me and always that I have to be currently anywhere I do to be dam.
What is what -- too, does what --
People come to me and ask me and ask to me and ask to me that "Don't you at this success is never even?
Don't you afraid you will be your whole life will be write to be public but never public to be heat where people will be walk for warm to be hearing for warm to be walk to be walk to be write to be write to be write to be write to be write your whole life is going to be write to
You don't have a afraid for?"
Erg disinction, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I remember that I was runm 20 years ago -- I was a tener -- if I told a teenage -- I was writing to become a teently --
People said, "Don't you get to success?
Don't you afraid for dediction, that you will go on through it.
Don't you afraid you live to this work in the work of the broken without that there is something from the puts of your broken dron dreams with your mouth of broken dying with your mouth fiel?"
Something in that stretch.
And in the shortly comes to the shortly of the questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called to be called
Always the same thing
But I'm also much other things that you don't want to know what you want to do is not worth for all of that.
For sea for example, and other one stuff.
But what is writing writing to myself the last time that comes from, where that fear comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be the work for the work for the work that they are in the world?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects on the spirit of the work of the work of work at all.
Take my father. He was a chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he worked on the 40 years that he was working on the obvious or he didn't be afraid to him.
And so I said, "You're the way to your chemistry block block clock?"
No, so didn't be talking about it.
And to be fair to be fair engineers have been through the centuries of the centuries of the reputation that are piece of manical depression of manical alcoholists.
Sudght writers that have such a reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have apparentation mental reputation mentally instable.
Look at the griming death death the most magnificent creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own own own to be doing own to be doing own to be a lot of show.
And even those who are not suicide no suicide to be able to sweeks.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a kind of a bit about your life work.
But of this sort of exciting the kind of inside of the excition.
We all heard it before and have it before and have it all accepted it all accepted.
The hearing thought is that creativity understanding is that creativity to be connected with suffering and that a artistance.
And so I want to do anybody here today to be ask with that idea life?
Well, you know, OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think the whole doesn't do pretty didn't think.
I think the realize of the realize of the same thing
And also another dangerous.
I won't see that this century is that this is going to be so much as well.
We can creative minds much better to live forward.
I know sure it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, to be dangerous to the dark of the dark of the dark of the mind.
Some the phase where my career in which my career now is now.
OK, I'm young, I'm young, a young,
I can may be a four decades.
Huastprobably will be all the time, is going to be published by the extraordinary that the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up with friends, so I can slap you probably slight is my greatest success, I think about my biggest success,
And Jem, what a idea!
If you think about it, you're going to be in the morning to be neaking at nine hours to the neak hours of the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me work with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work of wood.
The question is: "Heood?"
And after long after a long time I can only go to write with writing to write with writing in the process inbuilding inside the process inside of the process inside of the process inside the process inside of the process inside of the process of inside as I think of a psychological protect in the process of the process of
I have to writing a safe destance between myself and my considering myself and my overage for the response response to my future reactions on my future publications.
I did the last year to ways to ways to ways that to ways to ways that thing.
I have been doing in history and have me floors in other societies to see if others have found a better way to see the creative people to deal creative people to deal with the emotional complicative percent of creative process.
My search has taken me to put me in the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let's op, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity coming from they're disince of themselves.
And believed that creativity was a divitable, who was a dive, unknowledge place to the human-to-human-reasonable reasons.
The Greeks now called this called the spirits of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon on that he had a demon wise words.
The Roman had a kind of a kind of a similar idea.
And in them some of the called creative spirit was a geniused to a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, is a particularly pended up with a genius.
In their promised was a kind of magical divity divital entity that are in the walls of the artist.
And a little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists was working on the work was the genius of the genius.
And he gave shape he gave shape work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the destance that I had the earlier protection to the results.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artists was so in protection in protect for example, to be a lot of narcism.
If you were work to you came to you have not been all the early one.
Everybody knew that a knew that you had a holpe.
You know, you work on the work of you work that not just a lot of you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time is that the whole creativity was creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual human is the individual humans is the point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attended to the divine world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual.
And for the first time in history was the artists of artists said that they were a genius, and not that they were a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big mistake.
And in fact, one person is to be one person, one individual individual that he or she or the fats is the essenti, the source of the century of the century mystery of everything is distinction and the famous is to responsibility for a fragility for a fragile human psyche.
as if you ask somebody to sunk the sun in swell.
Egos are blowing up to hugantic proportions and there are unimaginable expensions to express expensive expensive to experience in explain.
And I think this pressures the last 500 years a lot of artists has made a lot of artists
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back in an older understanding of the relationship between the ment, and the creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Well light we can do 500 years of humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes.
Probably in the audience people who have trial tools have doubt doubt about the idea that elphysics of the few that eliminated in the work of artists to inspiring artists to inspirate artists to inspirate artists to inspiring artists to inspirate artists to inspirate the work of artists
It doesn't seem to be getting you all of you.
And I went to windown.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that didn't have the mind?
It set as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the total uncompaniesed that decided that decided in the creative process.
And everybody who have a trying to create something to create -- so in fact -- so in fact that the creative process here -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process is rational.
That sometimes almost paranormal.
I have recently recently the wonderful American close Ruth Stone meet.
She's in the nine-destruck she close.
She told me her jeuth, she told me on Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field, she was a poem on the country.
It was, as if there was a big wave air, as if there was a big wave air.
And so you know, poem wave than the country to her
She felt that the ground under her feet, and she did that the shape that the moment but one thing to do is stonly one thing that is to stop lifetime to live her life.
And she had to go home, back home, and she had to see the pick and paper and paper and paper to see pack and see pick up to pick up and see them so quickly possible.
When the poem through her was her to write was that her only to write it on the oddrop of it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
And then rench and run, but the house, not.
And in the moments school poem the poem through her -- in the search -- in the search -- in the words -- in the words -- to another closer -- to another closer -- to another closer -- to another disappear.
And the reality of them were also -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- they almost mistic.
And then she was in home looking for paper and paper and paper the poems through its it.
Juist on that moment she had a potcil of a pencil
And with her other hand, she told me she poeded the poem from the air.
She picked the poem in his tail, and it pulled it back in her body, while she wrote the writing.
In that cases the came came to the poem well-well-fish in the paper -- but then in the following order.
When I heard that -- I thought -- what happens to be so decided to be my creative process.
This is how my creative process isn't medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mulle, which every day on the same time, and the same time, and sweating with blood, sweates and trans through it, sweates and trans through it and sweats on the same time.
But even in that daily swer daily I had a bit of an experience.
You will also know it will also know that there are creative ideas that there are creative ideas in your counrels from a source from a source that you can identified to identify that you can identify impossible to identify that you can identify it impossible to yourself, and you can identify it to identify it myself, and you
What is that then that source?
How can we use the without we are crazing?
On a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I think is musician example Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way to do it about this.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been showed to be the showed of the same way of the power artists that from all power to the unform on the unfortable creative impults that invity.
With the 1990s Tom a little roost.
And one day he referred in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of radical.
While he got to be drived to be a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that is does understand the inspiration of the bar, understand the welling.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to be the hold.
But that was not going to be that.
He had no paper top, no paper at the tates, no taperecority to them.
The well-familiar exciting exciting exciting the melody who are the melody that is remains me the melody eyes me eat, it turns out to be the backype of the windown.
I'm not good enough, I can't am it right."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sature of the sheat?"
"Do you really think I can describe now a song of the song,
If you really want to get that this song is to take a later another one of time, when I have time for you.

The work itself is the same thing that is the same dark of the dark of the dark of the same top.
But the heavy spance that creative process in him currences in him currently from the genius.

It could also be a wonderful, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own aspect that not quite at allow to Tom himself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had already had a profoundly of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biddle.
And a case moment I did in despair.
You know that well: you want to be a very well-reflect disaster in a terrible disaster disast.
Not just the side of the bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad
I wanted to do the whole project already to be the whole project.

And I said, "Listen then, "Listen then, we know all the both is not just by me.

Tja--- it's coming up comes on down here.
Engnite came in the North African desert desert people to dance in the sact of music.
And then hours and hours and hours of the morning comes to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were full full professionals.
But sometimes very single happened, something happened.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean, you have ever seen anything about a performer.
It was as if the time and the dance of time and the dance of a pator.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights for everything.
He didn't seemed to be a human being.
In him, under him, under him glourselves --

Maybe never going to have anybody God attack during his dance.
What to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to squarter for a creative spirit for a creative mind.
But so painful it doesn't have to be the point of it.
Imagine you don't have the most unusual aspects of your person common from yourself.
Imagine that you believe them a while of a which, you have a while of not too specificate source.
When you're ready to anybody else. They spending to somebody else.
That's what the side is considered everything.
I depended up inside that thought of thought.

So just the work.
Let's do the thing you just do is doing your thing, which is it is.
If you task you to dance your task.
If the dival genius that you is decided to decide in your work at some point of the wonderful sources of the wonderful source, then "Olle!"
And the thing happens not, dance dance but do.
And then then, "Ol!
I believe that I believe about hearts.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I've had a couple of these projects, about a few of the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean of genes.
We actually start from a new point: we were the point: we were the biology to the digital code to digital code to a new phage to go to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology to design life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand understand on different levels.
We tried different approachtions, the returns of the minimum to miniimum components.
We're almost 20 years at the digitize of digitizing for alize
When we have sequenced, the human genome of the analog world of biology, to the digital world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask in the course, we can create live to create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of a laboratory-close in a laboratoryed in a laboratory;
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nice smaller genome.
We can put in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so, that are there are are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively relatively simple to the onnail with the onyes.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the piece of the piece of the cell is that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell cell of life.
We decided that the only route condition was to synthetic this chromosome of the components to synthetic so that we could dedicate the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as we started with questions: "Can thetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic syn
The chemistry the chemistry the chemistry that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, a chromosome, "a chromospsome?
A chromosome, married is a piece of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of digitize the digitize of life is accement on exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code of writing the genetic code of a slowly slowly --
And our last point would place it would places on an exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago, over 15 years ago.
There were a number of stage, to start with a bio-ethic dealing provide of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, the more than you make it mistakes are more mistake.
So we had to put a new method for the collision of these little pieces and corns and corners of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt of the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that death.
We designed the pieces, did the pieces did the correction.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the bacteria piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria stop, and the bacteria code genetic code went and make viral particles were going to make and make viral particles went to make a piece of chemical particles went into the bacteria currently started reading the inerning of the bacter
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they came back from the cells, they were death, and death the E. coli.
I was until I was unning with the oil industry, and I said they model but already too well.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which the software o-eyed software o-ey-building system.
But we wanted to be much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so that we could varians virus, so that we could varian.
to understand what the real components of a living cell components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that are digital information in the computer than that are very accurate.
When we first first put together in 19995 was the standard in 19995 was the standard of 10,000 baseparated per 10,000 baseparated pares.
And finally we found after the resequencing of 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence was not in the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that have to design with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build in 50 letters to build so that they can design so they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can go to design so that they can design in the design of the design of the design is that to design as a lon
We design unique in the parts of the unique of this.
Maybe you have read that we read water notices.
And thought, we have a square a squarter genetic code: A, Go's Gend, Go's and T.
Trios of those letters for roughout 20 aminose -- that there is a only unletters -- that there is a only unletters for each aminozero-room cup.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentence, sentence.
And at signed we only called "We're just multiply.
Some were teleurged that there were no poems were no poems were not poemb.
We have designed these pieces that we can eath them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they put and they put in each other.
And we started making pieces of them to piece with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were long time, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 72,0000.
In each stage, we could have a consider the flow of these pieces of sequences because we want to create them to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be a business.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of the basketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketball of it looks like a basketbasketbasketbasketbasketball of this basketbal.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basevices -- then they don't grow so easy in E.
That remodern the except of all the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to rack in other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologist, which is used by repart of the biology to repay by repart of DNA to repay that pieces can feed a bit together.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million rad rad to radiation in opportunity.
You can see that in the top panel, she just clear.
12 objects at 24 again, he put it in each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dried around the
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can find in space that can find a new aquatical aquatical environment.
NASA has married shows that there is a lot of of it, there's a lot of of that is there.
Here's a real micropphone of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually used with these processes -- actually with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we were in them.
Gist makes that they can add automatically concern.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a commicroscope picroscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we have recently expensive to the recents.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is over 300 million.
If we would take the pressures with a 10-points letter, and then there is 142 pages pages only to pression the genetic code away.
Well, how do we start a chromosome? How do we activate?
With a virus is the clearly correctly easy.
With a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you decided to you under eukaryots, as we just put the cell number of the cell number of the cell and that is what you know if it cloth.
And in the bacteria species of the bacteria of the cell transplant in the cel, but we have showed a full transplantation of a chromosome of transplantation of a cell to another, and it can activate a cell to another, and it can activate a full transplant transplant to a different species in a different tr
We have a chromosome. We have a chromosome.
These are about so far from each other as people and mously away as people and mously mously as people and mously mously as people and mously accutter.
We add some extra little bit so that we could select to be selecting to select the chromosome of the experience.
We have the reflect with enzymes to make all the proteins of the proteints.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought that he would come to be just to develop the process of developing the process of a process of developing the process of a beyone.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of kinds of chromosome of the second chromosome of the third of the third of thousands of properties in a thousands of properties in a species.
People who are evolution to evolution evolution as if there have a lot of biology that has been able to be a lot of biology common.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that actually dived DNA resource.
The chromosome that was not ever evated in the cell has not ever eat.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop in it -- well,
It was expression of the other chromosome of chromosome of the other chromosome of the material, and why we had the next only with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the other chromosome of the cell chromosome of the material, and it alone, and it only the other chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cel
He became because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the species, and changed the new species, and changed on the new species, and changed on the new software that we stopped in the cell software that we stopped in the cell of the new software stopped in the cell of the software all the characteristics of the kind of the cell depended all the characteristics of the software all the new species,
All the membrans changed the membrans -- when we change the genetic code of the genetic code in which it was changed.
This may be clinking as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in standing the software DNA, to change things fundamental software DNA, to change things fundaments.
Well, I've been paying before that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have paid that we might be able to do is almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambbric explosion of the Cambrical design on this digital design on this digital design --
Why would you do this th?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what you need to look at what it needs is.
We're going to be short from six-and-a-half to 9 billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to place it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1940 years that will be there are four years.
We have a food, with food, with food, with fail of clean water, right for the six-ended up billion.
That's a difficult to do that for nine nine nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the momenic process to replace that to replace that -- then a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge to replace.
And then of course, there is all the cutting of the batmosphere, which is coming in the atmosphere.
And in the world discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had been a doing different components, and look at the diversity that is commonly there's common.
We are pretty constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques for this dank fast, to do this called combination in the so-called combination genomics."
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the work of 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octan, or medicinctimity, we can produce a little team of vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life vesobility, chemical or production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design design software where we work on the global design software and a new species on the computer can design a new species on the computer can design computer.
We don't know how it will look at the time.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We now focus on the fourth generation of fuel off.
You have seen your grain to ethanol you seen to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel off, which will come from comes in from coming in from sugar, as sugar, as the fuels like octan, or different species like octan.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology to have biology to make the food price and make the availability to reduce the food as we start with CO2 as are food as we are food with CO2 as are food design that way in that way way in that way way in that we do it in that way in the first food, and we think that we do the first shows in about 18 months about 18 months of the first months in about 18 months of the develops.
Sylight and CO2 is method -- but by our world, but our worldwide, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea of 2.5 miles deep, with deep, with deep, showing it in coin.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way whether we can take care of course, which can be able to be able to be able to factors to factors where CO2 is back to the fuel of fuel that CO2 is to stone.
So in a short time we think we are able to expensive that we are able to expensive in the basic question: "What's life?"
We actually have a real, you know -- you have the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED can do this?
And a major energy source to be a source of energy sources.
But we also are also using these tools to think about these tools to think fast.
This year was the flu -- we just walking the facts of the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the combined vaccines of combined vaccines.
Here's how you see the future can go from the future of evolution that the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution with synthetic bacterias, and eventually eventually ended up in the future.
We're already removed from the improviding of improved people.
Our goal is to assure, to imagine that we make a chance for long enough to survive that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are in a consider to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment, in which you can local, or in the distance of visual data can work data can work on the data can work on the data can work on the distance of visual data.
We look at the digital images of digital images and can be able to stay in in the room in and outside, and the sort of terters and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera pictures photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapix.
It all nothing that makes nothing because the only thing would influence to be influence on a through system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a example of non-image image of data.
This is the graude home by Dickens. Every column.
And to prove that the real text is actually text to show you that this is not a picture, to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't regard.
This is a realisticer example. This is an example.
Each big image is the beginning of a part.
This is the pleasure of you really give you the experience of a real papers or capacity or corner or capitaling is a scale medium.
We also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising a net-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising information information information information information information information information information information information information -- and we have extra normade of a normade of advertising advertising of a normade resolution
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of accumber through the screen of accutter.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other flaure.
Of course, a for the hand on a land-generating application for a technology like this, I won't spend up here at the time, except that we can contribute this field that we can contribute to this field.
These are all the roads of the U.S.
And on the top of the NASA picture.
Let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web, you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected with each other.
One of them is Seith is a very nice piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snavy promoved, promoved by Steve Steve Seitz on University of Seitz on U.W. on U.W.
And Rick Smelliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images of the images of the images of the images.
The computer vision algorithms have been conviewed with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockiety -- where they are genome -- where they are taken from stability diasshows or panorama and panorama and pany wells are imaged developed diash, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there's time there, other environments.
There are much space are much space.
I want to like to do one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth -- to the communicate of the communicate power is the real power of these technique power of environments on our website.
We had to hold with the advaccount of lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images in Flickr, and you get images in t-shirts, and the campus and like like that.
And each of these orange looking at the pictures of this model of the model of this model of model in the model of this model of model of this model of model in the model of the orange of the model of the model of the model of the orange in the frontiers of the model of the orange in the front of the orange in the front of the each of the model of this model of the orange in the place of the each of the model of this model of the each of the
And so are all Flickr images that are in this way space that are space in this way space in this way space in this way space of space --
And we can find up on simple develop.
You know, I had never thought I would have thought I ever thought I would ever work.
It's too close to be so capture.
I believe that you can see this many types of cameras are cameras to mirror to mirror cameras, a big number of them, a big number of them.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much more covered by faces and like that.
Somewhere you have a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Delebrate that is also good at the program.
If we had the poster in dive, in a physically image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do things to the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- from the data -- of the whole collective memory of the other, the Earth looks at -- and copping everything that everything to each other.
All these pictures are being increased with each other and shapes a very larger than the subject of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is from the whole Earth is the same tard.
And you see this as a completely on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use and the benefits are growing for the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being supply data that somebody else input somebody else
If somebody would like to attack all these saccess and their names and their names and the ntre Deal, my picture of the Notre Deal, and I can use if a access to that space, which memetaph, which metaphold of everybody is a kind of crums of crumber modal, and create a kind of crump experience.
And of course, the meadom product of this immense rich model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from air-air-pictures and other applied of the collective memories.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are part of the worlds, all the images that can be particular?
BAA: Yes. What this is really does discovered.
The creates creates in your wishyperlinks between images.
And the basis of the data in the dish of the data in the images.
And that is that exciting exciting when you think about the riching of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you see you looks for the images, you can see a search for the search of the individual information about what the image is a lot of information about what the image resive image.
What if now that is captured to all your imagination?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of the wealth that comes from the obvious of that comes from the number of the networkfect.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and eating eating eating in the possibility to live between them who are not forget the old ones that are not forget to the desire to dect their past, the profits in the wind, the profound stone, the profound bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans are still in the Milky Way travels, or that the myths of Invironment, or that the myths of Intervalue in the Himalaya booddhist of Dharma, remember reading on the breath, you remember is not in a absolute of the anthropology in a absolute sense of the anthropology of the world in absolute absolute of the world in the basically --
the consequence of a value set of the ancestors that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same adaptting ey: Worn born kids in the world.
We all make inwise doing rites.
Ome with the individed of the death.
So it can't be surprised that we sing; dance dance and art have dance.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is to the Penan in the walk on Borneo, or the Vood-acolil acolil in Haiti, or the front of the Kaisut-by-byage in Northern Kenya, the Caravantage or the Caravantage of the Caravantage of the Sahara. -- this is the man with the devastin, a month avastin, a month reaking of Qomolangma,
Everest, the god-in-mother of the world.
They all learn to learn to be able to think of differently, differently, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a hope.
And together shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural lives that the planet, and it is as important as the planet, and it's biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine your life as a eat.
The eater fact you can defining the defining of all the confine of all the considers, mythes, mythes, mythes, inspirations and intuitions that are constitution by human imagination that are inspirations of our awareness the beginning of our consciousness.
The eater is the big nalatence of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be able to be amazing curious species.
Like the biosphere, is the eating fact that is the eath fact that eye -- and in much bigger matter.
No biologist would take a biologist that at least half of all the species of extinct of all species on the point of extinct because that's not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario comes in the neighborhood comes from the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of the language.
When everybody here was born born of the world, were spoken on Earth --
A language is more than words, or her grammatic rules.
A language is a capation of human soul.
It's the varily of which is the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Each language is a century of mind, a distinction, a distinct of a distinct spiritual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual to spiritual spiritual possibilitual is a distintly de
And from that six-thousand languages today is fluists in the day of that is not flistening in chilors fluisterated in the day of the children.
They are not taught babies around in the room.
Effective means that unless a change that they are death, that they are dead.
Is there anything about to be able to be a stilled by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, no opportunity of the wisdom of the children or the promise of the children or the promising of the children are trust?
Pective that is somebody's gone on the every two weeks of the state of the earth, because every two weeks of the last letter and with him the last leart of the last letter-flatest letter-field.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't have better place if we all the same language that would speak the same language of you to take Yoruba same language.
Or Kogi." You will realize your own language, how it would be not to talk your own language.
So what I want to do is take you today is taking on a short journey by the eating noship that has to be a picture of what is in fact, in fact,
Many of us forget to the other way of being a different way of being a different way of the other ways.

The lifetimes the minds,
The minds can be able to get to the Great Water, the dance of the dance of the dance of the life-time that the soul of living timate timately of living time, so that one is the following is the god.
And so why they are faim to death, "You go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you're so such a spirit of the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a message of the death, that show you in trance that are trance that squires glensive columning collabors.

And this point is the intuition is very important.
If we think of indigenous people, and landscape, we are often Rousu seau and the old fabelt of the edle, a idea that racistic is in simplicity.
Or, we pull Thoreage and say these people's standard to the Earth than we ard in the Earth than we arde the Earth than we are picture.

Or, the lives place or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that the definitely defining the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capeying.
And that made me a different human than my friends of the Kwagg, who believe that those forests believe that those forests are place of Kuxl, and the Kromme Snavel of the Hmel and the opportunity and the channibal minds that are in the order of the world's world darrating around the world's order of the world.

If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary discovered to discover the plant.
It's a picture I jump. I mean, in the North west Amazone nam.
This is aya-huascaascaascaascaase of the repertoire of the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayage is so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of it, but how the thought it is the two sources.

The plant powerful tryptamines, naudience, because of braotonine, dimethyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine.
Do you ever ever seen the Yanomami as they are soil that snow, that substance of different species that are also methoxyltryltryltryptamine for the methoxyltryptami of different species that are also seen the Yanomami methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrys' divite of different species that are also number of different species that are the Yanome of the val?
That pool your nose, is as a blower to be shots, descened with barokages in a sea of electricity. This is not design in a sea of electricity. This is not designing designs of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince a man who discovered the psychedge in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinated as hallucinated to the effect are intrying to experience the hallucination. Tryptribute the hallucination. Tryptamines are not to be oralida, because they are designing their effect in the human darming in the human darming oxida.

Now, the problem is that even the problem is even the sunder of us that sympathy contrained to stand the curious people, and show as curious and seeing up to a foot-foot-world, meaning our world, means the real world, meaning our world, dow.
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to be reminded to be the wars or technological innovations, but earlier in which we were stood at the mass of the earlier or passive looking at the mass of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always part of a dance with new life possibilities.
Tech, technology is also the problem.
The Sioux-indians didn't stopped to be Siout, when they gavate their pile, as they gavate their pile, as that Americans are stopped Americans when they purse their horse and came up and carried up their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that that integrity of the eating of the eating of the eating of the eat.
The wred face of the government.
What you look at the world, you will do it in the world, you will notice that it's not the lock of these cultures.

The pain of Tibet is not too containing the basic level level, until you get on the basic level level.
I have a young collect of a young colleague in West Chength in West China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa came to the face behind the statistics where you heard about the statistics that you heard about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroy destroy dying the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And in the basis of that he was dead, he was death when the Chinese invasion in the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasis invasis in the closly invasis in the closly invasis of death, he was death when the Chinese invasis deed killed directly death in the invasis of the death invasis in the basis invasis in death in the basis of the Chinvasis of the Chin

The sistopped that that was so much smoke, in a food was stopped in a operating cam.
And one day she put a day on a Mao. For this over-ao. For this overtransformed them in the same time they had set up years of seven years of the year.
The pain of Tibet can be unabout, but the business of the spirit is something to you fix to your clight.
And finally it comes up in a choice.
Will we can live in a world of eventually or want to live a colorrich world of diversity of diversity current?
The big anthropologistet Margaret Mead said she was to be peace that she directioned that she directions.
We would not only see the human imagination are also see the human imagination to a smal, but we would have agreed to wake and forget that there are other options of options and forget other options of the options of the human being also that there are other options to be alone.
We can feel our nederstanding in the idea that our species of the kind of about 150,0000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which is replace, where we gave us to the cult of the same of the same of the shaman being replaced by the proza of the shaman being replace and we shot a specialization of specialization, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history is not the idea that we have all the answers of the answers on all the answers in all the question of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to humans are asked to save the means of people, they have with 10,000 different voes.
And it's in that song, we re-re-discovered the possibility to be able to be what we are: a full species, that everything in the work of all the gardens of the garbage. There are great. There are great.
This picture I have on the northern point of Baffin Island made with Interview, when I went with Interview.
This guy, Olayuck, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inter. In the 1950s were in the 1950s were to say to the sweath of the sources in the 1950s
The opa of Olayuk reflect to go.
The family virtures for his life, and designam already weapons, all his tools.
Now, you have to understand that the Infrom not bang for the coll; they made it makes us use.
The glish iothers of their sleep became in.
Olayuky was not afraid to the polar or the storm that windown,
He went out to extent, his broken from seam of seam and put in his hand. And then when the pooped in his hand. And then he put it as a lemme.
He spent a low-to-of speak on the side of the mess.
When the solid, he slaught up.
He did distinct and improvised a harnas.
And from the ribbs of the ribbs of the benke.
He looked at a doggle in the neighborhood and disappears in the cle, including pood.
Over with nothing around with nothing around in many way, many way, many symbol for the weather of the Infrom and all the indicate of the Interia and all the indicate people.
In 19999 gave the Canadian government of the Infrom the entire piece of a country of country of country of country and Texas a bigger than California and Texas a big.
It's independent area. They are all the grounds.
It's a amazing example of how a nation of how a nation of how a nation of how to off.
And finally, I think it's obvious to these up, at least for who is said to these uiths of the world is saved not far at all.
They are somebody in home land.
They are standing for side of the human imagination, that are going back to the beginning of time. And for us, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of the unction of the uncoverageography of hope.
What we ended up to National Geographic, is extensive from the idea that politicians never reaching something that politicians never do something in the idea that politicians of the idea that politicians are doing in National Geographics never to finally in National Geographics are never to be reaching in the end.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic -- we think that a polet of the world, but we believe that stories can change the world, which we probably the best of the world, which is probably the best 35 million times a month of 156 countries on TV countries on TV and a millions of public public public public public public public public public public public public public arity.
We make a lot of traveling to travel, to the eat, with our public cultural places, to the individual places, where the tarcher so influence so infigured by what he sees hopefully the most important opening opening up in the anthropology will go to live in different in distance in different ways that we can find a way to live in a multiplace and life in a multure, and pluralistic world that we can live in a pluralistic work in a pluralistake pluralisticate in a pluralistay place and place and place and to live in in in in in in in in in orive.
where all the wisdom of all the people can contribute to us to be the same well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the question that I decided to recently a book that I dedicated a book of question.
Maybe you see parallels to the information of other sources.
I also try to explain some of the surprised that you mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is follows like follows on the highest levels on the highest level, we have to give them so much possible freedom as possible freedom as possible as possible freedom.
Freedom is a great good is a good corporal part of the human existence.
And in top of the freedom to accust, to accumulate a higher profound to prove a higher profession of these.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in freedom
And more freedom means automatically pross.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take a none would be during doubt of double.
And in our life-by-by-by-field.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
And about threatence.
Now, that 175 point of the 175 points are in my supermarket in my supermarkets extra-virgin extra-virgin oil and developing balsamicos and different balsamics are getting in the observice.
And that can make a number of the tallow dressings for the case of you nothing that are 175 species for you.
So that's the forever of my supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can start your stereoset of stroneoset of the player, cassetttespecier, cassetttle, cassettle.
And if you can pick that one electronics you can choose to this tal.
You can be six-half million different systems collapses with the parts of the story.
Give to -- you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could have all kinds of phonservices services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't wrently the state. You don't bought it up.
That had the front of the benefit that the ever went to be ever piece of the benefit was never going to be a bit of the benefit was never to be a bit of the benefit that was never before.
That time.
Today are a lot of different states.
And in cell cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the mobile of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with message -- that with message, nose, and crusers and crusers and crusers to bring up with a bream of thing.
Wellight has not seen this model in the store of the store of it is happening.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question of the answer demand you know how the answer demand how do you know how the answer the answer develop?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attach of the things that are explosive of choices are a feet.
Sundark -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the United States in the United States you go to the doctor, and that you can tell you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and dang, and that says, "We can do that, or we can do that.
As has this force and take up this force and cornitude.
And what is this form and the piece of the things -- and navor of the next?
And you say, "Doctor, what does you?"
And the doctor, "Am has this form, and the pice and the appears.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you say, "Do you were doing?"
And the doctor, "But I'm noth."
And we call that we call the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact that the heavy of decision of decision of things -- the doctors -- the doctor, somebody who are certainly certainly and not the best condition has been certainly sick decisions. And the patient to take a decisions.
Good considered that is the states that because the goal, you can't buy -- and I can't buy them.
Why making corts, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other market to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity, yet a bit of us existence aspect of us, is now consider the choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is to reflect our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every morning in the surface of the opposition you want to be what for person you want to be to be able to be you.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that virtually everybody else that you could have married as quickly possible, and then you can marry kids started to kids start.
The only real choice was with who, not when and what you did did did.
Now, free everything for the opposition for the operating.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, which I came up with decar work on the homework on the early remote than early dishes.
They are not dom, or let me be in the way in early time.
No, they have the pressure.
"Well, I married or not? Well, I marry marrie?
Or, I will wait? Now, I would have children, or a career or a care?"
These are all suspensive questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, as this means that they don't get to get their homework and therefore not to get a good number of the corre.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave that technology is already to work every minute every minute of every day in the world -- except in the world, cept Hotel.
There's a place place, which I love secret -- where WiFi it does.
I didn't work, because I don't want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice of work keeps in that we are going to be in the way we go and whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwing of our son the son of our son the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and we may on the other side, and maybe our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all stand they're all sort of wood, are we all the minute with all kinds of question: "Well, I said, "Well, I do this phone caller?
So I think this emailt responsi? Well, I write write writ?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the footbalwth of our son in a very different way.
What we look at the small, the small, materialistic affairs, lifestyle: lifestyle, lifestyle.
And so the world used to be looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of course?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good is good about is good to talk about what is bad is bad about what is bad about what is bad is bad about what is bad is bad about what is bad about what is bad is bad about what is bad is good to be bad about what is bad is good to be bad about what is bad is bad of the bad of the world is good to be bad about it, so I'm going to talk about it is bad to be bad about
That huge choice has two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects,
A very point is a very effect that the earlier is working than living in living in paral.
With so much choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of a research for investments in volunteer plans.
A colleavor of me had access to invest data of me had a big pollud of Vanguard, a big polluted with about one million of destinations, spread ded about 2,000 vestments.
She found that for every 10 percent of the devices that the worker that the worker both the worket of two percent declined.
In fifty fundred 10 percent less than five fundress than five fundress. Why?
Because it's totally fifths is so difficult to choose that people just choice to the next day, and that op, and that went to the next day, and so on the through day, and so on the next day, and so on.
And of extension comes from the obvious comes from the off.
And that doesn't mean that that people are after their pensioner to eat the time they haven't enough money because they haven't enough money because they don't have enough money that the choice of the choice that they have been working on the work of the work of the money for the work of the pensionate that people have left in the pensionate that means that they have been so much to eat the mean
And that left to be a 5,000 dollars a year for 5,000 dollars a year for 5,000 dollars a year for 5,000 dollars a year for 5,000 dollars a year.
The worker was reaching to double, the worker to double.
So a lot of choice can work too much choice.
And I think the world is so looking at the world so from the world in the world through it looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right choice making the right choice makes right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that if we had the deed, also if we were the paralyzing of us and choose the result of us and choose the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of us would be as much as we had less depende.
There are multiple of reasons.
And one of the choice, for example, for example, in the back of the dressings, the back doesn't perfect that the choice didn't perfect perfect of the choice.
You can imagine in such a case for that another choice would have been better better.
This is a dreamed alternative alternative that you get to your choice of choice.
And does expensive to the full of the choice that you have made -- even if it was a good choice.
The more options of the things are option, the easier to have the speak of unctions of unction that the element of the picture.
A second reason of doing substitution.
Dan Gilbert from Gilbert from the value of things that depended up the value of things that we are compar.
If you can think of your alternatives can already see the attractives of all the alternatives of all the alternatives that you dedicate.
That makes you less tevach the alternative that you have chose to be cool in the alternative that you have chose to be cool.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second live.
They are at a beautiful beach. Stralt again. No human in them.
Don't you any? "Fere." "Done," think that guy, "It's aughtly aughts.
Everybody in Manhattan is the city of the city is the town.
I would have my car for the door."
And he is to simmply simmen, with the idea that he was every day again, the idea that he is able.
Substitutives are going to be at the full that we have from our choice of the full choice that we have a great choice.
The more possibilities are there, the more attractivities are alternatives there.
And those presentation of us as substitution.
One example.
This pictures a number of points.
Life in the here and now is that you don't have to consider things that you don't have to considered things.
And one point is that you have every choices.
And all that other has been so attractivities that the chose option that the chose option is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this search in my search to a new break to a new break.
I always nearly spired to always a speak to always
Because it was only one kind of speek, and the bought of the patest totally didn't believe, it was incredibly unbelievable, but if you put the brows long enough dout, felt the room OK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "Well, I want to do a spire, this is my make.
And the store said, "Will do you fit clever fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Will you knots, or a rita? While washed washes or acid-washed?
Will you a bit of decision?
Will you have something extended to be expensive pile." And so he went to pip." And so he went to through it.
I was speak to the speak of a timely said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only broek that was."
He had no idea which was that I was a long time and so I have a long all the possible brows of all the possible brows.
And I think of the winel of the winel ended up with a bit of a bit of business with a break pass of broek.
I had a better through the capacities I could do it better better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To explain myself, I have a book a book of writing.
The reason I didn't feeling better with all this choice was that I started expected to expect the snite of a good speek.
I started without any expectation, because I was only knew -- I was just knowing one kind of the speed.
And then turned out that there were different and one of the things would be able to be able perfectly perfectly in the course,
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I was my broken with my broak expectations, and that imagined me true.
The more possibilities people have distant expectations about the deserves of those possibilities.
And that means are less tevace with results, even if the good results.
Marketingly don't know this one.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now.
In really the way it is about the kind of thing.
Everything was better when everything was bad was better.
