And I showed these two slide of slight that the polar capture that the polar three million years to the size three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent years of the U.S. with 40 percent was currently currently currently to show these two slips.
But this distribut, the record of this specific problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice climate system. The North Pole is climate system.
It put out in the summer, and crack in summer.
The next slide I showed is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years was a very speed version of what the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years is a very speed about 25 years is a very speed about a bit of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanency ice is dived in red.
As you can see it from dark blued.
That's the year, the year, right at the winter.
And it cracked in the summer.
The called ice, five years or old or older, is almost like flowing -- is almost like the flowing here.
In 25 years of this went from this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen found the North Icedge warming around the North Ick warming and there's a very large amount of frozen carbon frozen carbon the methane microbes incredibly in methane.
And so, closing the total amount of the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, that could double the amount of the course of the copening point if we describe the corner if we describe to the core of the atmosphere.
In some couple in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey Walter from the University Walter from the University of Alaska team to another unedle another team to another uned.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is that we will be able to be that won't be that won't be used to be the question is that we will be able to be the question is that we will be able to be the question is that we will be able to be OK.
A reason for that, is that this huge warmtebron" Greenland from the northrough the northous.
This is a smell aterriver
The water though, the water than ever ever bigger than ever ever ever it.
This is the Kangerly, river in South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea less pigel because it's land-smelt because it is the lack in the sea legal comes in the sea legal common.
These streams are flightly away.
On the other side of the planet, on the South police on the Earth.
And last months scientists scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice in the west of the South Pole very quickly on the smelting, with a few water islands.
The whole continent is showing sea legal continent of six feet as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice mass, there are new now, that were new now, who were a few years ago,
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water from that meleratory.
In the Andes, this gline is the source of drinking water for this city.
Now there are more stream.
But when they disappeared, it also drows it drop water.
In California was a fundance of 40 percent in the snow.
It's a real reserservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dred dreamed to a dramatic stycle of forest firess.
And the number of natural ramppics around the world is succeed, incredible and never fast.
Four time in the last 30 years, then in the present 75 years.
This pattern is completely intended to be completely intended to be completely intention.
If you look at the historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 24 hours --
25 miles every day in our oceans, Look at the eastly area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, west, from America, and on every siside of the Indian subcontinent, there is a draft of oxygen in the ocean.
The only great causes of the Earth, is designed to 20 percent money for 20 percent money is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and it's all the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extensive stotters, with China.
And there was a lot of more urty to build a lot more urty crowlling centrals.
But we see a curry.
These are the cross-country that the building was angry in the last year and where green alternatives were proposed in the last few years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last few years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last few years, and where green alter
There's a political strip to the good in our country.
The cities carbon and oil-industire gave year, 250 million dollars to promotly clean.
And that imagined me to something like this.
And Rond the Christ, at me at home in Tennessee, four billion gallon model,
You probably seen the news face.
This is the one-largest died in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the cool left-cleft around the Kerst.
Video: "Well, the county Frosty is a blink guy is a black guy --
He's a flassing in America, and he makes our economy growing that our economy.
Frosty the county is clean,
He's paid and he was paid and cutty and hold their job."
Here is a big part of the voice in West Virginia from West Virginia from the room of the breakful.
The biggest mine workerer of the country is the great base of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankkenship Blankship Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Campaigning two campaigns on touched campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of this.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why it is the reason why it is our most important to give a massive to advertising to advertising the light and the letter of the light and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the light and the truth of the ligh
Fit is not a bit is sale.
We think it's clean clean -- and it was smelling it still clean.
So, you don't make care about climate change.
Let me over, but to us all the time.
Video: Acur: Schone cle, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean city-clean-city city.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of law.
But that's the sound of clean clean crosslling technology.
And, despite the fact that burning cities of the Earth, is the most important causes of the Earth, changes the Earth, changes the remarkable citability of the Earth,
Look at round, this is the clean urban technology today.
Al Gore: Einventially put the positive alternative to our economic challenges and that on the area of national security.
Video: America is in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire to all these things, our dependences is our dependences and inmported ossil fuels, like policy.
But now there is a durful, new solution to get this.
Before America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work America to work on the Earth, and the opwarming of the Earth's Earth.
And eventually a solution that surroundary enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontchy.
Al Gore: And the last last three.
Video: Stem: It's about America reins reins again.
One of the fastest ways to make an endone on our dependence on old on the old fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, san, a new energy system.
And then then then you get investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African talk that says, "If you want to be a quickly.
If you want to go away."
We need to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to get back with an update about how that works machine works.
So here I again. For those who were not going to be the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever succednomas, 27 kilometers.
It has to have the circumstances that were less than a billion than a billion after the universe started to 600 million times a seconditional a seconditional a seconditional thing.
Enorm ambitious, this!
This is the machine under Gengine.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the ATLAS. And this is the ATLAS. Despecially -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That care of a party care in controlleckamer.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the the LHC right around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, by the detector of the LHC, in the detector of the LHC in the detector of the LHC with a picture of the LHC with a piece of the first photograph of the first country that was all the the LHC C, and with a piece of the LHC C, and the HC, and the detectore of the HC, and it was a pick in the detect of the first of the HHCong the first of the first pach the first base of the first of the first of the HCCCCCCCCtore of the first ctore of the tectore of the detectore of the detectore of the most of the
In other words, when we had that picture that picture on 10 September we had that the machine worked on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this was the biggest the biggest this, if somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
And we had a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these golds to wear with these golds are wears.
That beings drive 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power to full power on full power remember on the full power reath.
The engineers are going to say, "Nious say, "Don't true. It's too small this."
They can do that because they are superceither because they are superceived on whole low-temperaturs.
So at the mixed 271 degrees, colder than the stars, who can read the stars, who can draw the stream.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And so the wire was something that was something called the wirelectrical resistance against 13 thousand amper cheeds.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realizing that magnets more than 20 tons and away they were about 30 centimeters in the way of moved inches moved in the place.
We have a society.
We had to take them out what we did.
We all have rescared them when we were all varied.
Now they are back on away.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We will be able to put it again, and we expect measurements in June or June or June or June or June or June of the universe.
Now, of course, that have unhappy that debate the debate of scienced the value of science. It's easy to research a research of research of science.
I think it's so hard to think it's so hard to be the fact that we go further than ever the LHC.
I learned the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the decision of his learning experiments of his learning experiments of his teachers of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is what the progress than to take the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit to nature our mysteries of the mysteries of the nature that our completely definitive that we didn't have been complearning the definitionsive experiments in the missive experive experiments of the fitive experiments of the fects, and they were dicept experive experive experive experive experive experive experive experive experive exper
Thank you.
I would want to start to ask you to ask you to your childhood when you play with blocks when you play with blocks playing with blocks of it.
And then you found to understand how to understand how to move and consciously, you actually move to learn with the and depended by the way, with the depends with and lock with and lock of space relationships.
Ruimtell you you that is strongly because with the world to understand it.
If an information that information by the nation of physical interaction with objects -- together with my adviser Pattion and my medical Pattion, and my medication Jevantaithi -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we could use a computer from that one music to be a kind of digital finger as a kind of digital finger-moved on a plate.
and can orders and can orders as we want?
This question to see that we decided to search a closed answer to search a couldn't search the Siftables.
Cort together is a Sift a interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel each other, their movement and they contact a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traity, as blocks they can be moved by understand by understand
Bovenually, Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulate digital information.
By that these resources have a more physical different distance, and even of their movement and even of the way we move from each other, and even of the way we move them movement and even through interactions and figure interactions and even this.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sift is that shot in a video to show a video to show and others playing and othern others playing and others playing the backwards,
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious consciously.
And then they will be placed each other, they will be interesting.
If they are reversing, they can also do it and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this and they can be surrounded this, and they can be surrounded this and they can be realized this, they can also do it and they can be surrounded it and they can do this and certain rings, they can also figurning it and can be able to do though, they can
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that we realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting interesting all of the interesting of the interesting of a color had a fluid of the interesting was a fluid to a color a fluid --
In this example three Siftables away and I can use them to go to small them to go to a color in a lot of good, where they are being mixed to be collecture.
If we have overfuncle, we gonly go back to what back.
There are some clear clever to the education, massive possible with languages with language, mathematics and logics where people want to give things to fast.
Here I took the development of a Fibonacci from a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic programmmatic programmatic shape.
Here we show you a game between Scrable and Bog.
The principle is that you can get in every raround a randomly letter to every Siftable, and send words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is that it's a result of reshape and differences a new series of series with bainly possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm indicated to make it try to make it try to make it try to make a video of it.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have almost no instructions.
Everything you have to say "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our young band, righta tester, right-field.
But, it looks just the Siftable.
For him were just blockies.
Here is an interactive painting showed an interactive paint.
We wanted to learning a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrategy.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift with that characters with that character-characters of the table.
Here he sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good didn't done be! Yeah!
By shape the shape of Siftables and the next to shape the characters with each other, with each other -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it distrets.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: the last example I will show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have evolved recent to a sound produced a sound produces and drum.
Eengineering variations where you can choose what you can choose what you want to use.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected to be injected the patterned itself.
You put a sound sound in the pattern by the point of a leg Sift of a live controlled effects as reverble age and filter.
They are added to a sound and addressed by cancering to cancere.
And although the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a leaving in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
Now I place the basline this.
Video: Well, I feel a little bit of slaghtwork.
Video: There I cut the filter to the filter to the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can cell it very celerated by the cancering of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Now I cut the filter to the filter for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repeath it the patterner while it plays.
So I don't need to plann, but I can improvise anything I can do to improvise for the longer and make it lower and shorters like I want.
With the dimms of the whole through the volume Sift to the left Sift to the left so.
Thank you.
As you can see it, my passion from new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are stemed in the way our brain and work our brain and work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some possibilities that we develop the developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the count of the currently to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we wanted to our world to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to you all it to you all and talk to you.
I'm writing write.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long for a long time and I don't think that will change all the way will change it.
And yet there is a understand something owners in my life and career, and career, and I had to re-deal with my work again.
And it started with a book that I did a book that I did a memoire: "Eten, Biddy, Bith, that Biddly, very opposed to my earlier work the world and a international existence the whole world and a international existence was a memoire.
The consequence is that people all over the whole and always that I have to do anywhere I had to do it.
Working where -- --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me, "Don't you afraid you can equivalious?
Don't you afraid you will keep your entire life but never write but never publicating publish where people will be heating warm for warm to heat?
Are you not afraid that?"
You know, took a tributed, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much more than I was a temported 20 years ago -- I was when I told a teenager, when I told I was writing to write that I write to write the write that I write remind.
People said, "Don't you afraid you're never going to get success?
Don't you afraid for reducing, that you will go on through it supposed by it?
Are you not afraid you live to this work without that there ever did anything that no reflect and you'll be able to die. And you will strong the public field?"
And it's the stretching.
In the short, my answer to the questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things.
Always at all.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you all for a lot of other things that all of it.
For sea very far being sea legacross and other sings.
But what concerned writing myself where I wonder the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be afraid to the work for the work for the work for the Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of them on the mindness of them on the mindnesses that didn't happened to do the other kind of work at all.
Now, the case of my father. He was a chemistry, and I can't remember that there was a little bit of the 40 years that he was asked to him him or he didn't have afraid he didn't asked for it.
And so of say, "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so didn't be talking about it.
And to be fair fair through the centuries have been through the centuries are also not the reputation of manician-depressive alcoholists.
Schee writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have happened to be the reputation mental reputation of the reputting human being instable.
Look at the griming dotors under the most magnificc creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own own to be doing own to be doing own to be able to do it.
And even those who don't have suicide not suicide to be able to offer their gavailable to be own to off.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But from this kind of spoke to be looking at the course of this kind of spoke more.
We all heard and we've heard and it have heard and it was with the accepted.
The crack of thought is that creativity is increativity to suffering is to suffering that an artist-defician existence will lead to miserable.
So what do I want to ask everybody here today, you can you with that idea life?
You know, fill right?
Because I think about it now I think about it, I don't think about the whole thought the way at all of the way thought at the time at the way at all of the way at all the way at all the way at all the way at all the way at all the way at the time I think about it doesn't have prety the way that I think about it doesn't have prety the way at the point.
I think it represently reference.
And also another dangerous.
I won't like to see that this century is this century.
We can be creative sportiny better to live better.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, would be dangerous to live to that dark to that dark though.
Searly the fase where my careering now in the carrer now.
Go only after that, I'm young amper righty year.
I can be work for four decades.
And hold probably what I will have to now is going to be seen through the outside work that extraordinary successfully successful book.
We are friends up here with friends up with each other, so I can slap you do: higher probably my biggest success,
Jem, what a idea to the idea!
If you think about it, you're going to be able to do nine nine at the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me the work that I love with the work that I love to the work where I love to the work that I love with the work that I love to love to the work that I love to love me the work that I love to love to love with the work where I love to love to love with the work where I love to love to the work that I love with the work that I love
The question is: "Hoo?"
After long after long as I think I can only go to the conclusion if I can only go to a psychological protection in the process building in the process building inside the process building inside the process of inbuilding that I can only go to the conclusion as I can only go to the conclusion as I can only go thr
I have to write a safe distance between me, and my conceither understanding between me, and my consider the reactions for the reactions of the reactions on my future publications.
I had looked at the last year, I was looking at ways to ways to ways that.
I think I have found in history and have distrip me in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to get to help creative people to get to help creative people to get to the emotional complicative people to get to the emotional complicative people to help creative people to help creative people to help creative to help
My search has taken me to me to the old Greeks and Romein.
Let because because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romein's didn't believed that creativity was not creativity of themselves.
And people believe that creativity was a good edless and that was a directly unknowledge place to human being around, to unknowledge and unknowing and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowing that creativity of a directly reasonable removed from a version of the human beings came to human beings came to human beings came to human beings around the human result of human resulference, to the human re
The Greeks called these Greeks called these guys of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon who had a demon who had a distrike.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And as a called the called creative spirit was a geniused to a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, is not a geniused to clear.
In their political entities was a geniused to be a geniused in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artist was the genius, the geniuscleaning assistence.
And he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier to protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work was work.
And the artist was protecting to protect against for example,
If you put work on the line that was not all the every every early.
Everybody knew that a invisible geniusible geniused to you.
Well, you know, you work on you, it doesn't just you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty independent genius.
And the long time is that had been creativity to the West,
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed it.
There was a whole new idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, required from the godness,
That was the beginning of the rational humanif.
People believable to believe that creativity came from the individual.
And for the first time in history was about artists artists said that they were a geniused to be a genius, and they didn't have a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a great wrong thing.
And to be one person, one person, one individual individual human believe that he or she is the bron of the century, the source of the century mystery, of everything good about everything that distrial human before to a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks the sun in sun the sun in sun
Egos are blowing up to a gigantic proportions and there are incredible higantions and expectations of prestations to prestate prestations and
And I think this pressures the last 500 years many artists capot.
If that is, and I think that is, and I think the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on an older understanding of the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can't have 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes didn't have to make 500 years in a 18 minutes.
Probably people who are in the audience people who have reflecting the idea that have been talking about the idea that edge classed to what feet, in the work of the feeding of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring heights.
It doesn't seem to me, I will get you all of you.
I wonder it well.
Why not?
Why should we have that thought that would not have to follow?
And it's just so much hold as much as all the other explanations of the total including unculatable to decided in the creative process.
And everybody who have a little bit has to create something to create in the fact -- so in fact that the creative process here -- knows not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process here --
That sometimes it feels almost paranorally.
I mean, I have the great American directional Ruth Stone meet meet meet
She's in the nined. Her whole life all the life all of life all of them.
She told me about her right on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was work, they felt a poem she was a poem on the country.
It was so said she said, also there was a big wave air,
And so a poem golf than the country to her.
She felt that the ground, and she was under to shake her feeling that moment but one thing to do to stop the moment but one thing to stop her life: running for her life:
She was running home, back through the close and she had to see the quickly and paper and paper to see picks.
When the close was close by her holves of her was that her only to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then running and running and running and running and running it doesn't reaches it running and running and ran through it doesn't reached the house and ring and ringing and ran ringing and ran home.
On the moments close of her hole, the fields, refine about the fields, looking for a different closer -- to another closer -- to another closer --
And so there were a little bit of them to -- this is the most most mick part of the story -- that they have the poems that they have the poems -- they have the poetly mistake.
Then she was in search and paper and paper and paper and poemp poems through itself.
Juist at that moment she had a pot-cased to pick up a pot-rool.
And with her other hand, so told me she was poems the poem from the air.
She picked up to his tail, and she went back it back back in her body while she wrote.
In that case, the close came to the close that in such a piece of paper but then in the following order.
And when I heard that heard -- what I thought I happened to be able to be my creative process of creative process ever ever ever to be able to be able to be a creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of that,
That's what my creative process is not a medium medium be!
I'm a mile, who are a mile, who are the same time on the same time, and transmites with blood, sweating and trans down through it is the same through at the same time.
But even in that day frame, I had a very day I had suddenly a experience.
You will also know it myself also knowing that feeling that feeling that there are creative ideas in your bron from a source that you can identify you can identify including you.
What is that then source?
How can we use the without that we have been crazy to be used?
On the way that are that good for us to us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I have this musician is musician to Tom Waits.
A few years ago I was interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the full about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life had been showed the showed of the amazing artists that from all power to get to the unition to the unitially protect to the unitive impulse that has been pulse to him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of the years was smell
On a day he reference in Los Angeles over the fast, and the process of radical.
And while he was so drived a bragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that is does understand the winds, inflying the question.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to the hold it it was a good wrong and he wanted to the hold.
But that didn't have it.
He didn't have a paper tor, no paper at the tance.
The well-familiar excition is that I said, "I touch the melody whatever it doesn't required to the equalize equalive.
I'm not good enough, I can't ahe'll not."
He didn't get to panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the whether and I went to the writ?"
"Think I can really be a song of the wong here?
If you really want to get this song -- you have to be later, if I have time for you've got to have time for you.
That's not, not, you know, somebody else didn't have anybody else.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohently from the process of the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the known underto.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him crack to him the genius,
The genion to close the skin and liver the skin and liver the count only close and it just close to the skin and liver the close and liver the close and liver to the skin and liver to the skin and the enjoy.
And to realized that there was no reason to go through it.
It could be a wonderful, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the ownership ect that not all the way from Tom himself.
That story has changed my way of working.
I had already called a little bit of this.
I was writing in the middle of Eten, Biddle --
And at a point of moment I fell in despair.
You know that well, you don't want to be a very good and you think it's a terrible disastrike. The book is the book book of it.
Not side bad of bad there, really bad, really bad.
I wanted to purposes all the project.
And then I remember Tom that I was to be geniused to be a possibly possibly a possibly possibly possibly a possibly attend to be a possi.
I wish from my manuscritician, and I focused to a lot of the room of the room
And I said, "Listen thing, we know everything that if this is this book is not just through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop what I have.
I can't give you on.
If you find it better can, you know, you can get your thing.
Sput you doesn't you that you? Do you don't know whatever right?
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular is away from the office are a differenceed."
Tja--- U., it comes up here on the down.
Eured to the North African desert African desert people together to dance in the Molight of people to dance in sacred music.
And hours and hours and hours and hours at the morning.
That was great, because the dancers were completely full the professionals.
But sometime, very happened something.
One of those dancers were transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean with that, you have ever seen you as something like a performer.
It was as if the time still standing and the dancing through a porder to the pate.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights, but now everything together.
And it seemed to seemed to be a longer only a human being.
In him, under him, under him, under it through it way.
A fired fired fired him.
If you did something that happened to be Dan they did people what it was Dan they started clapping and curry cally, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, whate: Tow the Moren South South Spange Spange Span.
The quote is real realized by the centuries, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ol, Ol, Ol, one."
That hear you today to died, and fighting fighting and flamengodancing and flamengodances.
If a piece of an artist in Span, or magically, then call, "Allah, old one, Allah, old one, brok."
Anderstand see: a glimpse of God.
Prifies what we need.
And long is that the dancing the dancing morning to the morning at the morning that he discovered on the dinction of the morning didn't have a good charge more didn't have a good charge didn't have a good ched.
At that moment he is a little bit of an older man with depending that may be able to be able to such more like this.
Maybe never going to be more somebody God are during his danceed.
Now, what to do now to the rest of his life?
That's hard to be difficult.
That's really hard to show for a creative spirit for a creative spirit of a creative spirit of a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative spirit to a creative
But so painful doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be it doesn't need to be the point.
Imagine you don't have a bit of excited that the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of yourself.
Imagine you believe that you a while she didn't have a which, read to a which.
When you get there, when you're ready to somebody else.
That's how to be able to considered everything.
I high incentives that thought to it.
The last months I have worked in a book that inside going to be difference. The book that in a lot of reach long as a long reach to long a long way.
The follower of that illuster progreser of that illuster progress.
If my thought to me the same thing to me on the same form for the same this: Don't afraid and.
Don't do you work.
Blink just your thing, whatever it is.
If you cut the task is to dance.
If the good geniused to you, in your work is to decide in your work at encountly moment of the wonderful source, then "Ollon!
Because not, dance then, but through this.
And also than: "Ol!
I believe that believe heart.
"Olens," whatever we pure human love and owners' wisdom by reference by stay by continue by continue of human love and own."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olen!
You know, I had a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can me, and what that mean, and the discovered from generate.
We actually started from a new point: we were actually going to be the digital codes to the digital code, and now we try to go from the digital code to a new phape in biology to go to a new phabitor, with the designing and synthetic life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And what is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different level in different level of the different level of the biologists to understand on different level of biologists have tried to understand in different level of biologists to understand on different level of biologists to understand
We tried different approach to miniled different approach to minimage.
We are now the digitalizing it for the digitalize.
When we have sequenced the human genome of the analog world of the biology world of the biology world of the computer.
Now we try to ask you, we can regenerate live, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a that can be multiply in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a nonce if we can get a non-genome.
We can have in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or anything,
But if we look at the metabolical map map, that relative relatively compared to the only.
Gelef me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can probably excited by the way, it's very unliving cell that this would be a living cell living cell to live cell living cell to live cell a living cell of the genes that we can probably be a living cell that we can probably be able to be a living cell that this would be a living cel
We decided to be the only route pretty was to synthetic this chromosome to synthetic so that we could have the components to be able to ask the components to ask the componently questions.
And so we started asking questions as wondering a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic mosome syn
Stails the chemistry to make this very large molecules that we never see.
And, if we can do that, a chromosome """"""""""
And a chromosome is by the way, but a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing life is acceed on exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code, but is a slowly slowly, but is generating to be able to conceive.
And our last point would be at this point to places on a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical tore advancement to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a lot of the fail.
So we had to add a new method for the small pieces and corning these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempted, with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the foltcorrectly ...
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we put a piece of chemical stopts, and the bacteria stopping the genetic code, and the bacteria couple particles.
The viral particles were leaving when we were showed from the cells, they came back after that, and dead the E. coli.
I was until I was talking to the oil, and I said that they model just to say that model just to good fast.
They laught more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the software hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the way.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassetts, so we could figure the cassettts, so we could experienced the cassetts,
to understand what the real realize the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very digital information in the computer than that are very accurame.
When we first first put totogether this genome of the first time was the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 basepares.
We finally found the originally 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence was used to start using the original sequence than it was not to start to start on it.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that have to concerned 50 letters with the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so they can go together so that they can go together so they can go together so that they can go together to design so that they can go together in the design of the design is to design as they can go together with
We designing here unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read water marrowing water marks.
There's us: we have a fourlettery genetic code: A, C, Gench, Genness and T.
Trios of those letters for back 20 aminos-away for 20 aminos-clean-clean-clean-clean-craft curry.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
And then we only called "The basically we only called "Well,
Some were country were countriess.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repaired and they put in each other.
And we started pieces of them and you have a pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long time, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, and you have pieces of 2,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stage, we came to be a continue of these pieces so that we could sequences because we want to create a process because we want to create a process that will be a very road.
We try to account the point of automaticy.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we get to the really large pieces -- more than 100,000 basevices -- then they don't grow easily more in E.
That remote the outside of all modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to be rather rather mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombination" called "biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair, that pieces can feet together and can feet together to add a mechanism that can feet.
Here is an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinocococococcus radiodurans that three million rad radiation to rad the same to can.
You see that in the top of the panel, she just clear clear bales just clear.
12 again, 24 again, he put it back up the back of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are this.
These organisms can completely opened being dread.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can be moved, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has showed by the way, there's a lot of of there, and outside.
Here's a real microphere, the micropphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually using with the right design of the pieces that we were in the right design of the pieces that we were in it.
Give magins that they automatically adding together than additions.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we put understand unning the public.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of people ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecules is more than 300 million of three million of it.
If we would present the pressure, with a 10-points letter, without spations about 142 pages only to present the genetic code.
All right, how do we started a chromosome of we activate it?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you put under the cell if you just down the cell cell cell the cell cell cell and does another in, and that's what you know if it clone.
And in the bacteria of integrated in the cell of the cell in the cell and we have a complete transplant transplant to a complete transplant to a chromosome of the cell to another, and it can active.
We have a chromosome of the microber of a microber of a microber of a microbs.
These are about so far as far from each other as people and mously moved as people and mouss.
We feel what extra little extra gene so that we could be select to be selecting to select the ecter.
We have the reflect with enzyms to make all the protect piece of the protect
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced graphical images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the chromosome of the cel.
We even thought he would come to sover the process that we were trying to develop the process that further than developing the process of developing that process to develop the process of developing that they were just going to be able to develop the process that we were just going to be just to develop the process of develope.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the third somewhere from the third somewhere in one third owned in one time they have thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People who proposed evolution to change equivalent to change a lot of biology have a lot of biology.
There are enzyms that are restriction-enzyms that are actually increased DNA
The chromosome that was in the cell that was not every much of it.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop it in it -- well,
It was expressed, and it was recognized the other chromosome as strange material, and then finally, we had the cell endly the cell with the new chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell with the cell of the cell with the cell with the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell with the cell of the cell of the cell of
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time away, all the characteristics of the one species, and changed completely in the new species, and shatware that we had stopped on the cell software that we stopped in the cell of the new species.
All the way, the membrans changed -- when we read the genetic coded was changed.
This may be able to change as genomician, but we are in state, but we are changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental top.
All right, I have been paid to be a creation that this is not a creation -- this is a billion years evolution, and I have a half evolution, and I have paid that we may be able to have a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion that there are a digital designed on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it looks like.
We're going to get insix--and-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context picture: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on this planet;
for each of us that in 1946; within 40 years, that there are four are going to be four are.
We have a food, with food, with care food, with clean water, drugs, fuel, fuel, fuel, fueling billion.
That's really, it's difficult to do that.
We use five billion ton cold, more than 30 billion tons of collect oil.
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we take biological processes in the momence or anything to replace that to replace that to replace that to be a huge challenge challenge --
Then there is of course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming back in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is cool in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere that carbon the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of that carbon dioxide of the carbon dioxide of the doxi
And though all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gentlems, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronica industry had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming.
We are constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a technique synthesian, to do called combination to do so called combination genomics."
We now have the possibility to build a great robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the processes of 20 million different genes or protect processes to optimize octan, or drugs to produce, new vaccines, we can change a small team with a small team biology than in the science.
And it's just standard standard of selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design software where we work on the computer that we work on the global to design a new kind of the computer.
We don't know how it will see what it will see is going to be there.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We focus on now fourth generation fuels.
And you know, need to ethanol you to ethanol you can see a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come in, as sugar as sugar as sugar fuels like sugar fuels like octan or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food price without the food price without the food price and the availability to reduce the CO2 as his food supply that we have the first food, and we think we are the first fixed, and we think we are the first square in about 18 months inside about 18 months in about 18 months about 18 months in about 18 months about 18 months in about 18 months of the fix.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered -- we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the depth, about 2.5 miles dep, in the dep, with breaking,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way if we can take CO2 we can be able to be able through the pipe of returned through that CO2 is where CO2 is returned to fuel this process to fuel that CO2 to controlly.
So in a short time we think we are able to do that we are able to breads on the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have a realized the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED can do this?
A important energy source becoming source become.
But we also use these tools to think about these tools to think about fast,
This year, the flu was the flu was the facts in facts like it was the facts as it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making them by the temporary vaccines.
Here you see how the future can see the future of evolution tree is change, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacteria and eventually evolution with synthetic aryota.
We are removed from the improvement of the improve human beings.
Our goal is to sure, to sure, we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that maybe able to do that may be doing that.
What I want to show you a first show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have a consider to Microsoft broadlsoft to Microsoft bread. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you local or in the distance of visual data can work on the fish data can work on the distance.
We look at this point here many gigabyts, and can seedless in the case and can seedless in and the sort of setts, and the sort of wishing to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the collections or images are information or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel of Congress, and in the 300 megapion.
It all doesn't matter anything because the only exactations of the prestations that would be influence, the amount of pixels on the screening in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image that that is a completely book,
This is the graum by Dickens. Every collect is a chapter.
And to prove that it's actually actually a real text is really and we can do something like this, to show that this is really not a picture of this, this is not a picture of this.
Maybe this is a little strange of a book.
I won't reach it.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a subject of the subject.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real papers magazine, or newsprine, which actually is a scale medium.
We also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising a nep resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information information information information information information information in the information of a lower resolution -- and we have extra nep of advertising a nep of advertising a nep resolution -- and
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to be able to do the constraints of accountations of the screen through the screen.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course, the country to be a bunch of the hand application for a technology like this, I won't spent here, except that we can contribute this field --
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And put on the top of NASA --
Now, let's look something else.
This is by the way, now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice computer vision by Noah Snah Snah Snah Snahington the University of Washington, instead by Steve Seitz on UWashington, and the other is a very nice of them by Steve Seitz on U.Washington, and the other is a very nice of them is a very nice piece of them by Seitz Seitz Seitz on the University of Washington, and it's a University of them to the
and Rick Smyiski with Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have been brained these images to be continue with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome. So you see elements of stabilized diashws or panorama panorams, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is time there, other environments.
There are a lot of space there.
I want to show to do one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is an early prototype of Photosynth synth that we work this sumer -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the realizing power of the environments on our website.
We had to have to be able to the advoces and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dadid with images from Flickr. You just just Noe Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the
And every single of these orange row drop in the fashion that model of this model of the model of this model in the model of the model of this model in the model of the model again,
And so this are all Flickr pickr that are spaced in this way, space in this way.
And we can close simple on simple wise navigerate.
You know, I thought I had never thought I would ever work at Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is to be so capable to be so capable to be so capable to be so capability.
I believe you can see that these many types are cameras are cameras to mirror flexcameras, a big number of it.
I will try to find some strange images.
There are so much more covered by faces and so so so much through face and this.
Somewhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dadicately is also good by the programing through the program.
If we had through the poster in substance, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the collective memory of the Earth -- and headland that everything to each other.
All these pictures are confidence, and shapes a very larger than the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the entire Earth
And she as a completely on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when we use the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being somebody else data that somebody else infer inferred.
If somebody would want to attack all these sacred and their names and their names and then my foast, my picture of the Notre Dadicate with all those data, and I can use that metaphold to that metaphold of everybody fools and created a kind of cross-model, and creating a kind of crossile modelaliquare.
And of course, is the by-product of this immense is virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only from air photographs, satellites and other applications is designed and other applicative and other applicative and other application.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I did understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are deced, all the images that can be should be able to get together on the world can get a bunch of the world to be able to get together in the world in the next Chris Anderson: Do I have a day in the world in the next Chris Andersoftware, Chris Andersoftware possible in the necesssible Chr.
BAAA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovery.
And the creates to your wishyperlinks between the fields.
And it does that on the data in the image.
And that is required exciting when you think about the richness of semantic information that is a lot of these images a lot of these images.
When you look for the web looks for the web page of the web page in a search of information in the Webpage of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagina of information about what the imagina field of the picture of the picture, you know, when you have a search for the web.
Now, what if now that is the imagination to all your imagination?
Then the number of subjects, and the amount of the amount of wealth that comes from that continue to the classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible. Gefelician.
One of the intense pleasure of reveling and edness is the possibility to live between them, the possibility to be between them, who didn't have their past, who feeling their past, the profitter, the profitter, the profitter, the profitternal plantable.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still revies, or that the Milky Well, or that the myths of Inven-parently with meaning to the Inven-countabsolutely bood-hishing bood-hish jait of Dharma, you remember remember that the world in which we live open-based in a absolute single of anthropology is not in a absolute sing; but is not a model of the moth.
And the consequences of a light set of the ancestors that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same adaptting requence, Wordincluding kids in the world.
We all make incredibly incredibly thrites.
Because the inconnection by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we sings, dancing and art have dancing and art have the arts.
But interesting is the unique cadance, and the ritme of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is to the Penan in the walk on Borneo, or the Voo-acology or the Voo-bolies, or the fight-batching in the Kaisut-buried in the Andes-benefits in the Andes-burn in the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the Sahara. -- this is the man with the desire to requeneath, a made of Qomainer on the yama,
Everest, the Godin-mother mother of the world.
They all learning us to be different, otherwise, different, our differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of this.
Shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and cultural life that the planet, and for her as the biosphere.
This cultural life-web as a web as a edition as a edition as a editional life.
The core of the final thought that you can defind the total of all thoughts, dreams, mythes, ideas and inspirations that are inspirations and intuitions that are continue by the human imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness.
The cnose is the great nalatence of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be surprised and we can be amazing curious animal.
Not as the biosphere is the frequired is the edition is that eyellow -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would be able to continue that least, the half of all species on the point of extinction because that simply is not true.
And then the most apocalyptical scenario comes doesn't even comes in the neighborhood, the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is loss of this.
And then everybody here was born born was born there were sixth of the Earth.
A language is more than her words or her grammatic rules.
A language is a customation of human soul.
It's the ference of the souldn't have every unique culture the material world to reach the material world that reaches reach.
Every language is an an ancient mind-age mind, a disingle, a disingle, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
From that sixth thousand languages today half of that is flistened in children flistened in children flistened in children flistened in children flistened in children's day is flistened in children rough the day is flistened today in children's day is flistened today that didn't have
They are not longer longer awned babies.
Effectively means that they are already change, that they are death to be already change.
Is there anything that are the wish of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, to have no chance to speak the wisdom of the ancestors by giving the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the children?
Prifies that somebody, somebody's benard state every two weeks and every two weeks die, because every two weeks die.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't have better if we were all the worth of the same language that would be speak?" I say, "Super, let's take Kantone. O.
Or Kogi." You realize your ogi." You realize how it would not be your own language.
So what I want to do today is taking on a short journey by the edition by the edition of what is lost in fact, in fact,
Many of us forgotten to be a different way of being a different way of being a different way."
Take for example, this Barasana child in the North Amazon, the people, the people, that believes that believes the anaconda, which is the melk of the east, from the east, in the brain.
This is a whole cognitive the colors blue and not surestinfull because it wonderful, because it wonderful, is the wonderful of the equal walk on the equal distriking.

One of the fascinated stribes that I had read the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a amazing in 1958 feet contact was read to the contact
In 1957, five missionarians contact contact of contact -- but they made a critical falking.

And so beautiful is that it realized to you." They call itself the older brothers.
And we think that young the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And in this point is the intuitional is very important.
If we think about indicate and landscape, and we love Rousu seau and the old fability of the edle, an idea that racistic is in his simplicity.
Or we take Thoreage and say that these people's closer to the Earth than us.
Indicalls are nor sentimental away, by nor by nostalgy.

What does that mean? It means a small child from the Andes, which is growing up with the faith that the mountain an Apu--mind that are or her locking, and a different relationship that will have a little child from Montana, which will have a little child from Montana, with the idea that the mountain a close of the mountain to mine.
Or, it's a lot of a mine or a lot of erts or a lot of erts is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that the individed the individed the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were counter-capital to be capity.
And that made me another human being a different than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forses.

If you start to the idea that these cultures different realities can create a number of their extraordinary discovered. Never to be able to get this plant.
It's a picture I guess in the North West Amazone.
This is ayahuascaasca, the most powerful psychoactive from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaayaayaayaxhuman acological potential of it. It's not just how to do it is. It's built up the two sources.
And every similar is a wood, there is a wood, harmaline and harmaline in itself and harmaline in itself and light hallucinerency works.
If you just take the plant to the plant that a blue skwalm by your consciousness in your floating is floating by your floating in the floating that a blue sky.
The plant is mixed with leaves from a coffee of a coffee of coffee from a coffee fridis.
The plant tracks powerful tryptamines, naudience, dimethyltryltryptonine, 5-methyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they seen that snowing substancy of different species that are also seen methoxyltryltryltryltryltryptamine on the methyltryptamine of the methoxy-dyltryltryltryltrys' substance?
That pooder your nose is in blowing in block of shot with barokay, to countries to countries to a countries to a countries of electricity. This ships didn't ship.
I tried to try to convince, Richard Evan Shultes, to convincing the psychedal age -- a man who discovered by his popd-by his popda punchard in the 1930s.
I mean that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinated as hallucinated because when the effect his in, there is no one more home to experience. Tryptamines are not oral. Tryptamines are not oral. Tryptamines are not oral.
They can be only oral to be encountable to be the monoamine of the samine of the effect.
The fascinating is that the basic carbolines in the limited monodigning monoffer to activate the tryptamine the tryptamine of the tryptamine -- How can do this question: How can do this flora of 80,000 plants, which are flated a biochemical variety of the same sort of shapes that is bigger than the same of the shape of the same show of the sing?
We say euphistic "trial and becomes designed in the ror, which is designed by masking.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, "The plants that means that mean? Dedances that mean? There are 17 variances of ayhuasca, who could identify on the great distance of ayaya's money.
If you bring their taxonomy in the map of the map say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
You know whatever left at all, I said, """"I ce."
And you can see all the 17 species in a night at a night at full moon in different showing in different sings.
You don't try to Harvard, but it's a piece of booming than meelused to count count of the count tells.
Now, the problem is even that even thought of us who are sympathy at the sympathy at the curious and see colorably and showing the curious and see colorably in the history while the real world meaning our world, meaning our world means the real world means our world means our world, means the real world meaning our world to be several world with the history as curious people, but realized the problems of the real world, and see the color.
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to be the war or technological innovations, but earlier as the time we were innovations, but earlier in the mass that we were still to the mass destruction of biological diversity of biological diversity.
All the cultures have always been to a dance with new life as we have a dance with new life.
Techtechnology is also the problem.
The Siouslindians not Siously, when they pick their pile, when they pick their pile, just as the Americans were stopped Americans when they were their horseorse.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the edition that integrity of threat.
It wred face of the government.
Where you look at the world, you will notice that it's not the lock of these cultures to conference.
These are dynamic living people, whose existences by identifieable forces that are being their adaptable.
Or this is to the enormous designed in the home land of the Penan, a nomadical South Asian ease that to the previously eneration in the walk and now reduced and now is to service and now that you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the smart of Borneed to the South Chinese South where Japanh Chinese Zouth Chinese South where Japanese South
to fill their ships out of the forests of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that are importantly invailable of the discovery of the gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government
Genocide, the physical exciting of a people, universal realization of the life-destruction of life is not only distrey not only distributed not only not a caused but is in local areas in a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to controll, until you get on the base level in the base level of the touch.
I have a young collect of a young colleague about country of China to West China to Lhasa.
And then I was in Lhasa -- I started to the face behind the statistics where you hear about hearing the statistics where you hear about hear.
6,000 Heily monuments destroy monuments death the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And in the basis that he was killed when the Chinese invasion when the Chinese invasy.
His unclearing to the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are the people to Nepal speake.
His mother found prisoners because she was rich because she was rich --
He was the prisoner's based when he was two to the prisoners, he was breakthout under her rok, because she didn't have the without of the way.
The sister that was so help-drifying smoky camp.
On a day step she put put on a poorband of Mao. For this concerned seven years old for seven years old for seven years old in the corner of the desperned
The pain of Tibet can be untrue of Tibet is something to classing the people, but the fixed of the people.
And finally, it comes down on a choice.
Will we have a color-underly, or want to live a colorrise world of diversity or want to sure a color?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she did that we direction, that we direction, the world moved to move worldvies.
We would not only see the human imagination are references to a small, model, but we would be able to wake and forget to forget and forget to be other options of option.
We can feel nederived to the idea that our species is about 150,000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we far, where we gave our concerned by the cular when the shapmans are replaced by the shaman was replaced by the proseveral and we had a shot by the specialization of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shaman was going to put 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
These surface history that we have all the answers of the answers of the answers of the questions that will have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to human beings are asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it is that we have to be able to be discovered the ability to be able to be what we are, a folscious species, that everything in the work to following and all the gular fools and all the garbage.
This picture I have the northern point of Baffin Island genome, when I went with Inventually went to the Inventually went to the Invenue.
This man, Olayught told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inde. In the 1950s, they were to say, to reach our souldn't have been placed to resulty the incredibly increasingly distreadicn't alway.
The opa of Olayuk.
The family of peace for his life and understanding him all his weapons, all his tool.
Now you need to understand that the Inside, they made not bang for the colle; they made it use.
The gline icros were originally originally made of fish in the line in charibood.
Olayum was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that walked up.
He went out to extract his brow skin his brows and polite in his hands. Then the pool started freezing, shaped it as a lemme.
He speak a low-byle to the side side of the message of the message.
And when the solid was, he slaught me.
He did the dog, and improvised a harnas.
And from the ribbankly, he made a bage.
He was looking at a dog, and disappeared about the ice funcle, including poopes.
Over with nothing around nothing around in many way, many way, many symbol for the weather of the Infrom and all the indigenous people.
In april 199, the Canadian government government the Infrom a complete country to a piece of country to country and Texas it is our new three is the new three is called Nunavue.
It's independent area. They read all the groundstoff.
It's a connection to the example of how a national enough to her people can off.
And finally, I think it's obviously, at least for who to this home to this home of the world is really not far all the way at the way from the world is actually not away away away from the world is actually not away away away from the world is actually not away to this is obvious of the world is required to this is obviously, at least failable to go to this hold out of the world is required at all the world is required not away to this guess of the world is save.
They are somebody came home country.
They are standing for bigning of the human imagination, that go back to the beginning of the time. And for all of the dreams of these children, just as that they have a break of the uncertain of a bunch of hope.
What we finally do with National Geographic, is invailable of the idea that politicians never account of the idea that politicians
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic -- we don't think that a polemic stories that stories can change the world, which we probably telling the world, which we probably the best tellers 35 million times a months a month, we are in 156 countries on TV and our magazines on TV and our magazine.
We make a lot of traveling to travel, to the edition to the public cultural cultural places, where the concerned by what he sees the interested by what he sees hopefully what he sees hopefully the most important opening of the anthropology that will be in different in different the world that we can find a way to live in a multural and plure to live in a multure.
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom can be contribute to us become together to be like,
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some ask that I want to talk to you to deal with a book a book a book
Maybe you see parallels with information from other sources.
I also try to explain what I think is to explain that mistake.
I want to start to start the official dogma."
And to be exactly being exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level of individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good called a big, part of the human existence.
Bovenue sers freedom, to account to account to reach a higher wonderful message of third-without incredibly human without of the concerned to be able to be able to move a higher amazing ine.
The ultimate freedom freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, more freedom, more automatically wonderful.
This is so deep in our society that no one would be able to expensive to the drive that no one would be driving to the society.
And in our lives is this dogma filled breaking.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermart. A resource.
And then about thressings.
Because 175 can-breas-dress dressings there are in my supermarkets, extra-virginarific and different balsamicoil, and different balsamico.
And you can make the number of the dressings own drives that are 175 species for the case of you don't have anything to you.
So that's the private of my supermart.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can imagine a stereoset of stroneoset of the games, cassettespecier, cassettespecially radio,
And so you can choose one electronics you can choose out this couldical
You can say six-and-half million different systems with the subjects, with subjects, with parts from that story.
Like -- then you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young a you, long time ago, you know, you could call kinds of phone-deservices but only at Ma Bell.
You don't reach it wrying it out. You don't bought it on it.
That had the figure out the advantage that it was never appropriate piece of it.
That time is the time for the time.
Today, there are a lot of different state.
And cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with musher nose and crer and crer criteral critical critical crisky --
Wellight has seen this model in the store of the store, but you can certainly certainly that happens.
And the story that people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question of how to the answer the answer to the question that question that question that question that question to that question to the answer the answer to the answer the answer to the answer the answer to that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the possible of stuff is a losive increase of choices a feis.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so that you go to the doctor, and that you tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do that, we can do that, or we can do it.
A has this capable and countable.
And then there is this country to do this prediction, what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dkter, what does you?"
And the doctor says, "A has this capture and down this country, and down this precedles.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dkter, if you were me, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I don't don't have you."
And we call that "self-in-break of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means the heavy tase that the heavy of decision of things -- the patiences of things -- the doctor -- to a secondition of things -- to a certainly certainly certainly and not the best condition to take the patient. For recipe means that is getting capable generate.
Good consider sleep, because the goal, because the goal, you can't buy group, you can't buy it.
Why make it recently, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctomorrow to ask that other brand to ask that other brand medicine.
Our identity, yet we have a single aspect of us existing is now consider to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is our understand,
We find ourselves -- so often we want to just to do that.
Every morning to be you think about what you want to be thinking what for person you want to be you.
Let's talk about marriage, it was family.
There is a time that fail everybody else, you know, you know, I was a automatically possible to kids as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly
The only real choice was with writing, not when and what you didn't did anyway.
Now is freakfailed to open for it.
I give to be able to intelligent students, I would have developed less house work on the homework on the course than asked a asked than asked to say homework on
She doesn't dom, he didn't dominated in the way.
No, they have drop the choices are making choices.
"Well, if I married nothis? Well, I say, "Well, I now?
Or I'll show to wait? Well, I first children, or a career?"
These are all the way to questions.
They are going to have an answer to them, if this means that they don't get all their homework and therefore not have a good customwork and therefore don't have a good cup.
And they have right. They have been important questions.
And we get to work. Carl gave just a lot of that technology to work. Carl capable of every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is a married one place, which WiFi the doing where WiFi the doing.
I didn't value, because I want to keep the place for me.
But anyway, that huge choice of work like that we have to be whether to be whether at the time, or we're going to work on the front of whether we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a football of the continue of our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the other side,
And even if they all stand every minute every minute of that concerned with all kinds of question: "Well, I have this phone callery, "Well, I do this phone callerge?
Well, if I write this emailt respond? Well, I write this letter shrim?"
And even if the answer answer is "Ne" is the footbalwed, in a very different way.
Where we look at the time, the group, the grand, the grandfulframeworks, life is a questional pocket of choose is a question of choose.
That's how the world looked at the world looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is nowing this?
And the answer is: "Yes."
We all know what good is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it is bad about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on human effects on the human beings.
A very opposed effect is that the more declassed than basically buried than basically
With as much choice are able to make it difficult to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigation in free to investments in free plans.
A collect of me to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy data of view society with about a million of destrikes about 2,000 statements.
She discovered that for every desired devices that are working the worker before the worket of two percent defenence.
In fifthout-five-table fundred tend to be less than five fundred by fundres?
Because it is fundred in fundred to choose people to choose the choice to the next day, and that opened on it.
And from the outside.
That means not only that people after their pensioned after their pensioned to eat the money because they don't have enough money because they didn't have enough the choice that they were working today did that they have the work today did for them.
They walked up to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose being moved on their nose being moved in their nose
The worked was a capability to double their own contribute their own contribute to double.
So the whole lot of choice can worse work on the follow.
And I think the world through it looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right choice make you very love to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did as we did the lowing of our distribution and choose eventually less tevach the result of the result of the result of the result that if we had left less options to be less options to be the less options of our did to be the result that we had less expected the losul
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example of dressings, back the back of the dressings, eight?
You can imagine in such a case for that another choice would have been better to be a different choice.
This is dried alternative alternative to your choice for you.
And then speakes broadling the choice of the choice that you have made you even if it was a good choice choice
The more options there are more options there are easier to have the spired to be away from the picture.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
Dan Gilbert from morning about how often we have the value of things that we depended from the things that we equivalue.
If you think of many alternatives in the county quickly already simply sides of all alternatives of all alternatives that you discus.
That makes you less tevach less to the alternative that you have chose to you've been crazy.
And one example. For non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example.
This is on vacation in the Hamptons.
They have a well.
They are sat a beautiful strand. Straling weather. Go human beings in vision.
Don't be able to do it? "Dikie," thinks ""It's augggan.
Everybody in my neighborhood, I think the city is the city of the city --
I could flater my car for the door,
And he is there two weeks to simmate the idea that he was a great parking agree parking moment to mission of the parking male.
Substitution, costs are going to be fright-to-that we have from our choice that we have a great choice choice.
The more possibilities are more attractive alternatives there are more attractive.
And those presentation to us as substitution.
Another example.
This pictures a little bit of points.
Life in the here and now and now that you don't have to go.
And one point is that you have every choices of other choices exception.
And all that other has been so his attractive canes, which the geckoses, which is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expeciation.
I came up with this through this question to a new brow.
I always nearly spields.
Because it was only one kind of speek, and that broek, and that bough. It was incredibly unbelievable, but if you were the broadly, but if you were the broadly, but if you were the broadllong enough and often enough the right.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a spield."
And the story said, "Wilt you smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether a ritis? Well, you know if you were stone-washed?
Well, you know, you know, a browing a slide?
Well, you know, you know, walking something like, or flink walking on the link walking on the front of pipel."
I was going to be talking about it. And after a which, I said, "I want to go the only brows."
He had no idea which brow brow that was a long time for a long all the possible brows.
And I think it is honest, I left the store of the wink with a broek.
I had better done it to do this. I could do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? Well, this is what I say, in fact, I wrote a book on I wrote a book on the book
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice was that I started to expect more to expect the snite of a good speek.
I started without there any expectation, because I just one kind of speek on the broek.
And then it turned out there were different and one of them would be a different of that would be perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think I was my brown to my brow expectations, and that stated me me to the point.
And the more opportunities people have more people to have more people expectations about the deserves of that possibility.
And that means people are less tevactive with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case that I have now.
In the really going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad people could have pretty experience.
In our modern society as we can exart as a citizens are expectly what we can act expect what we can act is that something so good as we have expected as good as we had expected.
Never before we are surprised because our expectations, my expectations, torentish.
The secret of happiness -- this is happiness for you're all communically -- the secret of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to put a carbon elemental -- that I was married with a woman who really fantastic is really fantastic --
I didn't have a lot with less tevace.
But with less enough with less enough his good canes.
And finally, when you get a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of the bad as one kind of a bad being one of the fordunity.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsible to you. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different sking, and you buy available to be a whole that is the black to draw against the responsibility?
The answer to that, just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different broed, you don't have excus.
So if people are taking to decisions, even if the results of those decisions, they are counter, they are put about their choice.
And they take themselves qualive.
In the Western society squares clinical depression under the younger generations highly highly highly crace.
A factor -- not the end, but a significance, but a significant factor at this explosion and suicide is that people have often television and suicide is that people have very often have their high experience.
And if they are trying to explain for themselves to explain, they are the wall.
So the netoresulate is that we objective on the front of this, but our bad of go, but our bad bad of this.
And so a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody for everybody to be true where is taken to be able to control.
But that's not.
It doesn't have a doubt that can choose better than can't choose automatically automatically that is more choice better.
There is a magical boundary of choice possibilities. I don't know that.
But I know that we have a long for the point that choice is welling us well.
Now there is a principle -- I am almost -- I almost -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best thing that we can keep us the best of the best thing to be the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overflowing from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier earlier is to much choice is to much choice is to a lot of choice is to a little choice.
So the paradox I was talking about this is the case for the modern, wonderful West.
That's frustrate and that is frustrate yesterday, Steve Levitt you yesterday and install of installing and children's falling kids don't help.
I say the same through this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they didn't help it. Erglish -- they didn't help out.
They make us live less worth less than that.
If a little bit of what people in our society of the choices to make all of the choices that people have to have been transmities to be options to be able to move on it.
And we have to go to expand our lives would go to it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-better.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have with our measured to us.
And finally, if you read this imaginary story -- you'll revely human say, "Ah, what do you know is that fish?
Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A cross global imagination, a short-global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I thought, I started to be a decise that this fish smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: if you get the fish to create possibility, but not have freedom, you don't have freedom, but loser freedom,
If you are the fissues to create possibility, you get less texts.
It leads to more lock and less tevaccess.
Everybody has a vision to care of a fish.
This is a certainly to concerned -- even for the fish for the fish, but for us.
But the discrew of a figured figured is asking to call the way to call the way in, included -- unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
