For, I showed this two dia's shot to show the police cape that the past three million year, the size of the vastance of the vastance of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem is the worth of this specific problem because it disectory isn't the ice of the ice.
The ice clip, the North Pole is in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crinter and crink in the summer.
The next slide I show is a version of what the past 25 years of what the past 25 years happened.
The permanening is redly dived in red.
As you see, it looks at dark it from dark to dark and dark it from dark and dark it from dark to dark and you see,
That's the yearal ice of the winter.
And it crack in the summer.
The called permanent, five years or older or older, is almost like flower, which is the body is five years.
In 25 years of this is going to go to this form.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrate and there's a very great amount and there's a very great amount of fairly cutter, when it is designed by microbes in methan.
And, with the total higher amount of the atmosphere, which would be doubled amount of atmosphere, that can doubled the corn.

On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole is the largest ice mass on Earth.
People course, scientists scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the ice of the South Pole is very quickly very quickly corners with a bunderwaters and subbited islands.
The whole continent is before six meter sea legal continent of six meters like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the biggest ice mass, there are new now new now that are new now a few years ago, who were a few years ago.

There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also drows it drows the drink water.

In the past five years we've been 70 million ton CO2 hours --
25 mix ton every day in our oceans, and the Indian area of the Stille Each Ocean, from America, ast, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drawing of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is designed to 20 percent and the burning of the Earth, is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stone, and the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extension of the outsize of China.
And there was a propossible of more cities.
But we see a course.
These are the urcharge of the building was annulearning in the past years, and where green were green alternatives and where green alternatives were being the last carbon years.
There's real political stribute in our country.
The cities, and oil industi-industig year, 250 million dollars to promote "sone" and courage.
And that image me to think about something that I think of something that think of something that I think that you think of something that I think of something that I think of something that I think of something that I think that picture.

Formous year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that machine.
So here's me. For those who didn't have anything that the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever suburies, 27 miles in the course.
It needs to the circumstances that were corners that were less than a billion second second the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, this!
This is the machine,
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called ATLATLAS detector -- 22 meter in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in a bold so you can see the scale.
At 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That was a party for a party care in the controlled room.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all the way around the LHC gone around the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and piece of the LHC, and particles in the detector of the skor of the LHC, and
In other words, when we saw that photograph that photograph the machine, we knew that the machine, which is a huge overwhich, which is a huge over.
I don't know this is the largest of the biggest of this, or then, somebody to Google and saw the Internet page and saw the Internet page and the Internet page of this.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold these gold behavior.
And that better shows 13 thousand thousand amples when the machine, the powerful power.
The engineers under your engineers will say, "Not that they're going to be able to say, "Not small be."
They can do that because they are superceither superature on whole lage temperature and
So on min 271 degrees than the space between the stars, who can destribute that behaviors that behavior.
In one of the connections between the nets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And the wire of the wirelectrical wear, and there was a distance that 13 thousand amples that 13 thousand amponds.
This was the result.
This is still inpressive your realizes that magnets more than 20 tons that are more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeters were going to put 30 centimeter.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of it.
We all have been reparated them.
Now they are back to away them.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will be able to put him again, and we expect measually in juniverse that we can go to the expect what the building building the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe and expectations in the front of the universe of the universe to be able to be able to be able to go to the further and expectribuilding it again.
Now, of course, who have inhappened to debate the debate of scientific research.
I think it's really hard to be hard to be so hard to be beyond beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I dissed, during the value of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so much for the progress than to take our images of human minds than to take our images of the science, and that there are not engineering our images in nature, and that we are completely design, and that we have been design, and that we are not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do compleart defectoomystersterivalivalivalivievietoot designertake the readadadadvantake the ready be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Thank you very much!
I would want to start to ask you back to your childhood and and and and you play with block and play with block.
When you discovered how to go to understand how to go to understand and and award the device of the decision of the course with the depended by the cumultial relationships.
Ruimphone is strong across the world to understand the world to understand us.
If an information us, inspired by the native of physical interaction with my advisoral interaction with my advisor Pattion and my medefish -- what if we could use a computer Jeee Kalanithi -- what if we would use a computer, in place that entire engineering ength of the engineering energy and information that we can information with a plate information of information that we can information with a plate information that we can information with a moviture.
and can we orders and as we want to lear?
This question of us so decided to search an answer that we decided to search the building of Siftables.
Cort samental is a Siftly a Sift-basically a interactive computer in a cookie.
They can be able to do with the hand they can be able to each other, their movement and they detect a screen and they came a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understand the physical handled and block and block it by fired by fired by fire.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And before these aid are a more physical different physical different of their motion and each other, and even of the way we have to move them and including the way we move, there are different new and slide interactions of the interactions of the way we are interactions of the way we have to discovered.
I will start with some simple simple examples.
This Sift is instimagine a video to show a video provided and othersice and othersice and othersice and othersice.
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious conscious conscious of each other.
Indies next to each other, they will be interest.
If they are curring this and they can be able to be what they are being this and become a little bit of being this.
And they feel a movement and hell.
We realized algaust, that one of the interesting of this interesting of the interaction, the using of all of the interaction, as it was a color of a color was a color of a color was a color of a color of a color of the same was a color of the same of the interesting of the interaction, as the individual and realized the inside of the interaction, as the individu
In this example, three Siftables of the emmercial remarkable to make color in a legal to go color in a leg, where they are being inside.
If we government, we gotten what we return back to the basically.
There's some clear cumber possibilities for education, mathematics and logics and logics that we want to give people to try and logics where people are possible, and the result of inside and result the result of the educating of the education.
Here's a set -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmmatic programmatic programmmatic programmatic of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci resourci of a F
Here's a game between a crosson between Scrabble and Boggle and Boggle and Boggle and Boggle
The principle is that you are in every raround a raround letter around any Siftable, and fremed words are controlled words, and fremed word in a dictionarietable,
And after about 30 seconds it is becoming resember and different a new series of series of general possible.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I have a video of it.
They were really really, there were realizing.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly nearly nearly instructions that people need not instruction.
Everything you need to say "Make word" and they know what they need to do.
Here's some other people on the tests.
That's our young benta tester, right-beneful.
And it seems that he just just the Siftables of steple the Siftables of step.
For him this blocks.
Here's a interactive painting a interactive painting
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonster demonst.
He can take new caraker in the scene of the scene with that carakes the Sifty of the table.
He sun, he sun.
Video: The Sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene brow.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done any! Yeah!
By the shape of Siftables and the next to each other, he can reach others lath other, We're going to reach other.
DM: and so his own story and tell story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open of open end.
and he decision how it decision and he decide.
Video: The catch flying air.
DM: The last example I will show Is I will show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed a sound sound, where every Siftables and the drum.
Eengineering variations, where you can choose seeing variations, which you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables so that you can be injected to pattern itself.
You place a sound in the pattern of a leg Siftly Siftable effects live control, and filter.
They are being a sound and attack and attack by cancers.
And before the general effects like tempo and completely that are applice and completely pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern of a first pattern by a first pattern by an extra lead.
Now, I place the base line and
Video: Now I feel a little bit slagghtly work.
Video: And I think of the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can infect live the effect live in the effect live live in the effect of the drumber to the filter of the drums of the drumber to the filter of the drumber to the filter of the filter of the drumber to the filter of the d
Video: I can do it accelerated by the obvious of the temo block you.
Video: Now I buy the filter of the baas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can replay repearing while the play;
So I don't have to planning everything to plann, but I can improvisering it all longer and shorter longer and shorter like I want.
With the dimms of the dimms of the end, and the entire left to the left left to the left left showing to the left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of new people's new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain interfaces our brain and bodies work.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some possibilities that we developing the developing of the developing of the developing of the lab.
The real minute that I want to talk about is that this is just the courage generation to a very new generation of interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hear.
I look at you to talk to you all and talk to you.
I'm writing
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I am all of writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there is unless the ength of my life, and career and career and career and career, I had to be my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career
It started with a book I discovered until I discovered a memoired "Ets' Bible -- Biinning in the opposed to my early work and an international except the world.
The result is that people are now and always dragged and always I came up and always dragged in the called me.
Worly, what -- does where --
People come to me and asked me and asked me and asked me to ask this success that you can never ever event?
Don't you know, you don't see your entire life is going to stay writing and writing more a book that people are going to be able to hear warm where people for warm to hear?
You don't you afrais?"
Ery distribute.
Of course, that would be very much that I remember 20 years ago, I was a tener -- I was a tener -- I was a tended to be a teenad.
People said, "You don't you afraid you never get success of success is going to get never success?
Don't you know, you don't go afraising, you can understand doing it through you?
You don't know that you are your life to this work on this work without that there is anything and you will be able to be able to destributed your broken and broken up with your bitters of bitters of fail bitter?"
Something in that stretching
In the short comes my answer to that questions questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are being called
Always the same time.
But I also am for a lot of other things that all of things that all of it.
For sea bunch of the example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that comes from, where that comes feet.
Is it ration?
Is it logically that somebody is eight being the work for work to their opinion on on Earth of the Earth are set of the Earth are cut?
What is so basically increative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mindness of the mindness of the mindness of the work of work on the work of work on the effects of work on the effects of the work of the effects of the minute.
Take my father. He was skull, and I can't remember that there was a remember in the 40 years that he was working he was not based to him and he didn't have any for it.
And so from "John, how it is it with your chemistry block?"
No, no, there was not a talking about it.
To be fair to be able to be engineers have been by the century not the reputation of manical, piece of manicical-depressive alcoholists.
Supon writers that have been reputation.
Not only writers other creative people have reputation to be reputation human beings.
Look at the grimmic dodential dodental under the most magnificant creative minutes of the 20th century.
Mantly diep young, often by own own own to do it.
And even those who are not a suicide of course, under their gaves are individual to be concerned to be concerned to be concerners.
In the last interview for his death of his death said "Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a very basically what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of extension of this kind of looking at the time.
We all heard it before and have heard it with side all accepted.
The crazed thought is that creativity is involution, and that a artist, and that a artist, and an artist, and an artist, and an artist,
So I want to ask everybody here today, you ask with that idea of life?
Do you know that OK?
Because I think about it is a well-mind I think about it all the way I don't think about the pretty though.
I think it's reference.
And also another dangerous.
I won't see that this century this century is that this century.
We can creative mine a lot better ators to live better.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, is dangerous to that dark and life.
Searly the fase where my career, where my career now is now in.
Go one, but I'm going to young a young amper right year.
I can maybe I can work four decades work.
Heastprobably will be anything I will have to publish the outside world as the world as the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're friends, so I can do you friendly smell you probably smell my greatest success of behind me.
Jemically what a idea!
If you think of your mind, you're going to be the morning to real hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I like thought I love with the work where I love with the work where I love it.
The question is, "Do is: "Do
And after long after a long after a long lusion as I can only be a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of the process of inbuilding as I ended a psychological protection.
I need to create a safe distance between myself and my government between myself and my over, and my conversation of reactions in my future and my future of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the reactive.
I have been looking at the past year, I discoupt to ways that.
I am in the history and have been doing in other civilizations to see or others have found or others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been based to the old Gred and Romeins.
Let ope, because it's a long and complicated.
In the time of the old Gred and Romeins and Romeins dividual that creativity was coming from hendly itself.
Men believed that creativity was a good mind mind that was a godness, which was a real place and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks called these tremendous minute being creativity "demonen."
And, Socrates believed that he had a demon who had a demon who influistered words influistered it.
The Romeins had a kind of same idea.
And in them, named them a crazy creative mind a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, not a genius,
In their police was a genius, a kind of magical reses that ophips in the walls of the atell of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the artist, the genius,
And the research, he gave the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the destance that I had the first earlier ded the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work in his work.
The artist, the artist, in protection was taken a lot of narcism.
If you work bread, you didn't all the edge there.
Everybody knew that a unvisible, which you had healthy.
You know, you work up work in the work of you.
Everybody knew that you have a very understand a very understand
Long time is that field, the may creativity was being the Westen creativity was being
And then the Renaissance, and everything happened
There's a very new idea very new idea: the individual humans is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space mystical behold from the godness of the godddressing world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual way.
And for the first time in history was the history of artists were saying a genius, and they didn't have a genius.
I need to say I have to say that a big faile.
To one person, one person, one person, one person, one person believe that he or she or the field, the essential mystery, the essential mystery, of everything is to be a lot of the ear, creative and the familiar and the familiar human psyches.
As you asked somebody asked the sun in sun.
Egos are reading up to gigantic proportions and unimaginable higantible higantions of prestations and exprestations of prestations and
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists capot made capot.
If that is so I think is that is the question, "What now what now now do?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back understand back the relationship between humans and creative mysterion?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years rational humanism not uncomfortable to make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the real sponse.
Probably are in the audience people who read reading the idea that have been reading the idea that edge of edge beings with some feeditial pooder the work of artists to inspiration,
It doesn't seem to be getting you.
I asked it up, I went to me.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that minute?
It's just so much highly highly as the other explanations of the total makes of the total incularity that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something that has trying to create all the the same of all the same creative process -- knows that the creative process of the always --
That sometimes almost paranormally invitude.
I have a recently understand the great American closer Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the majority
She is close in the next. Her lives all the life they directly close.
She told me about her jugght on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was work on the work was working on the work of close close of country.
It was, so said so, there was a big wave air, a big wave air.
Some-poem golf than the country to her her it.
She felt that the ground, and shake her feels and shaped that her her to do and shape that moment but one thing one thing to do is to her life.
And they running home, and she had to go home, and she had to be so quickly as possible.
When the close was close to her her one, her only her any chance to write it on the close of her enter.
Sometimes it wasn't failed enough.
And then running and running and running it doesn't be the house
And the close moments of close close of her and put it by her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another another closer -- to another closer --
And also, there were a certain -- this find I think the beautiful part of the story -- they almost mistake.
And then she was in the house and paper and paper piece of pieces of its its its it.
Juist on that moment she had a potter than a potter of pack
And with her other hand, so told me she poeded it the poem of air.
And she picked it back to his reart, and pick it back in her body in her body and she wrote the course.
In that cases the close close of piece of piece, but then in the case of paper and closed follow.
When I heard that heard -- what happens to happen to be my creative process of creative process of my creative percent of creative percent of it.
This is my creative process of creative process noth!
I'm a musile, who every day on the same time, every day and sweet and sweet and trans and trans energy and trans energy and trans distrial result.
But even in that day I have had been a question I have been a experience of experience.
You will also be able to know it itself, that there creative ideas in your burning ideas in your bron that you can increative you an impossible.
What is that four?
How can we use it for using without that we become us?
On a way that are that well?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think is musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine for a magaze.
We had the reason this.
And in fact, a great part of his life had been part of his life had been shown of the course of the course artists that tries are trying to get all the power to the unconvertational creative impulse creative impulse that in him.
With the 1990s Tom what small right away rough.
At a day he read in Los Angeles about the speed the process of radical.
And as he was so realize the fragmental of a melodia.
The decided him, as inspiration that is does understand usual corn.
It was a beautiful eloid and he wanted to fasth.
But it didn't be that.
He didn't paper piece, no apero-order at itself.
The amazing exciting except again, "I recoming the melody and then it turns me returning me and then it turns me to be eating the familiar backs.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He real real real didn't stop the entire process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry heard the govern, I behind the go?"
"Don't you really know I can now describe a song of you?
If you really want to be able to get later, you have to do another another thing if I have to do you.
Now, you know, somebody else to fall of the time.
Go neighborhood-neighborhood." And from that moment of the process of the process of the process of the process of very different different
The work itself is the same thing, with the dark of the dark of the same top.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him reflect to him the creations of genius.
The genius, and close close and skin the skin and skin the skin and the skin and close close and skin the skin and close it up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through this.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre ship, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that not very much of Tom itsel.
That story has changed my way of work changed.
I have been profound in the way of second.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biinners in the writing Ettom.
At a gives moment I in spire in despair.
You are that well, you know that you want to work and you think it is a terrible disaster to a terrible disast.
Not six, not bad, really, really diswer bad bad bad bad bad.
I wanted to do it all the project of the whole project I wanted to do all the project of the whole project all the project of the whole project I wanted to do it all the time.
And then I remember Tom that I remember to be enjoy and I decided to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be currently and I decided to be a power
I went from my manuscript and I didn't have a legal hunt of the room of the room of the room of the room and I was a legness of the room of the room of the room.
And I said hardop: "Lister this, we know all this, we know all this, if this is this book is not only by me.
You can see I have all of the things I have in the stop I have in me.
More can't give it.
If you find that it better can, you have to be you.
Snap you does? Do you don't know that, jamber thane.
I just write down because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notes. And so much of the cumble are basically difference."
Tjaj--- United it comes on the right --
Euws was there in the North African desert African desert people to dance to dance months to dance music to dance music to dance music to dance in the North African desert music to sact in the N
One and hours and hours and fundressing lors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometimes a lot of something like this, something happened,
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you've ever seen anything that I mean, you know, you know, a performer.
It was like the time still still and the dance of the stack of a step.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights, but now everything together.
And the suddenly read he didn't leave a human being.
In him, under him, under him, under him,
A good fired him corner.
If the one thing happened to happen to people what it was Dan and what it was Dan and set and class and called "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical fact that I say the Moren South South Spanel Spanel -- they broke this common with it.
The cumber is real real returned by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oy."
That hort you today and the day of the day and flamengoddances.
If an artist, an artist, or magical or magical does people, "Allah, other, Allah, olold age age."
Anderstand and, souldn't a glimb of God.
Precions what we need it.
Lastig is real the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to the next of 11 hours not godable law more and the morning charge law more and the morning charge.
And at that moment is he again, a little bit of parently cumber to be more early to be more to such more to such more to such more again.
Maybe never going to be a one more someone God attack of the dance.
What to he's rest of his lives?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show to show to do for a creative mind.
But so painful is not need to be able to be not need to be
Imagine not a bit of except that most uncomplainable to your person -- yourself.
Imagine you believe you that you have a while, you know, a while's not a whiled of specificate of specificate source.
When you ready close them, they are ready to somebody else.
And so, it tool.
I handle inflassed that though.
The last months I worked on a book that inside a book that inside a lot of that is going to be able to reach and reach reach and reach response and reikhalf and reach response to a book that inside of a book that inside a book that inside of a book that inside a book of course.
The follower of that illuster progress.
If my mind minute, I stop the hall, I stop the same thing, I still the same thing that there is not a bane.
Doo just your work.
and just flyer you do this, what it is.
If it your task is to dance, thank you very dance.
If the goddeliiver that you are decided to decide in your work on enil of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources by the wonderful sources of the wonderful of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources of the wonderful that you.
Now, does it happens -- through it down through it.
And also then, "Olon!
I believe that harted.
"Olong one, because we are from pure human love and own human loved and own wisdom by blood.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olong on!
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can meaning new sets of genes.
We started to go from a new point of point, we were the digitalize of the digitalizers, and now we try to a new fase in the biology to go to a new fase in biology and synthetions of lives.
So we tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living?" And what I think is a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different level of different level of different level of different level of biologists that I tried to understand what have tried to do is something that I tried to understand what is lived to do is something that I tried to understand what is lived to do is to
We tried to have different approached to minimute, it returning leggetting less to minimum components.
We're now going to be the digitalizers.
When we have sequence, the human genome sequenced, it was from the analog world of the computer.
Now we try to ask sure we try to live regenerate new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe of this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a kind of a that can be a kind of a matter,
And we tried to look at a nice smaller genome to a none.
We can go from the order of hundred generate generate 500 or so, which are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map cands that relative simple with the unction.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can extend to be a living cell that this would be a living cell cell of the cell would be cell to live all the genes that we can go to all the genes that we can look at all the genes that this is a living cell cell cell and the piece of the genes that we can expect piece
We decided that the only route previous pretty this chromosophim so we could depended the components to be so that we could depended the componenty of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started questions with questions of course, "Can we started a chromosop?"
And the chemistry it the chemistry that we never seen before we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can be a chromosable?
A chromosophim is married a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelerating exponential well.
Our power to writing the genetic codes to write the genetic code.
And our last point would be on this moment would place the exponential curve.
We're going to be more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethic tooling again,
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be very hard.
There's a thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it fail, the more folks of it.
So we had to do a new method for the sact of these little pieces and the corrigate all the fouts.
And this was our first purpoging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the mistakes --
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the inerent when we piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria of the genetic code genetic code the genetic code and viral particles and make viral particles global particles and make viral particles
The viral particles were closing the cells, they came out of the cells, and they came back and dead the E.
I was unless the oill industry, and I said that they model but I said that they model but I said that model but to gotten thought snaps.
They laught over you.
So we think this is a situation where the situation where the software o-too, in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to do it full bacterial chromosophist.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassetttles, so we could cut the cassettles, so we could cassettts, so we could fired the cassetttles.
and understand what the real realizes of a living cell of a living cell cell
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer,
When we first first first of this genome is the standard in 19995 was the standard precision one per 10,000 baseparat.
And then we found after we found after resequencing 30 folates. If we had used the original sequence of using used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to star
And the design of the design is design pieces that 50 letters long who are over 50 letters of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so they can be designed to design.
We designed here, we designed here.
Maybe you have read and you read water now we have water in stopping water now.
And I think of this: we have a square genetic code: A, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Trios of those letters are codes for 20 aminozursing -- there is a only clearning for each each ozure.
So we can use the genetic code to writing words and writing words and direction.
Avanced called "The basically only we only could.
Some of course, and curling close that there were no poember close
We have been designed this pieces that we can design them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and they put in each other.
And we started doing pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters long long and you have pieces of 24,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,0000.
In every city of this piece of course, we flouring these pieces so we could sequences a process because we want to create a process that is very road.
We try to reach automatization of automatization
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of the basketball of the basketball of a basketball of the basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketbal.
And as we come to the really great pieces of the really great -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow easy more in E.
That is the expect of all the modern of all the modern of modern modern biology.
So we went to be red to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist, which is used by the biology to repart by the biology to reparers, that pieces together.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiods.
And you see that in the top paneal, soon chromosside, and the chromosophister of each other.
12 hours later, he put it in the again, exactly the weather, as it was first of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are this.
These organisms can completely regular.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space in space that can existence, a new aquatical environment.
NASA has married show that there is a lot of of it, there's a lot of of there.
Here's a real micropphoto of the molecule, that we made with these processes -- fact that we made a gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we were in design.
It is a care that they automatically automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscoppphotograph; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a great moleculecule, we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish we includes indeclasses.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest moleculecule of people, with human, with a clearly structure.
The moleculeculecule, more than 300 million sms.
If we would be drops with a 10-points of puntter, and there's 142 pages only take the genetic code only to present the genetic code age of the genetic code age of the genetic code of the genetic code of the puntter, and then there's only 10 pages and the genetic code of the course, and if
Good, how do we start a chromosophister up?
With a virus it's clearly easy easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you live under eukaryots, as we just whether you whether you whether and doing another in, and that's what you know if it's clong.
And the bacteria of the bacteria of chromosophim in the cell of cell in the cell transplant transplant of a chromosal transplant of a chromosing of a cell to another, and it can active.
We have a chromosophister of a micromosly species.
These are about so far of each other, as people and mously moved as people and mouss.
We figured some extra genes so we could have a genome so we could select to be selecter.
We have the reflect with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the egs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will will be the very avanced graphical images here, and the new chromosh of the cell of chromoshe.
We even thought he would come to be able to be able to develop the process of developing what further from developing the process of developing what we were going to be able to developing the process of developing what we tried to develop the process of developing out of developing the process of developing and they were tried to developing the process of developing that he would be able to developing the process to develop the process of developing of developing of develop.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of of these are a second chromosophister or a third genomes or a third of thousands of own and own thousands of propertypes of own in one times of the species.
People who evolution evolution eventor any one of the biology is not a lot of biology communated a lot of biology and
There are enzyms that restriction are enzyms that really called DNA resources.
The chromosophim that in the cell has not ever been there.
The cell -- the chromosophistopped -- well,
It was expression of the other chromosside of chromosophistrange material, and why we had been doing it up, and why we had only the cell of chromosope.
He was blue the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time the new kind of the cell of the one of the one species of the one of the kind of based in the new kind of based in the new kind of based on the new software that we stop in the cell had stop.
All the engineering changed the genetic code -- when we change the genetic code -- the genetic coded was exactly the genetic code in which it was changed.
This is a may be clines like genomic, but we are in the software tribute the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things
Good, I have been paid better that this is not a skulty crazy -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have a new version years ago, and I have a new version of the Camburn explosion of the Camburn of the Camburn of new species where there are big scaling in this digital design.
Why would you do this one?
I think it's fairly clearly if you look at what it is needed is clearly when you look at what there.
We're going to be corner from six-en-six-ended people, during the next 40 years.
To place it in my context place in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets.
every of us that are in 1946, in 1940 years will be that there are four years.
We have a moved with food, with the cornervous water, medicine the six-ended billion the six-ended billion the six-ended billion of the six-endrugs.
That's going to be last, to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion ton collecton collecton of collector.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
When we take biological processes in ogencous process than anything to replace that is a huge challenge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge to replace that is going to be a huge challenge to replace that is a huge challenge challenge to replace that to replace that to replace.
Then there is a course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere and then
And all of our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gentle, and I would like to see as the designs for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozen done different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We are limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a techniques technique synthesemethods to do so called "combinations of combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of called "combinations to be so called "combinations to do so called "combinations that called called "combinatic synthese.
We've now the possibleility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you work on the work of 20 million different genes or trying to optimalize processes to make octan, new vaccine, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can do with a small team of team and we can do more molecule, we can do more moleculecule.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatable unity, chemical or fuel, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real designs that we work on work on the computer we work on the computer and a new kind of the computer.
We don't know how it will see it from the business will see it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of the genetic code
We now four on generation now in fourth generation of fuel
And you see the flu flu to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and the generation that are going to come inside the inside of the things like sugar, to more higher fuels like octan or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have biology without the food-price higher and the available price and the available of the food and the available of food and we think of the way that we start designs that it it in way, and we think that we are the first sources of the first generation that are fired fuel in about 18 months inside about 18 months in understand
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but our global discovered all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles of the slives in the deep of silometers.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 corn, which is easy via pipels to factory where CO2 is casion to fabried this process to fabried this process to fable, to sture this process of course.
So in a short time we think we are in a short of basically basically asked on the basic question, "What is liv?"
We actually have a real, you know, the case of the case of the purchemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this, where you don't do this, what?
A major energy source.
But we work now is using these works, to think set fast, we work fast.
This year, the flu was the flu -- we always just something behind the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change by testing vaccines of depends of decines.
Here's how the future of the future of evolution is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually evolution.
We're defenced from the improved people.
Our goal is certainly to sure that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that maybe you make. Thank you.
What I want to show you a fundament of a new technology that we have to show you a new technology that we are in a conversation, and this is Seedragon. This is Seedge ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you local local dator with immense amounts of visual data can work on the fields.
We look at this many gigabyts, and we can see this digital images and can be came to stay and extension and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of course.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at this collections or images are the collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixal.
It all doesn't matter because the only thing would be influences to influence, on a thirs system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book example of the data.
This is the graum of Dickens. Every collecture.
To providing that it's really too, and not imagine, and we can do something that this is not a picture, to show this is not picture.
Maybe this is a set of a bunch of strange book a e-book.
I won't reach it again.
This is a realistician. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big picture, the beginning of a particular part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper and the capital paper or capital medium.
We also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising a normal resolution -- much higher than a normal advertish advertish information -- and extra information information information information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the limities of actions of accounters of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other thing.
Of course, course, a course to the hand course a technology like this, I don't want to spend time to this field -- and except that we can spend a lot of this field
These are all the weighth in the U.S.
And the top of the top of the NASA --
Let's look at something different.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of Washington of Washington, promove to the University of Washington, and the decided by Steve U.Washington, by Steve U.Washington,
and Rick Sself Sself Research. A beautiful society. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images of the images of the images here.
The computering algorithms have been pictures these images so that they coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades in the Canades of stable, and you see elements of panorama or panor, and all these things are space are panor, and all these things are space of these things are space -- and all these things are space of the panormal of these things are count of the certain the Canormous of the computer.
I don't know sure or there is a certainly environments of the environments of time.
There are a lot of space are a lot of space are a lot of space there.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth synth that we were working this summer -- to communicate what I have in my head in my head of this technique, at the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to be count with the advocature and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dake with image -- you see just Notre Dake the Notre Dasasask in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the camp
And every of this orange eyes of this orange is a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of model of this model of the model of this model.
And so this is all of Flickr images, which are all of this way that are space in this way room of space
And we can case on simple navigerous.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would work.
It's conversation to be so far here.
I believe you can see that this many types are camera's camera's cameras, a big attack of mirror cameras, a great at, saccumber of these environment.
I will try to find some weird images.
There's so much breaks so much of it.
Acording between this, even a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also is good cheating by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do is that we can really do with social environment. This uses the data of all collective memory of the whole collective memory on the other.
All these pictures are being each other and form is a very bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the design Earth is
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtuell Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses use, and value the use, and value the people who are using it.
Their own photos are being metaphor-data who somebody else somebody else
If someone would like anybody to click and their names and their names and their names and the core Dake again, my picture Dase, and I can use as a access to that metaphold that metaphold to that metaphold of course, and creating a kind of course modits of cross-modless moditial social experience.
And of course, the by-product of this imments a realm of a immense of every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from air, who only not only from air, satell images and other passings and other passings and other passings.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what your software possible, in the next years, all the images that are deviolence on the world that are deceither on the world can buy on the world together?
BAA: Yeah. What this really is discovered.
The creates create, to your wishyperlins between images.
And it does that on the data in the data in the pictures.
And that designed spanning when you think about the richdown of the richdom of these imaginformation that mantic information that many of these images.
When you look at the web and you look for image, you look for a search and the text of the web, and the text page of what the image information about what the image reflect of what the imagination of what the image referre.
What if now that are the image is to all your picture?
Then the number of the substantic connectic connections and the amount of that comes gigantic networks. It's a classic networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible.

So it can't surprise that we all sings, dancing and art art and art art and art art and art art art of the art of the art of the art of the art of them.
But interesting is the unique of the song, and the ritme of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the corn, or the Vood-As in the U.S. or the U.S. or the fight-bated-bits in North Kenya, the Curothero in the Andes-ben-burning or the Caravanced in the Sahara -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- -- this is the managed by the month, a made aircumber of the whole of the holangolang-ma,

If you think about it, you can only give this idea of this.
Shams the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and the cultural of the planet as the biological lifesssweb: the biosphere.

A language is a catch of human souple of human soul.
It's the fertainly value that the sical world culture the material world is reaching material world reach.

One of the fascinated tribes I have read the Waorani in North Ecuador, a reasting completely in 1958 feet of fairly in 1958 few frequired to contact
In 1957 tried five missionariss contact contact and critical folt.
And the air streamed photos of themselves with our ideas, where they go to our ideas, where they did never seen a second dimensional pictures that this following picture.
They went the photos and tried the form behind the face behind the face of the face of the face of the face of the face and tried the face of the photographs and tried the form of the photographs and tried the form behind the face of the photographs and triewed the form of the face.
When they didn't found anything they found that the duniverse of them ried here, after the missionarian with speak of speak with speak
But the Waorani doesn't only extension of the course, but each other.

where all the wisdom of all the volution of all the volution,
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions, I want to talk to uncl I unctioned a book of course.
Maybe you see parallels with information of information from other sources.
I try to explain some connect to explain that you may be mistry.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly being the official dogma of all the Westerse, industrialized society.
And that official dogma ligma light set of our neighbors on the highest level of our neighbors on the highest level individual freedom.
Freedom is a great, a great, a essential part of the human being existence.
Bovenualize freedom to reach own to reach own insight, to account a higher makes to invite without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically more probably wonderful wonderful.
This is so did deep in our society that nobody would take anybody to be during in our society.
And in our lives in our lives is a dogma stick celebrated.
I will give you some examples of our modern choician.
This is my supermart. A resource.
As thressings.
And the 175 opportunitial resource resources are in my supermarket, in my supermarkets extra-virgin old virgin oil virgin the bar.
And you can make the number of the case ressings own three between 175 species for you,
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can stroneoset of the game -- airls, cassettespecially -- cassetttespecially --
And so the one electronics and electronics you can choose this attack of this attack.
You can see six en-half million different systems with the systems with the botts, with subjects.
Give to, you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could all sorts of telephonservices and all sorts of course, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't cryed it it turn.
That had been trying to do it before it took a benefit was going to be a benefit of this.
That time is the time.
Someone of the words are very much different experience.
And, for cell cell phones is the diversity is the diversity is the diversity.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the average -- that with middle -- with mi-legal croom-ber and crist critical else.
Wellight you this model in the wink of the wink of the moment, but you can certain that inside the inside of the inside of the inside of the wink of the wink of the wink of wink and you can see this model of the wink of the moutside of the inkle of the wink of the ink
The crazy and asked this question and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question that question to the answer question of the answer question.
No,
It's not possible, a mobill that don't do a lot of it.
As in aspects of life that are much more important than the society of spultive spull of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of spull that are much more important than the attack of spulultive, and the cously of choice in aspects of spultance.
Suncare -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. and you told you to the doctor, and you tells you what you must do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says "We can do that, we can do that, we can do that.
As this form and a brease.
And the obvious and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is do?"
And the doctor, "At this form and the Big is this observice and the course.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you way, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not not you."
And we call the patiently of the patients."
That is very positive, but means in fact that the sware task of decision of someone with case ship -- the doctorn, someone who is the freedom, someone who has been certainly secertainly and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient of recives -- the patient of records are generaling ready geneable.
Good providing that ners that ners, because the purpose group, you and I can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why do we make a real make, if we can't buy them?
Because they think of the next morning to ask our doctor to ask that other market medicine.
And our idents, yet a brible aspect of us existing us, is now overwhile you can see this dia.
Our identity is ready of our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every every one of the morning of the early and you want to be what you want to be you.
Let's talk about the skin the again.
There's a time that freedom, everybody else, everybody else, and then you know, as quickly possible, and then so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible.
The only real choice was with wrong and what you did doesn't do and what you did did.
Now freedom, all of all for the oprap.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I developing 20 percent minder housework house,
They are not dom, and they are not domber than in early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices with choices.
"Well, I married or noth?
Or I will wait? Neake I first children, or a care?"
These are all set of these are all so.
They go through to them, they are also going to have a answer that they don't have all their housework and therefore not all their househomework and cutter.
And they have right. It's important life questions.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just that technology to work. Carl gave every day of every day of every day -- indecided to work.
There's a single place, which I mean, where WiFi the go.
I didn't have work, because I want to keep the myself.
But anyway, that huge choice of work in that we are work in that we are going to work and questions, or we go and questions, or not.
We can look at a footbalwish of our sion of the six of our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all coming from standing every minute, every minute, every minute, "Well, I ask this phone of the phone case of this phone casion?
As I write this e-mailt your letter? Well, I writer?
And even if the answer is "Ne" we experience the footbalso, the footbalsy of our son a very different way.
What we look at the big, the group, the small, materialistic bags, life is a choice of choose.
And the world there was early looking at the world there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a choice of choices.
And so the world are now looking at the world now there.
The question is now. Is this good or bad or bad or bad.
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what we know is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it.
That huge choician, two effects, two negative effects on the human.
A very hone-fect is that the first age, it's beyond anything works than completely --
And so many choice possible, people find the choice to make a choice to make a choice of choice as much choice as much choice as much choice as much choice possible.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigutions in free pensists in free pensions.
A collegs of me had been access to invest data of Vanguard, a big policy -- a big policy society of a million decorning of 2,000 few million 2,000 feeds.
And they discovered that for every 10 policy fundressing the works, the particular two percent defire.
And in five fundred 10 percent decided to be fundress works, within five fundres?
Because it in fundress fundress the choice is so last, people are just exciting the next day, and so on.
And of the basically comes discus.
That doesn't just mean, that people have after their pensioned not dream dream because they didn't have enough money and the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of that have been working for them.
And they song the same time, they salize of the year of their nose to go to the neus to go to through the nose of this.
The worknamely was capability to doubled their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contributed their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribution.
So a lot of choiciance can work on the lamorder.
And I think the world there's so from there.
If it ewigness to the ewign, you want to be very much the right choice?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong with the wrong driving fundressing thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the result of us and did the lost of us and choose and choose choices and did tevel less tears of the result of the case of the case of the case of us had been less options as we had less options and the case of us and choose the case of us and choose the decision of
There's a reasons of reasons for it.
One of the choice, for example, for example, and resources, back and resources the choice was not perfect perfect was perfect perfect
You stral you in a case for that another choice would be better.
This refled alternative shes that you can get to you spend from your choice.
And does break on the environment, and the following of the choice that you have made a good choice was a good choice of choice and the follow.
The more options of the course, and easier to have the speak of ineight eight each easy of the course.
A second reason of doing substitutives.
And then Gilbert gave from morning of the morning of things we depended the value of things we depended them.
If you can invitual alternatives and you can already all the actives of all the alternations that you walk to all the alternatives that you walk in the entire alternatives that you walk to all the alternatives of all the alternations of all the alternatives of all the alternatives of all the alternations of all the alternatives of the alternatives of
That makes you have less tevel with the alternative that you have choses.
An example. An the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is one of this example, the stretches of this example.
This is a bunch of vailable in the Hamptons.
They have a dress-second windown a home second windown.
They are a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No humans in sight.
Because can't do it? "Fordikt" that man, "It's augggor.
Everybody in my neighborhole in Manhattan is the city of the city in my neighborhol.
I would came my car flat the door, I could parker."
And he sit there is two weeks simply simply day and every day parking a great parking place mission of the idea of moment.
Substitutions are going to go to the cost of the entire we going to have of our choice that we have a great choice of our choice makes
And the more possibilities there are more possible alternatives are there.
And those presentation of us as substitutives.
Another example.
This pictures that you are going to set a number of points.
Life in the here, and you don't have to do things to continue and you don't have to do things
Another thing is that you have a point of the choices of choices of the choices of the choices of other choices of choices of other choice and a point of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choices of the cup.
And all that other has so be so much of the coses, which is the coocoses.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this thing, my search of my search to a new broed.
I almost always speak always and I was browing brow.
Because the one, there was one kind of speak and that cost your dan. It was not a bit of the page, it doesn't put the broek of the broek long enough and often the broek of enough and often enough, the corn, the right OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new week.
I said, "Dag, I want to say, "Dag, this is my meate."
And the really, the refit is fit or clear, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to said, "Wilt you smart fit or relaxed fit or relax
While you or a rity? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed.
Do you have a broak with sist effect?
Wilt you something extend to be a bit of pipipants." And so he went down and so he went down.
I was talking about it. I was talking about it. I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to the only broke that there was ear."
He didn't have idea that was and so I have a hour, and so I have a hour-edge all the possible.
And, I mean, I small the wink of the windown with a expended benefited passing pass of pass pass the brow.
I had better done better that I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To this is me, I wrommself to explain I wrote a book called a book called a book called a book called a book called this book of myself from this to myself.
The reason I didn't feel better felt with all that choiced, I was more fast, I started to expect a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of the fast.
I started without any expectation, because I just knew one.
And then turned out there was different and one of the fact of the perfect.
What I was cost of course, but not perfect.
And so I was my broed, I was my broed, and I mean, and that staled me me.
The more possibleility people have been expectations of the services of those possible.
And that means are less teeth, with results are results of results are results of results are being
Marketings don't know this thing.
Because in that case I don't know what I talk about now.
In the really case it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad people had pretty surprising experiences are surprising experience.
In our modern society of citizens we can accumber as well as we can act it best what we can act is so good as we could achieve it is so good as we had expected to be expected to be expects.
Never we are surprising surprise, because our expections of expection, my purpossible to be expectation.
The secret of happiness -- this is the secret -- the secret of happiness is not too much fortune to expect a lot of happiness.
I want to be here -- I want to be a car biographic elemental elemental -- I am with a woman who really fantastic fantastic is fantastic fantastic --
I didn't have a lot of tevaccumber straight with her teving.
But with less enough, with less enough,
And finally, you know, When you take a bad seat, you know, the bad as one kind of field as one kind of front is one kind of fair, you can ask you why you won't decet.
The answer is in that case,
The world is responsible ase. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy a responsible that is to fall that happens to fall of fall, who is the responsible of different bresponsible of different broed?
The answer is just so simple. That's so simple. That's so simple.
You had a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broed, you don't have excusion to faile.
So if people decisions are names, even as the results of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves and themselves themselves and themselves themselves themselves themselves and themselves themselves and they are themselves themselves themselves themselves and themselves themselves.
In the Western society of clinical depression of the young generations of the young generations of the young generations.
An factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor of this explosion of depression and self-moord, is that people so often our own curvatory of their experiences of their high experiences.
And if they try that television itself to explain themselves themselves the descipe itself.
So the netoresultain is that we have objective and the bad of gate, but our bad our corn.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, which is everybody for everybody to be currents.
But that's not the same thing.
It doesn't be choice that can choose better than not choice, but it's not automatically cous is not automatically better.
There's a magic fires of choice possible.
But I know that we have all the time, we have been previous that choice is that choicians are before.
Now there's a principle -- I am almost a principle -- a principle where we can like the best of us to do it.
The choice in industrialized countries coming from material overfish of material overfish --
There's a lot of places on the world, we have heard all over the problem is that there is a lot of choice is to much choice is to a few choice is to a few choice.
The paradox I talk to the case of the moderneat, wheelvaring West.
That's frustrated, and I mean, Steve Levitt you, and I told that dure and showing and children's frustrating and sales don't help it.
I say the same thing, the same choice -- they don't help the same choices -- they didn't help them showing it.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of the people in our society of those people who have been contributed to countries that people have been options of those people who have been doing to it.
And our lives of the lives of this.
That's what economists a Pareto-improving.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wheels -- and that comes around the last of choice that we have been coming with us.
At closing this. If you read this image read this image humans say, "Ach, what do you know is far as a developed humans say, "Ach, what does that far far and
Nothing is possible."
A school imagination, a short-like global world -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, I did to better I understand that this fish is desible.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you are the fish to create possible, you don't have freedom, but you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom, but sloss of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish to create possible.
If you are the fish to create possible, you get your less teving.
It leads to more lost and less tevactivity and less teving.
Everybody has to be a fish of course.
This is free certainly certainly -- possible, but certainly for us.
But the discipe of a figured figured to ask sure is asasking about, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
