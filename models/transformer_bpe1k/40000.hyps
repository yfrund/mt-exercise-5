And I showed these two slides to show that the pollut of the pollut capture that the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is a bit of the most production of this specific problem because it doesn't show.
The ice close climate system. And in a way, in a sense of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crack in the summer.
The next slide that I'll show is a version of what was happening the last 25 years happened in 25 years of what was happening in the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years of what was happened in the next slide of what was happening is a very much more accelerate version of what was happening is a version of what was happening is happening is a very much more accelerated in the nex
The permanent ice of ice is clearned in red.
As you can see, it sat out of dark blue.
That's the year, it's the equivalent in the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
And it called the permanent ice, five years or older is almost like blood, is almost like the body, that squekly here.
In 25 years is this to this to this called in the way to this form.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icel, and it was a very great amount of frozen cality there, when it comes to frozen carbon methan, when it death in methane.
And the result of the total amount of reach the atmosphere, that could double the amount of the atmosphere, if we write the closing point of the atmosphere.
In some understanding in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey went to Katey Walter of the University of Alaska at another team to another team to another team to another team of me.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is really if we will be able to be that we will be able to be the question is really going to be the question is really going to be the same though.
And a reason for that, is that this huge warmte, is that this enormous "warmtextype called warming.
This is a smooth of smooth.
The water volume is bigger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua's South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because it's land-fairly melt, this is the place where it is in the sea.
These streams are taking flightly down.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the south mass on Earth.
And the last month, scientists scientists that all the continent now a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice in the west, of the South Pole very quickly to the melt of the southern ise single of waters.
The whole continent is six meters for six meter, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after massa, there are now new now that were now a few years ago, which was a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water from that melt water of that melt at the melt time.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also dwines the drinking water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snowwish of the Sierra.
It's coming in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dream has led to a dramatic stycle of forest fire.
And the number of nature, of rams around the world is called an incredible and never seen fastonish.
Four time in the last 30 years of the last 30 years in the front of 75 years.
This pattern is completely unchildly.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 to CO2 aith, every 24 hours ...
25 miles every day in our oceans, whatever in the eastal area of Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drift of oxygen in the oceans.
The only major causing warming of the Earth, nast, nast, which is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and crosses, and it's all the most problem.
The United States is one of the two largest chains, sings with China.
And there was a pretty to build much more calls centers.
But we see a reverse --
These are the voice carbon cales that the building was annule, in the last few years and where green alternatives and where green alternatives were presentation.
There's a political battle on the country.
The steone carbon and oil, and oil industral gave last year 250 million dollars to promot clear to promote cle, which is a counter-fight?
And that picture to something that is thinking.
And the curst, at me at home in Tennessee, about four billion liters of four billion gallon-clean.
You probably have seen the news.
This is the one after a largest display in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the crowd of the cropped subject was the Kerstrial.
Video: "Frosty the crosty cleman is a happy to be a blice, guy's a moment.
It's overflension here in America, and he makes it makes our economy is that our economy.
Frosty the voice carbon guy is clean.
It's paid and cutile and cutting their job."
And here is a big coming from the voice in West Virginia from the voice in West Virginia from daan.
The largest mine worker, the great big, the great boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship Blankship -- "Let me clear. Al Gore, Nancy Red, they don't know what they have.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatence for our things.
That's the reason why it is our most important goal is to give a massive to the light to the light and the realm of truth and the realm of truth and the truth of truth of truth and the truth of truth of truth and the truth of truth and the reason why the poin
Fit is, step is not smartly.
We find that clean clean -- and it clean.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me just to us over.
Video: Acteur: Schone carbon critical citity.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean citical countral.
Fantastic! The machines are machines a little law.
But that's the sound of clean clean carbon technology.
And despite the fact that burning burning the fact of the nature of the Earth, changes the earth of the Earth, changes the remarkable counter, changes you see all here.
Look at around this is the clean urban carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that at the area of national security of national security of national security of national security of national security and that at the area of national challenges and that at the area of

The red wire wireless is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pollution and inported oil, as polluted oil.
But now there's a dure of course to get out of this.
And so, America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work America to work that makes us safe and the warming of the Earth counter.
And eventually a solution that is a solution that is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontill declic.
Al Gore: And the last one.

And one of the fastest ways to make a end of the fastest of old to our dependence, view that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, san, a new energy system.
And then we get investment to create good paid to create good pay good pay of the jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speak that says, "If you want to be a fast.
If you want to go and get together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave an introduced an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am it. For those of you who didn't have the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever supply in the case of scientification.
It needs to the conditions that were necessary less than a billion than a billion after the universe started to 600 million times a second of second.
Enorm ambitiously, so,
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors -- it's the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector, 22 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And at 10 September last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That made a party care in the controllection room.
It's a picture of the first particle that all the way around the LHC and photograph of the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture picture at 10 September we had that the machine worked, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this was the largest of the resource, or this, or then, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page, and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have made a cultural as a scientific impact.
And we had a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden wish.
Those driving 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power on full power to the full force
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too little dram."
They can do that because they can do is superceive on all the low temperature of temperaturs.
So at multiple of 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, who can remove between the stars, who can remove power to the galaxy.
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And then it was something warmer, and it was something warmer, and there was a electrical resistance that 13 thousand amper course,
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons of away that they were about 30 centimeters in the way of realize that have been moved in the way of move.
We declassed about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have tool,
Now they are back to road.
Eincluding the LHC will be again.
We will react it again, and we expect measurements in June or June so we can go further to figure out what the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe to the universe to the build of the universe to be the construct to be further again and expect it to be the conbuilding.
Now, of course, that have started increasing the debate of the value of science, and it's easy to research a value. It's easy to research of the value.
I think it's so hard to be so hard is that it's so hard to be further than ever beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I mean, the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did in the world of the valuable experiments of his teaching experiments of his teaching was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous decling the progress than the subject of human mind to take the human mind of the science, that there are no matter in natural developing in the natural of the define -- and that are completely that our experiments are not necess."
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask to you back to your childhood to your childhood at your childhood at your childhood together.
When you found to discovered how to grain and they were package, and you know, you actually have problems to solve with the define by the realize with and dealing with space and dealing space and defairly relationships.
Rumble insight, because of understand the understand of the world to understand us.
If an information inspired by the nof physical interaction with objects -- so, together with objects -- so, I started to ask with my advisore Pattion and my fellow -- what if we were a computer -- what if we were a computer to use a computer instead of a make, instead of using a kind of digital fingeral fingerences to a plate, which individe, which is information to a place count information that we can information that we can unders informer information that we can indid the information in the grastand,
and then orders as we want?
This question of this question that we decided to search a answer to search for Siftables.
Corly, a Sift is a Sift a interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be moved, and they can be moved, they can feel any movement and they can contact a screen and they can contact a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trades can be moved by understanding to understand through it can be moved by understand the core of the core understanding is the physical understanding is the physical corn, they can be moved by the physical core and the core understanding understanding the classember unction.
And so the top, Sift that Sift an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulate of digital information.
Because these tools have a more physical different of the movement and even of their movement and even of the way we movement and even though, and even of the way we move, there are different new and fun interactions and fun interactions and fun.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sift is institured to show a video is to show you play and plays, and others and others and played and played to the back of the value.
These interactive portraits are consciousness.
And they will be interested in each other, they will interest.
If they get surround, they can also do this and can be able to be some senuway.
And she feeling and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of the interesting consequences of the interesting of any gest, as it was a color as it was a fluid as a color as it was a fluid --
In this example three Sift drive Sift emmersive and I can use them to use color in a leaving in a leaving in a leaving in a leaving in a leaving to be college.
If we have drive, we put some back.
There are some of the clear capable of education, mainly capable to education, mathematics and logics where people want to provide people to prove things fast, and the result to see things fast.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programatic ship.
And here we show you a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every raround a present letter on every Sift on every Siftable, and few few dangered in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is being a new series of being a new series of letters with a new series of letters with a new series of opportunity.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I low them to make it out to make it out to make it out and make a video of it.
They were really road away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost nearly needs to instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our younggest base tester, right?
And it seems that he just seems the Sift of Sift that you have a clean.
For him was just this blocks.
Here is an interactive painting shown before.
We wanted to learning a platform for language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Sift with that characters of the table.
He let me come up with the sun here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done than! Yeah!
By shift Sift of Sift to each other, he can reach the characters to reach other, Wealy, Wely.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decision of how it distrikes the divide.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example that I'll show to show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recent sound every Sift that every Sift produces and drum.
Englor, four different variations, where you can choose which you can choose which you want to use it.
And this sounds in Sift in Sift of legal Sift so you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the attimes, and there's live controlled live controlled to filter.
They're being a sound and advanced and advanced by side.
And so, the general effects like tempo and volume that are being applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Sift in two Siftables, to a losed pattern by an extra lead.
Now I'm going to put the basline here.
Video: DM: Now I feed some slaggwork.
Video: And now I can buy the filter to the filter to the drums, so I can influence.
Video: I can accelerately accelerated by the obal blocky.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter to the filter to the base for what more expression.
Video: I can re-re-hold the pattern while it plays.
So I don't need to anything anything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And at the end, the dims of the whole through the volume Sift to the volume Sift to the left solid to the whole of the volume Sift of the whole of the volume Sift of the volume of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole is through the volume of the whole through
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of making new people, to make new people, interfaces that have been still better interfaces that better interfaces in the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of design area of possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring is that this is just the touch is that this is just a new generation to interact with digital media, which are the information to the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much of heart.
I look at it to you all to talk to you all and talk to you all it.
I'm writing writing.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My entire life long I'm going to be writing and I don't think that ever will change it.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career in my life and career to be a career to be reinded my work again.
It started a book that I wrote understanding a memoire, a memoire, "Eten, Biddy, very opposed to my earlier work and an international picture.
The result is that people all all over me and always to me, and always if I had to be down to me.
And what -- you know, doing -- it's doom!
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask it is never bang you can never be event?
Don't you any afraid you will keep your whole life write write is going to be a book, where people will be walking for warm to be walk?
If you don't have a bang through that?"
And you know, reasons, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be a smell that I was a teenager, when a teenager, a teenager, when I was a teenager.
People said, "Don't you get afraid you never get succcess?
Don't you know, you know, you don't get to the funning through it seems to be able to figure out of it?
Don't you any your life to this work without of this work without that there ever something out of the public and you will die. And you will die. And you will die.
Something in that stretch.
And in the short comes to the answer to this questions of this questions to this questions of course,
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called
Always the time.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you don't know what to do.
For seawe, for example, and other entirely things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that comes from, where that is fear.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is afraid to be afraid to the work that they put to their opinion on on Earth are making on the Earth is the work of that might be fright?
What is so particular to creative processes that we made us to make the effects of it on the effects of this is what happens in the minds, something like this.
Take my father. He was a chemistry, and I can't remember that there was any in 40 years that he was asked in 40 years that he has asked him to him or he didn't get afraid to him.
And that's what it said, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so it wasn't work about it.
To be fair to be fair fair through the centuries have been doing the reputation of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
And so, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputting mental instable to be instable.
Look at the grimy death of the most magnificant creative minds of the most magnificant creative minds of the 20th century.
And many of you have a lot of young, often by self-in.
And even those of you who don't have suicide of suicide under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under their gave under to be suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a lot of what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of except that we don't look more up.
We've all heard it before and have heard and solid it all before.
The heard of thought is that creativity is that creativity is inconnected to suffering an artist, and that will be a artist, and that will lead to a very benefit to a bit of a suffering.
And so I want to anybody to ask today to ask with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I agreed, I think about it now I think about not pretty the thought of thought
I think the refrach of the refrace.
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see that this century is that this century.
We can creative spirit much better to live better to live behind to live better.
I know that it was to me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark thought to live to the dark of thought life.
Sean, the phase where my career now in which my career now is now
One is young, I'm young, amper retic ah.
I can be able to work four decade.
And highest probably will be anything I've got to be a publise world as the work that is extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can slap you know: highest success, my greatest success of behind me.
Yes, what a idea!
If you go to think, you're going to be the morning to be nine hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work where I love.
The question is: "Hoo?"
After long time I come to think of the conclusion that I can only go by writing a psychological protect in the process.
I have to write a safe distance a safe distance between myself and my overwhat's very understand my considered to the reactions in my future publish.
I've been looking at the last year to ways to ways to do.
I did in history and have found me and have found in other societies to see if others have found a better way to see creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quartery questions, me has brought to the old Greeds.
And so, you because it's a long and complicated and complicated
In the old Great old and Romeins and Romeins people didn't believe that creativity was from itself.
And people believed that creativity was a good mind was a good mind of a moved across and unknowledge place and unknowledable reasons.
The Great called this demonstrengy of creativity called "demonmonen."
And so, Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that he influenced.
The Romeins had a species of a species of idea.
And they were called a geniused to be a geniused a genius,
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius,
In their political entities was a kind of magic entity entity that was in the walls of the walls of the artist state.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artist of the work was work, the genius,
And he gave shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier, the psychological protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew what that is in his work.
The artist was so in protection to the artism.
If you got a billiant was, you couldn't all the early eagain.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible genius that you had holpe.
Worly, you know, you know, it doesn't just read that not only you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time is that fellow in the West, the way in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There is a whole new idea: the individual human is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attackay, from the dival world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came from the individual.
And for the first time in history was saying about artists artists that they were a genius, and they didn't have a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a great wrong time.
And to one person to one person, one person to believe that he or she's fattle, the source, the source of ewonderful mystery, of all of the century mystery, of all of dividly, creative and known the famous human psyche.
And as if you ask somebody asks the sun in sun a sun
Egos are being blowing up to gigantic proportions and there are unimaginable highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly highly called the highly expectations and there are unimaginable to the gigantic proportic proportions and there are incredible highly highly highly h
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists has made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back to an older the understanding of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the influding of the relationship of the relationship be
Maybe not.
Well we can do 500 years we can do not make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably sat in the audience people who have reached the scientific doubt about the idea that elphysics of any put in feedings of the feedle to inspiration priviles.
It doesn't seem to get you all to get you to get you to get you all in there.
And yet I wonder it to me.
Why not?
Why would we didn't we have that thought to follow the thought of this?
It cutting as much as much as all the other explanations of the total inactability that decided to courageous uncomputability to create process.
And everybody who have a little bit of a has trying to create something -- so in fact, so all the presentation here -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process to be drive.
That sometimes almost paranormal.
I have recently, unning the great American closer Ruth Stone Stone of the great American close of amazing the great American closer close close of the great American close close of the great American close close of great American close close of the amazing American close c
She's close in the nine. And she write all of life all writing them.
She told me her youth on the platounds of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was work, she felt a poem close of them a poem on the country.
It was so said, she said, she also said, she was a major came up with the air of air came along with it.
And so a poem golf than the country to her the country to her her.
She felt that the ground, she felt started shaking her feet, and it knew that her at that point to do one thing that is stood for her life.
She was ran home, back through the poem and she had to see so quickly possible and see paper and see piece.
When the poem close close was that her only came her to write it was her only to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't fast force.
Then run, but run, now, but now, not, nothing running and running not.
And in the moments her hold close by her her -- in fact, in fact, search -- in fact, in fact, in fact, in a different closer -- to another close -- to another close -- in a different closer -- in fact, in fact, in fact, search -- in fact, in a search -- in fact, in fact, in fact, in a different close -- in fact, in fact, in fact,
And it was also much of them -- I think -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost mistake.
Then she was looking for the house and paper and paper and pieces of poem through her it.
Juist at that potal had she had a potom.
And with her other hand, she told me she plucked the poem from the air.
She picked up with his tail, and pully, and pulled back to her body, while she wrote the right.
And in that cases came the close close of close in a lot of paper and all the piece of paper -- but then in the follow.
When I heard that thought, I thought -- what happens to be a creative process of course,
And this is what my creative process is not a medium medium
I'm a mile, which is a mice that every day on the same time standing with blood, sweating and sweats with blood, sweating and sweats through the same through and sweat.
But even in that day swell, I had one such a experience that experience.
You can also know it will also know that feeling that feeling that feeling that there are creative ideas in your board from a source that you can can identify you can identify in the sources.
What is that sources for source?
How can we use it without that we have become crazy to be used to use the without of that?
On a way that we have good for us to be a good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musician example Tom Waits.
And I interview a few years ago, I interview him for a magazine
We had the way to do it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life had been showed the showed of the crimble of the crims that try to get to the unfortable creative impactable creative impulses that reviews in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit was a smooth.
And one day he read in Los Angeles on the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he got so got this fragmental of a melodia.
It decided to him, like inspiration that does does it does -- understand the wish.
It was a beautiful nice and he wanted to hold it the hold of the hold.
But it wasn't that way.
He had no paper -- no paper -- no taperecore at itself.
The well-familiar excition was again, "I went to the melody and then makes me ever equivalent to me, and then it turns to me.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it anyth."
He didn't real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he looked up, and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the stuff and sat the sky and said, "Sorry hear,
"Do you really know that I can be a song you a song you on a song of you can write a song you in a song of you can be a song you to be a song you to be a song that I can be crosses?
And if you really want to get that this song is to close another one of you have to close another one of you have to be a lot of time.
Now, not, somebody else is going to fall.
Go neighborhensive at Leonard Cohensive the process of the process of very different.
The work is a little bit of the same thing with the famous subject.
But the heavy excition that creative process in him called the creative process of geniused to the enjoy;
The genius was to close to the skin, and just made it alone.
Tom realized that there was no realized to realize through it.
It could be a wonderful, bizarre cooperation between a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner did that not quite at all.
That story that has changed my way of work changed.
I've already have been a profoundly
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle in the writing process of Eten, Biddle in the writing process of Eten, Biddle.
And at a given moment I put in a space in despair.
You know that well: you want to be a good and you don't think it's a terrible disaster to a terrible disast. The worst book.
Not six of bad, really horrible horrible of this.
I wanted to get the whole project all the project of the project
And then I remember Tom those who was to be a whole wish, and I decided to be a point to be a point
I wish my manuscric, and I founded to a leave to a leave core camberately of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know everyboth is that if this is not just comes to be both through me.
You can see that I have in the stop in the basic I have in me.
I can't give you any it.
If you find that it must be better than you have to come to do.
Do you don't have that, until you not, right?
I just write through because that's a now my work.
Oh, and in the noty is going to be disagree that you have a lot of the office of the office of the office of the office --
Tja--- United it comes up here on the down here,
Eured in the North African desert African desert people to dance in the sact of music to dance in the sacres of music to sacres on sacre.
And at the chards, to the challenges to the morning,
That was always great, because the dancers were full professionals.
But sometime, sometimes very happened to be something extraordinary happened.
One of those dancers became then transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever seen anything like a performer.
It was as if the time standing stood and the dancing through a path.
He nothing else than the thousands of nights for thousands of all together.
And suddenly seemed to seemed a human being.
In him, under him, under him, under him is a light of it.
A fired fire, through him.
And if you did something like this, they were going to be Dan they started clapped to clapped and in cost, Allah, "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical fact, whate: Too the Moren Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Span
The question is real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, OK, oy."
That hort you today to died the day at fight, and flamengodance.
If a pactist in Spanish or magical does, "Allah, Allah, "Allah, Allah, ful, brok."
Sipul, so: a glimpse of God.
People what we need.
And lamong is that the dancer that the following morning to the next morning that he discovered on the morning in the morning of the morning,
And at that moment is he again, a little older guy with declusion will never come to such a few highly ever to such a lot of the height.
Maybe never going to be anymore anybody God to have any more somebody God to be a dance.
What to the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to square to show for a creative mine.
But it doesn't need to be it doesn't be to be the way.
And imagine that you don't get out of the most inusion of your person aspects of your person to yourself.
And imagine you believe them a while time you have a while, a while of a didn't nader a source.
When you're ready ready to somebody else they're given to somebody else.
That's what is is the way to be a lot of it.
I high inside that thought of thought to it.
The last months I've been working on a book, which is going to be a book, which is going to be a lot of reaching in a long time to be looked at a long time to be looking at the time.
The conference of that illustrates in the way of fored.
And if my thought to me, I keep the same thing that I love to the same form of the same thing that doesn't be any anyway.
That's just your work.
And just the way you do this, what it is.
If you can task you very much for your task is to dance.
If the good genius that you have been decision to decision to your work at a sources of the wonderful sources by lating to the wonderful source, "Ol.
Then not, dance dance then, thance of thance
And so, than: "OK!"
I believe that I believe that heart.
"Ole !" anyway, because we pure out of human love and wisdom, and yet own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole !
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and discovered and figure out of new sets of sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were a new point: we were the biology to the digital code to a new fase in the biology to a new phase in biology, with the designing and synthetic designing of life.
So we've tried always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is like, what I think is something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand on different levels at different level.
We tried different approach to minize the minize of minimagined components.
We're now going to be the digitization.
When we have sequenced the human genome sequence, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask in the way we can regenerate life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium for a species that can be multiplicate in a laboratory in a laboratory --
And we tried to look at a none, if we can get a smaller genome.
We can go out of hundred genes from the 500 or anything like throw that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that very simple compared to the oney.
And it's easy to me, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can look at piece of the genes that we can probably exumble that this would be a living cell of cell cell that would be a living cell of a life cell of the genes that we can probably get a living couple of cell that we can probably be a likely to be a likely to be a likely to be
We decided that the only route prevalue to this chromosome, so that we could be able to synthetic so that we could be able to ask the components to ask the components to ask the any of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started to ask questions as a chromosome, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we start a chromosome,
And the chemistry the chemistry the major molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome, a chromosome,
And a chromosome, by the way, by the way, but a piece of chemical iners material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitize of life is accelerating on exponential well.
Our power to write the genetic code, but is a pretty slowly slowly, but is a lot of slowly, but is a lot of slowly slowly slow of the genetic code.
And our last point would be the exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago,
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethical tsing too,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make, the more more you know, the more mistakes of it.
So we had to put a new method to the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the wrong pieces and corning all the wrong.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, we did the wrong correction --
and DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we put a piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria code genetic code and viral code, and viral particles went to make virture.
The viral particles were called the cells, they came back from the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was incentivated with the oil industry and I said that snapprimary and I said that snapprimary model for a long thing.
They laughing more than you.
And so we think this is why we think this is a situation where the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to something much bigger.
We wanted to build the ential bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could viruse, so we could variety the cassettes --
to understand what the ched's actually components of a living cellents of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that it has to be very accurams to be very accurazy.
When we first cure to the first time in 1995, the standard in 1995, the standard of a per 10,000 baseparates.
And finally we found after a resequencing 30 wrong couple of the original sequence of the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that are longs that have to read with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so doing so that they can design so they can design so they can be able to design so they can get so that they can be able to design so that they can go so that they can go to and build so that they can go to build so that they can be able to be able to de
We designing in the unique of the unique of the unique of the unique of the unique of the unique of the unique of the subjects in the same parts of the unique of the subject of the unique of the unique of the unique of parts are unique in the parts of the unique parts of the parts of the unique of the uniqu
Maybe you have read to have read water notes in stop.
There is this: we have a squartery genetic code: A, C, C, Gently and T.
Trios of those letters crise for the roughout 20 aminos -- that there is a mean, there's a long attacks.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
And at signed a sign, we only called me.
Some had been counters were calling that there were no poems were directly
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repairs and in each other.
And we started making pieces of them start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters of five to 7,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, until 72,000 letters, to 72,000.
And in every stadium we could get a fluence of these pieces of pieces because we want to create them because we want to create a process that is very robuilt -- that will be very robuilt -- that will see being a tribe.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as soon as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow in E. coli.
That's going to be the except of all the modern of the molecular biology.
So we went to raismed with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists is called "homology to repairs by the biology to repave to DNA to repair and pieces together.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococococcus radiodurance that three million radiation to radiation to radiation in the radiodor raws of radiodurance to radiodurance of radiodurance called Deinococcus radiodurance called Deinocus radiodurance that three million
And you can see in the top panel, she sex a chromosome, you can see a chromosome,
12 hours later 12 hours later he was in the weather, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be this.
These organisms can completely dried up to be a lot of thream
They can be in a vacuum lives.
I know absolutely certainly that there can be a new aquatic exist, that can find move, a new aquatical environment.
NASA has shows show that there is a lot of it, there's a lot of it, there.
Here's a real micropicture of the molecule that we've made with these processes -- actually used to just yesterday -- actually yesterday mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did.
And it makes it makes them automatically together.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we instead of inside the publish.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The moleculeculecule, more than 300 million
If we would pressure with a 10-points letter, without spations, there's 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code.
All right, how do we start a chromosome? How do we activate?
With a virus is a clearly easy.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you put under eukaryots, like we just give the cell in and doing another in, and that's what you know if you clothese, and that's what you know if it clong, and that's what you know if it clong.
And in the bacteria species of integrated in the cell in the cel, but we have shown in the cell transplantation of a chromosome, and we can activate a chromosome, and can activate it a chromosome.
We have a chromosome. We have a chromosome.
These are about so far as far as far as people and mously away as people and mously mously
We feed some extra little extra genes so we could select for this chromosome.
We have the defenced with enzymes to make all the protein of proteins to make all proteins
It was quite sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosomes -- the new chromosome, in the new chromosome.
We even thought that he would be just to square to develop the process of developing what further to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We figured all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a third somewhere they have third properties in one times in one times in one times in one times in one times in the species.
People who proposed evolution evolution to the same time have changed a lot of biology have been called biology.
There are enzymember restriction enzymes that are really called DNA fairly enzymes DNA
The chromosome, in the cell that was doesn't ever eat.
The cell -- the chromosome, the chromosome.
It was extended to exact the other chromosome, and the other chromosome, and it was a strange of the new chromosome, and we finally had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared, all the characteristics of one species, and ship it in the new species, and software that we stop in the new species, and software that we stopped in the cell we stop.
All proteins changed the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code, the genetic code, the exactly in the genetic code.
This is makes like genomical alchemistry as genomic, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
All right, I've been paid before this is not a creation -- this is a lot of the Camborn -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I paid that we may be a new version of the Cambrical scale that may be a new species where there are massive new species of scale, where there are massive in this digital design.
Why would you do this this?
And I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to be a half to a billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet,
for each of us that in 1940 years that in 1940 years that will be four years that there are four in 1940 years that will be four in 1940 years that will be four that there is four that will be four that there is four that will be four that there will be four that there are four in 1940 years that will be four in 1940 years that will be four in 1940 years that will be four that there are four in 1940 years that we lived in 1940 years of us that there are four that there are four that we lived in
We have a lot of corporate with food, with clean water, drugs, fuel cine, fuel of a billion and a half billion.
That's getting difficult to do that for nine --
We use five billion tons of collision, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 miloes a day.
When we take biological processes in any single or any any process than any process to replace that; then it's going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is of course that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere of the atmosphere is coming in
And through our global discoveries that we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been doing the electronics had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of that.
We're mainly limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got technique to do this rap, thank of this called combination called combination genomics to do as a combination genomics to do a combination general synthesia.
We've got the possibility to build a million chrobot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put on the story of 20 million different genes of genes or produces to produce octan, we can produce to produce octan, new vaccines, new vaccines, we can change with a little team molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's only standard of the selection.
We can select select for life vatability to live production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design is a design software where we work to the access and a new species on the computer can design a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will be a person is going to see here.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code.
We focus on the fourth generation.
And you have seen grain to ethanol you seen a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come from inside fuel like sugar, to more highly like sugar, to more highly like octan, to more highly species like octanol.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have great influence without the food price and making the food price and the available of available and the available of food, and we think that we do the first food cells that we do it in that way in that way in that way, and we think that we do the first fires in about 18 months of the first fires in about 18 months of fields in about 18 months of fixes.
Slight and CO2 is method -- -- but by our global discovery -- we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 196.
It lives in the deepsea half miles deep, at calculated temperature of salive.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to factory fabried to fabried out to fuel this process.
So in a short time we think we are in a short of expansive to the basic question: What is life?"
We have a real induce of the purpose of the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED can do that, where anyway?
A important energy source is being a major energy source.
But we also use to use these tools to use these tools to think faster series of vaccines to think of these tools.
This year was the flu, we just walk up to the right time the facts of facts when it comes on the right vaccin.
I think that can change by making a combined vaccine.
And here you see how the future can go out of the future of evolution tree is going to change the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually evolution of evolukaryota.
We're still away from the improving people.
Our goal is to assure, we make a chance of a long enough to survive that maybe a long enough to do that makes you may be able to do that makes you may be a chance to survive that maybe a chance to survive that makes a long enough to survive that maybe a chance to survive a long enough to survi
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to be about a year ago. This is Sedragond about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can work local or on the immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at this here many gigabytes to digital images and can be seedless on the wish and makes and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much these collections or pictures are image.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapial reach.
It all does not make anything that because the only thing would be influence, on a subject in a system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image data.
This is the grauw house by Dickens. Every column, is a chapter.
To prove that it's really a text to be a picture, and not picture, we can do something like this is really a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of weird way to read a book.
I wouldn't reach it --
This is a realistic, this is an example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a subject of a subject
This is really gives you the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or capital corn, which is a scaling medium.
We also done something that we done with the corner of the excite of the Guardian.
We have a nep adversisising a higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising information -- and we have extra normal advertising information -- and we have extra normade of information -- much higher than a normal resolution -- much higher than a normal resolution -- much h
If you want to see the potential of this car you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it really really, we can really do the limitations of across the screen.
We hope this is not going to be a pop-ups more and other through flaudge -- not will need.
Of course, of course, a for the hand maps for a technology like this, I will not spend a time to spend a time to this field, except that we can contribute a lot of contribute to this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And place on top of the NASA --
Now let's look at something else.
This is marries now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who connected two techniques with each other.
One is Seth is Seth is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Snavely, promote to the University of Washington, defails by Steve Seitz at U.W.
and Rick Smelliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful concerned together.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see that we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the images of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been consider these images to real space -- the Grassi Lakes in Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome. There are genomes of diashws of panormal diashws or panormal panormal panormal panormal and all these things.
I don't know sure or there's time there, other environments of time.
There are a lot of space there are much space.
I want to like to like a Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth, which is a early prototype of the environments -- to the communicate of the environments of the environments on our website of environments on our website of environments on our website.
We had to check with the advocate and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Now Dell Dell with images from Flickr. You search for Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus
And each of these orange pictures give you a picture that are part of this model.
And so this is all Flickr pickr pickr that are copped in this way space in this way space --
And we can be able to navigate in the simple way.
You know, I never thought I would ever work at Microsoft to Microsoft --
It's overwhelming here is so defairly to be so defairly in this way.
I believe you can see that this many types cameras are cameras to mirror cameras a good number of that, a major number of them.
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much more covered by factions and the simply
And anywhere between is a series of pictures -- here they have a series of pictures -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Now Delebrity that is also good-capital by the program.
If we suppose the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of all the gesture of the whole collective memory of the whole of the memory -- and copps that everything to each other.
All these pictures are being a lot of the pictures are a greater than the supply of the parts.
You have a model that from all around the Earth is the earth of the Earth is
And that as a second on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use, and which the benefits of the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being supply data that somebody else somebody else
When somebody would like to click all these sacks, and their names and their names and the equivalent of the Notre Dell Delements with all of that data, and I can use if a access to the metaphology that metaphold of each anyone of the cross-modal, and creating social social social social social social social social social social social social social of these of crace, and social social social social experience.
And of course, the member product of an immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth who don't only photographs, who don't only photographs, but also of the collectives of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all images that are part of the world that are particular in the world that are particular in the world can get together?
BA: Yes. What really does discovered.
It creates the wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the picture.
And that is getting exciting when you think about the richches of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look for the web looks for the web is to pictures, you can see a search of the piece of the piece of what the imagina lot of information about what the imagina result of what the image representation is a lot of information about what the imagina is that you can see the pictures, you can see a lot of information in the web, you can see a search for the piece of the piece of the pictures, and you give you a lot of information about what the piece of information about what the picture.
What if now that pictures is to all your imagination?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of the amount of wealthy that comes from that, and it's a classical networkfect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicity.
One of the intense pleasure of the intense of edits and research is the opportunity to live between them who are not forgetting their past, who feels are fell feeling in the wind, the reason for police policists, the profoundly in bitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky Way, or that the myths of Instead, or that the myths of Instead, or that in the Himalaya boodhist of dhist on the boodhist of Dharma, remember to the real realm of the anthropology of anthropology -- the world in a absolute of anthropology -- but it's a model of the world that we live, but is a model of the worse to a model.
the consequences of a set of a result set of choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all sharing the same tools of each equivale: Worly, Brength in the world.
We all do inition rites.
And so, you know, the individual separation by death,
So it can't be surprise, we all have sings, dance and art art.
But interesting is the unique of song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is to the Penan in the forest, or the Voo--acolliers in Haiti, or the fight-bators in the Kaisut-bars in North Kenya, the Carai in the Andes-ber Carai in the Carai in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the same through the desire by the corner of the cornine, a month, a month,
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learning us all that we can be think we can be thinking differently, our otherwise to be able to think of the Earth
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a hope on it.
And shapes the intelable cultures in the world, a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet and it's as important as the biosphere.
This cultural life web as a sweb as a eating eating eating a core of eating eat.
The eath face cool you can define when the total of all the thought of all the gets, mythes, mythes, mythes, and inspiations that are contination and intuitions that are the beginning of our human imagination is the beginning of our imagination is the beginning of our consciousness.
The cruster is the great legacy of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we can be and all of us and we can be amazing curious animal.
like the biosphere is a several shax is the eath fact that -- and in much greater matter.
No biologist would take a biologist that at least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of the species of extinction is not true.
And the right that is the most apocalyptic scenario comes in the neighborhood is the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of language.
And then everybody here was born of the same thousand languages of the Earth produced.
A language is more than her words or her gramatic regular regular regular regular regular regular to her gramatic regular is more than her gramatic regular to her gramatic regular to her gramatic regular is more than her gramatic regular regular than her her gramatic res.
A language is a cutting of human soul.
It's the vehicle of which is the soul of any unique culture the material world to reach.
Every language is a century forest forest wrong forest wrong -- a though, a discontect to spiritual possibility.
And of those sixes today is thousand language today of that doesn't fluence.
They're not going to be a longer babies.
Effective means that means a change that they are.
Is there something that is a lonely to be a close by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to have a chance of wisdoms by giving the children's rewards?
People that is somebody's legal state every two weeks of weeks on Earth, because every two weeks and with him the last letter-fairly and with him the last letter-fairly letter-fairly of an old language.
Some of you say, "Well, not the world world don't be better place if we all should speak all the same language, let's take the same language. Or Kantonees. Or K.
Or Kogi." You will realize you realize how it would be able to talk to your own language.
So what I really want to do today is to take you on a short trip by the eat, which is a picture of what is lost in fact, in fact, which is lost in fact,
And many of us forget that when I have to be talking about another way" I really mean, I really mean, I really mean, very different ways of being a different ways.
Take a child in the North west-Amazon, the people, the people, the people, the people, that believes that she believes of clocks, from the east, in the east, in the pace of snakes.

They have a fall of the language of regular rule, which is linguistic exogamy is called somebody who is a marrief a different language.
This has become in the mythological past, but the extraordinary full in their houses, where six or seven talk, by this cross-marriage, but you never heard anyone of the language of a language hears eagain.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinated tribes that I read lived with the Waorani in North Ecuador, a remain 1958 feathers contact in 1958 feathers.
In 1957 percent five missionarians contact to explain to be a critical fault.
And the air of the air currently powered to our idea's idea of themselves with the idea of that never seen a two-dimensional picture.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some question I recently, and I defavailable to be a book.
Maybe you see parallels to information from other sources of sources.
And I also try to explain some of the way that you may be mist.
I want to start to start to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows as follows the prospil of our neighbors on the highest level, we have to give them so much as much as possible freedom.
Freedom, is an agence, a essential part of the human existence.
And for totally to cut us freedom, to act a higher insight, to reach a higher professing a higher profession of this.
The ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically more freedom,
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take a one of the driving nobody would take on the society of the moment.
And in our life is this dogma cuma corn.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. It's a means a mediate.
And then about dressing.
And in that 175 can-five can-result dressings are in my supermarket virgin my supermarket and a different of extra-virginflerty and different balance.
And that you can make a number of dressings are dressings for the case of the case that 175 species for you.
So that's the primarket.
Look at electronics to electronics -- you can get your stereoset of stroneoset of cassettespecially -- cassettespecially diversity -- diverstergame and dio,
And in those electronics in the case of you can pick out of this is what you can choose out of this attack.
You can be six-en-half million systems together of systems with the parts of that shared.
Give towards -- then you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could call kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't wrently it on the state.
That had the advantage of it was never ever piece of the advancement.
That time is the time.
Today there are a lot of different state.
And especially in cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- which with mid-favorite player, and crer and crer crer and crer and crer and crer and crer crushed to the middle --
Well you have not seen this model in the store, but you can see that happens in the win, but you can be sure that is happens.
The result, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question of the answer to the answer to the answer --
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the point of the approach of choices is this explosive increase a few of choices a feis.
Gealthcare -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so you go to the doctor, and you know, you know, you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do A, we can do that.
And it's got this form and then this form and down this form and downase.
And it has this form and downase?"
And you say, "Doctter, what is finis?"
And the doctor, "A has this form and then this form and down to do this form and down to the doctor.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm noth."
And we call that "inbring inside of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means that the heavy that slight of decision of the decision of things -- the doctor, somebody who are free -- to a fairly sick and not the best condition to take the best condition to take decisions. For at recipatient. For at recial recipe means are made.
Good consider shows that ners anywhere you can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why we can't buy themselves them?
because they think we go to the next morning, our doctomorrow our doctorrow to ask that other branch.
And our identity, yet a brible aspect of us existence, now is now in the choices, as you can see on this slide.
And our identity is our identity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to be ourselves.
Every morning at the morning to be you think you need to be what for person you want to be what for person you want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that free that free everybody else that you can get out of the way that you can possible by the way, and then soon as quickly possible of children started children start.
The only real choice, not when and what you did and what you did didn't when you did and what you did doesn't when you did it.
Now is freely all for the room of the crap.
I give a particularly intelligent students, which I had a lot of designed less house than early early than early asked to the early through the corn.
They're not dom, in the higher or let me be in the waiting time.
No, they have the pressure with choices of choices
"Well, I marries or not? Well, I now marries now?
Or I will I wait for that? Now, I first children, or a career or a career re?"
These are all failure.
They are going to have an answer to them a answer to them down to get their homework, and they don't get a good number of number of number of number of number of the homework, and they don't get a good number of their homework, and they don't get a good num
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just given us that technology to work. Carl to work every day from every day -- except in the world, in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a marries one place, which I love secret where WiFi it does.
I don't value, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, those huge choices of work kept in that we won't go to whether we whether we're going to work on the right now.
We can look at a football competition of our son and we can look at one hand, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and we might be our laptop of school.
And even if they all out of standing, except every minute of that competition with all kinds of competition to answere, "Well, I have this phone callerge?
And I think about this emails respond to this emails respond to write through this letter?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience, we experience, we experience.
And what we look at it, the grand the small, the small, materialistic bases of lifestyle: life is a question of fool.
And so the world early looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or world or worse or worse --
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what is good to is, so I'm good, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about what is bad about what is bad to is.
Those huge choice has two effects, two negative effects on huge effects on huge effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negative effects, two negati
And a very counter-opposite is that the earlier is that the earlier than counter.
And with so much choices as much choices people find it difficult to make a choice.
I give you a whole dramatic example of investigation to investigation, a research planns.
A colleague of me got access to invest data of me got a Vanguard, a great policy society of investment in about 2,000 vestments.
She found that for every 10 percent to every 10 percent the worker boat, the particular two percent of the too.
In fifty fundress 10 percent less percent less than five five five on five founds. Why?
Because it to fiftill funds so difficult to choose the choice that people just touch the choice and so on. And that we just put up and so on.
And from extend to comes from the same thing.
That means that not only that people after their pensionate to eat the pensionate because they didn't have a dream because they didn't have any food, but also did that she was the worket that she was worket in the worker of them shoot in the work of together.
And they set up to that she walked to 5,000 dollars a year for a year for a year for a year.
The worker was called the case was called the contribute their own contribute to double.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice.
And I think the world of it.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right to make the right either you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundressed dressing.
That's the first effect. And the second effect is that we shake the paralyzing of our dishe's less sky, less sky, less teval, less sal, the result of the result of the result would be less options as we had less options as we had less the deal.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of them is that there is a choice, for example, in the way from tallow dressing the choice that the choice wasn't perfect.
You can put you in such a case for that another choice better.
This dream alternative alternative alternative to your choice of choice.
And does break on the full of choice that you made the choice that you made it was a good choice.
The more options of the more options of easier to have a spired of ungetting eight every eight every of the geckose option.
A second reason of doing with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave from morning, what we dependent to the value of things that we dependent them to compare.
If you can think of many alternatives in the attractive of all the alternatives of all alternatives that you can be awast.
That makes you have less slide with the alternative that you have chose to the alternative that you have chose to the alternative that you have chose less to the alternative that you have chose less to the alternative that you have chose less less to the alternative that you have chose less teves.
And a example. For non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example.
This is a pick in the Hamptons.
They have a little bit of wound.
They are in a wonderful beautiful beach. No human beautiful again.
Beet can't be anything, "Well, it's a caughty." think gust.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city is the city of the city of the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of the city is outside of the city is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of city in Manhattan is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of the city in Manhattan is the city of the city in my
I could flat my car for the door, I could parker."
And he is to simmultic two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking place a great parking place mislect.
Substitution costs are going to be the fairly of our choice, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there, the more attractives alternatives are there.
And those presents to us as substitution costs.
And another example.
This pictures to a number of points.
Life in the here and now and now you don't have to hate things.
And another thing is that you have to exclude with every choices of choices --
And all of that has been so much of the result, which is that the coose option is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this in my search for a new broek.
I always shing a spired to always a breaking.
And it was one of the way of secure was one species and that bought your mind. And it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the broed, but if you were the broek of the broek and often enough and often enough the right OK.
After I went to the store for a new new one.
I said, "That's my meag, I want to get a distrike, this is my me."
And the store said, "Will you fit easy smart or relaxed to relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Will you knotts, or ritic? Will you stone-washed?
Do you know a break with slide?
Will you might be a bit of pipe, or swall, or flating pipiped." And so he was just down.
I was spottouched from it. After a while I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only broek that was ear."
He had no idea which was that and so I was a long time and so I have a long all the possible broed.
And I was honest, I left the store of the win, with a bit of a breakable broek.
I had better done it better. And through all those possibilities I could do better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To about myself out of myself, I've wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice, was that I started expect to expect a good spired more of a good speaking more freedom.
I started without any expectation, because I just knowledge, and one species of the spire.
And then it turned out there was a different and one of them would be a fix.
And what I bought was a good thing I was good, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I mean, my break with my expectation, and that asked me me to the same typice.
The more people have to have more people to have the more people to have more expectations of the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevalue with results, even if the good results, even if good results.
Marketingle people don't know this thing.
because in that case, you know, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in really about it is about it.
And all was better when everything was better.
because when everything was bad of a bad experience, people could have experiences.
In our modern society of society as a citizens perfection to expect the best thing we can achieve ever of it.
Never we become a surprise, because our expectations, my expectation, the expectation, torently hight.
The secret of happiness -- this is not to expect -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much happiness --
I want to ask you -- you know, a car biographic elemental -- that I was married with a woman who really amazing fantastic is.
I didn't have me with her less texts,
But with less enough, you have a good side.
And finally, what's a bad speak a bad speak to the muscle of it as one species as one species is one species of the reason why you unteve.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, and you buy a lot of it turns to fall, who is the responsible is responsible to the responsible of different bit?
The answer to that, is just as simple. That's so simple.
You could make a better choice.

So the netoresulate is that we spoken on the objective of the fairly fellow but our bad of this.
And anything to say a continue to a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for what is to be touch.
But that's not the same thing --
It doesn't be a doubt that can choose better than not to choose is better than it is to choice, but it doesn't automatically better.
There's a magic boundary capabilities. Well, I don't know.
But I know that we have been a long time for the point that choice is that choice awful is produced.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep us the best thing we can keep us the best thing to keep us the best thing that we can keep us the best thing to keep us the best thing to keep us the best thing to keep the best thing that we can keep us the best thing to keep -- I'm almost of a prin
