And I showed this two slides to show that the police cap, that the past three million years of the last three million years of the U.S.
But this is actually the reason the second of this specific problem because it is not the disection.
The ice capack on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crackage.
The next slide of what's happening is a version of what's happening is happened 25 years.
The permanent ice is depended in the rood.
As you see it, sit looks at dark blue.
That's the yearal ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
It called the permanent ice, five years or older, five years or older, is almost like blood, that from the body,
In 25 years is the from this right now.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrate and there's a very great amount of frozen carbon crices and there's a very great amount of frozen carbon methane.
And we really, with the total higher remosphere, in the atmosphere, would double how to double point if we could describe describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe to description in the atmosphere, in the atmosphere.
In some uncertainly deep methane of the water.
At the last went down, Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another undeep more.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real or we will be wrong to be
A reason for that, is that this huge warmble "warm-bon" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver --
The water volume is bigger than ever ever bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerangerling is the Kangerest Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because the landics -- it's the place where it is the place where it is the sea.
These streams, they take them.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the south mass the greatest ice mass on Earth.
At a month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice in the West of the South Pole, very quickly fast, with some of the name throw several ears.
The whole continent six feet of six feet in six meter, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the one after the greatest ice of ice mass, there are new now, new now that was a few years ago,
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that smelt of that smelt of that smely water of that smelt of the world's population is getting the world's population is getting the world population is getting half of the global population is getting half of the global population is getting half of the global population is getting half of the mely clas
In the Andes, this glasses the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, disappears to the drinkwater.
In California was a freduction of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are nitutions that was in.
This global dreamed dreamed to dramatic stycle.
And the number of nature, around the world is cited with an incredible and never seemed to have an incredible fast.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the past 30 years.
This pattern is completely intential to be intention.
If you look at the pursue of a historic context than you can see what's happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 envirture.
25 miles every day in our oceans, Koose to ease the east, and the east, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drifive continent, there's a drify of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great caused to be the Earth, next to design from the Earth, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and voice is the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extincers, samps with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more strain.
But we see a cump of it.
These are the voices that the country was answed in the last centralized in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last year and were put it in the last year alternatives were put in the last years,
There's a political strizle to the country.
The voice carbon and oil industral gave in 250 million dollars to promot "sound" stones to promote a cleance.
And that image me to think about something like that.
And Rond the chargest of the home in Tennessee, about four billion liter billion liter chard of money modder belie.
You probably seen the news face.
This is the one after a greatest dependest dividual in America.
This is happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertise of the cities of the coop, was three around the Kerst.
Video: "Do the count coal-coolman is a blice, operated gue else, up.
He's flowing up in America, and he care in America, and he care that our economy growing the economy growing that our economy growing up in America, and he care in America, and he care in America, and he care going to square that our economy is growing in America, and he c
Frosty the voices of the counman is clear.
He's pay and cutily and cuttile and working."
Here is a big part of the voice in West Virginia from West Virginia from the city.
The greatest mine of the land is the great bigh of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship Blankship -- "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Redit."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate protection for the same campaign.
This is a piece of them.
Well, Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's the reason why the reason is to give us a gigantic age to give a gigantic and reason the light and the deployet.
Feit is not set is not smarkable.
We think it's soon clean -- and it room is still still clean,
So, you don't make a care about care about climate change.
Let me go to us over.
Video: Acteur: Schone chone of hearing heard of it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern city,
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of what disease.
But that's the sound of sound sound of song,
And despite the fact that the burn that burn burn of the earth causes of the earth is the remarkable causing of the Earth is remarkable to cite technology that you see here.
Look around the clean urrency technology of the cool technology of today.
Al Gore: Einvinally, the positive alternative alternative alternative with our economic challenges and the area of national security.
Video: America is in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire with all these things are our dependence is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pile colls, and inmported oil.
But now there is a during new solution to get this.
America 100 percent of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America work to work up with a plan that is a plan that our is down to the Earth is going to be securrents.
Eventually, a solution that is a solution that is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Onte.
Al Gore: And the last smooth.
Video: Stem: It's about America is rein-energy.
One of the fastest ways to make an end on our dependence of old, view of olded fuel that our planet.
Man: Here is the future of the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man early 2: New investment to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old Africans speak that say, "If you want to be able to do it is going to be going to be down.
If you want to go to go and go up with a far to you."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you.
And I was going to gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hope of how that works.
So here I am here. For those who didn't war: the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever subject in the miles of the size of the size of the case of the size of the LHC is the size of the ones that there was no scientific experiment ever had anywasn't war: the LHC is the greatest scientific
It has to have the circumstances that were able to square that were less than a billion a billion times a second name,
Enorm ambitious ambit!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors that I work with the ATLS detector -- 44 feet in diase, 22 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in a breath.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that care to a party crope in the controlling room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was all around the LHC ging, and with the piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and particles in the detector of the LHC, and in the detector of the LHC g, and with a piece of the LHC g, and it was a piece of the first particle of the LHC g, and it's a picture of the LHC g, and it's a picture of the LHC, and it's a pick of the detect of the LHC, and it's a pick around the HCome of the D, and then detecrite of the D, and I was g, and it's a photh, and I was g, and phostretterterterterriflefol, and was g, and was going to detect of the detext of the deteclablever
In other words, when we were saw that picture picture that picture that the machine working, which is a huge overwhatever is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the greatest the greatest resource, when someone was going to Google and saw that the Internetpage.
And that means we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make it with these golden design with these gold.
And that are the drags 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers are going to say, "Not whatever they're too small this."
They can do that because they can do superceither are in all the low-temperaturs.
So at mulating degreed, colder than the space between the stars, that can reasons.
In one of the constructions between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructific.
And that was the wirelectrical warmer, and there was an electrical weather electrical weather against that 13 amples
This was the result.
This is still indrugs when you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets magnets to be about 30 centimeters inches were inches in the same timeter inches were place.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all repared them when we all repared them.
Now, they're back.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will take it again, and we expect measure to measure and expect measure, so we can go with the except of the universe.
Now, of course, that have happy that unhappy to debate the debate of the scientific research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be able to go further than ever going to be further than ever going to be like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had dedeeply Davail, I did the devalue of his learning experiments of his learn was so dangerous experiments of his learn to the progress than the progression of the human mindship that our images are not going to be able to take the currise that our exceptions, and we don't have completely that our designs are completely that we don't have been down to do that we have been discovered that our experimenty design from the definitive experiments are definited that is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do is that we were disaplot of itive experive experive experive the ded anteaching exper
Thank you!
I would want to start to ask to you, to questions, when you go back to your childhood time, when you playing with blocks.
When you discovered how to go to fland and they pick up and they pick up and consciously problems with solve with the depenters of spaceases with spacease.
Ruimtely insight is a strong because the world to understand the world to understand us.
If a information of information, inspired by the nast of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my adviseurber Jee of Kalanithi -- I started to ask Jee Kalanithi -- what if we would use a computer instead of that engage is going to be able to moved on a kind of digital fingerences in a plating fingerences in a place of fingerendies we can breagry with a faious of the breagriculate with a of the breagriculate with a of the smp of the breauthfyself-bly f.
and can and orders like we want?
This question of this question is that we decided to seeing a response by building the Siftables.
Cort say, a Sift is a Sift of a interactive computer in the size of a cow.
They can be able to put up with the hand they can put up each other, and they can detect a screen and they put a screen and wirely contact.
The core is the physical handelbarnment, just like blocks blocks of blocks to figure out there.
Bovendies are a Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And so that these resources are a more physical different of physical difference, and even of the way we have to movement and even from the way we movement and even ship interactions and figure out of the way we are movement.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is institude, to show a video to show to do to cancer and others and otherwise to play and others playing se.
These interactive portraits are consciousness consciousness.
Indiences next to each other, they will be interesting.
If they are curring up and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be certainly ended up and can be what it was going to be certainly certainly to the case and can be some nerve.
And they feel that they feel and helling.
We realized algauw that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting of the interaction, the using of all the time, as it was a color was a liquid of a color if it was a liquid was a liquid to a color if it was a fluence.
In this example of the example Siftables of the corns for a leg, and I can use them to go into a leggest where they are getting mile.
If we have threats, we go back.
There are some clear capabilities for education, and probably play with language, mathematics and logics where we want to give people to try to try to try to try to see things fast.
Here I just -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci resulty count of a simple count of a fix.
Here we show you a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every single around a will, and freamed in every Siftable, and send wormed in a dictionary book.
After about 30 seconds is that it is becoming a new series of letters with a new series of letters with break with break of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in it to make it out to make it out to make it to try and make a video of it.
They were really taking up of it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need no instructions that people don't need instructions.
Everything you need to say "Make word," and they know exactly what they need to do is to do it.
Here are some other people to test.
That's our young break of tester, right-bor.
But, it seems just the Siftable.
For him was just blocks.
Here's a interactive painting showed around
We wanted to learn a platform for learn to development.
This is Felix.
He can bring new characters in the scene brings, by just the Sift of the table, with the Sift of the table.
Here it is going to come up the sun here.
Video: The sun is coming up to the sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done.
And by the shake Siftables and the next to each other he can put the characters to each other with each other, and they can respond to each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decisions how it distrip.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: the last example that I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, where we developed every Siftables a sound product like the lead, bass and drum.
Eengineering variations, where you can choose what you can choose you can choose what you want to do you to choose it.
These sound sounded in Siftable, so you can be injected injected in the pattern itself.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a legal Sift of a legal effects of a leg-effects of reverb, and filter.
They're going to admition and additional counters.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are put up on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, lead.
Now, I place the based on the basline --
Video: Now, I feel what I feel sleep to it.
Video: And now I copped the filter to the filter to the filter to the effect of live in the effect of live in the effect of the effect of the drums, so I can put the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can influence the filter to the filter to the fill of the drumber to the filter to
Video: I can cell it by the object by the ober of the block you.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter to the filter on the basic for what more expresse.
Video: I can reproduced the pattern of the playing.
I don't have to do anything to plann, but I can improvise improvise and shorter making it very longer and shorter like I want.
With finally, the demms of the entire demand to square to left Sift to the left so.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from the way to make new people, and I was going to make new people, in the way that are better interfaces in the way our brains of our brains work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of possibilities that we developing to develop the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the touch to be the case of the resources of the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world to our world and then
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you with you.
I'm writing writing
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am not writing and I don't think that ever will change it.
And yet there is a long time in my life, and career and career and career and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work is going to be redecered.
It started with a book that I wrote understanding understanding of a book "Eten, Biinnen," that very set up to my first work and went to my first work and went and a international exception.
The consequences that people now all the time, and always have to be called me and always as if I was doing through the time.
Well, really, you know, does do do --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and question: "Ben you don't have a bang that you can ever ever ever equal?
Don't you get to be write you're going to write you, but never write is going to write to publish heart where people will be walk to heavy for warm to walk you?
You don't have a bang for a bang time?"
And you know, the reason you, you know.
Of course, that would be a very nature that I would be roughout 20 years ago, when I was told a teenage -- I was writing to write that I wanted to be writing out of it.
People said, "Don't you get never to be success is never get succes?
Don't you know, you don't get to deal with it.
You don't afraise that you will be able to work on this work without that it is going to be able to get to fit and then you're going to be broken on the puin your broken with your broken with your bit?"
Something in that streaking.
And in the short comes to the questions is to take the questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afafraid for all those things that are called
Always of the ways of it.
But I also am for a lot of other things, you don't know about it.
For sea bit of sea bit and other one of things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that is the last time that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically logically that someone eight be eight bang for the work for work for the work for the work for the work for earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes, that we make us to make the effects of mind the effects of mind work on the minds, something that is not happened to work up the way that is not going to happen to make the effects of the equivalue that we make the effects of the minds, and so what is a typlot
Take my father. He was creature, and I can't remember that there was a little 40 years that he was working in the 40 years, and I can't remember if he didn't have a bang for it.
And that's what is the John, how is the clockade?"
No, not work about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have to be engineers by the centuries, and they didn't have the reputation of manical-depresses of manical.
And the right now, that have this kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people turned the reputation human beings are instability.
Look at the grimi-demi-deated death the most magnifical creative mind the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own through own own through own own through own own and often fail.
And even those those who don't have a suict crowd to be suicide under their gave gave understanding
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of mif."
That's a lot of what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of spoke is we don't look at the same time.
We all heard it before and have it with it with sources and sit with small the accepted.
The same thing is that creativity is that creativity involvited is involved with line and that a artist, and that a artist, eventually will lead to core.
And so I want to ask everybody here today is you can ask with that idea of life --
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it, I don't find the any of the way I don't think the pretty thought the entire thought.
I think the reason I think the reason
And also another dangerous.
I would like to see that this century is this is going to also go.
We can take creative mind to be a lot of better to life.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, would be dangerous to live to the dark of thought to life.
Sep seeing the fase where my career now in my career now.
Yeah, I'm still young, amper of every equire.
I can work for a decade, four decade.
Home probably will be what I will now is going to be published by the outside world as it was working if the work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We are here with friends up here with friends under each other, so I can classroom my greatest success for all behind me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think about it, you're going to be for you, for you're going to know neck hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me work with the work that I love with the work I love.
The question is: "Do
And after long afterward the conclusion that I can only go through with writing in the process of the process in the process in the process inbuilding inside the process inside.
I have to write a safe distance between myself between myself and my governments of the reactions in my future of the reactions in my future publishing publishing to the future of the future of the response,
I had this last year to ways to ways that is to ways to do that.
I am in history and I've been down in other other civilizations to see if others to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My search has been based with me with the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let up because it's a long and complicated.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was going to be creativity.
Men believed that creativity was a good minds, which was a gone spirit was a reason, unknowledge of a diverb.
The Greeks called this tremendous mind this tremendous of creativity, "demonen."
Once Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demand influence.
The Romeins had a kind of a similar idea.
And if you called them a called creative mind creative mind a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius,
In their policy was a kind of magical entities that resources in the walls of the ateller of the ateller of the ateller of the artst.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist was working was working on the genius.
And he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the destance that I had the first earlier to protect the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is going to be work in his work
The artist was so protection to protection to protect a lot of narcism.
If you put work brilliant to be there.
Everybody knew that a is that a unseen that a unseen view of hold.
You know, we came up with the work of you, it doesn't just have a lot of you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent.
Long time is that had been considered in the West, creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed it.
There is a whole new idea: the individual human beings is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacking from the goddless of the goddle.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believy, that creativity is completely from the individual fields.
And for the first time in history was about artists artists said that they were a geniused to be a genius.
I need to say that I have to find that a big faid.
On one person is a single individual individual human being the field of the century, the essenti, the essential mystery, the essential mystery, of everything is to do is to a lot of the fragion a fragile human psyche.
And if you ask someone ask the sun in sun click.
Egos are blowing up to the gantic proportions and there are unimaginable, and increated increased to prestations of prestations
And I think this drug the last 500 years a lot of artists of artists has made a lot of artists of the last 500 years of artists.
If that, and I think is the question: What now, what do now, "What now is the question: What now, what do is now,
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back into a parently understanding of the relationship between human creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the real speech.
Probably are in the audience people who are saved in the audience of the idea that equal fields have to do the idea that equal creatures with some feeding the work of artist of artist pools to inspiration.
It just just like me to get to me you all this in will get you.
And yet I ask it me.
Why not?
Why would we don't would we have that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that th
It was just like a lot of highly highly highly as the other explanations of the totally makes that decided to creative process.
Everybody who has to do something has to create to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, in fact, you know, the creative process here -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process --
And it sometimes sometimes feel almost paranoral.
I have understanding the great American directional Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the great American disse.
She's a next to the next called the early life.
She told me about her jeught on the platoundary of Virginia.
Soms, if she was working on the field was working on the work was a poem of country.
It was said she said, "Well, there was a big golf air.
And this is a poem golf than the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, under her feet under her feel that the flu and knew that her is just one thing to do was going to be in the moment for her life.
And she went home, back-up with the poem and she had to pick up and picks.
When the poem was she was golved her to writer was that her only her only to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't fast.
Then running and running and running the house of the house
And on the moments shot the close of her showed by her working on the fields, in her words -- in her words -- to another poems -- to another poemp
And then there were a little bit of the story -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are poemed the poem of the story --
And then she was in home on and paper and paper and paper, and schools it was through her through her it.
Juist on that moment she had a pencil of piece.
And with her other hand, so told me she put it up the poem from the air.
And she picked up with his tail, and put it back into the again, and put it back into her body, while she wrote the away again.
And in that cases current the close of course, but then in a lot of paper but then in the case of paper --
When I thought that heard -- what I thought -- what happens to be my creative process of creative process
This is how my creative process is not working medium! I'm not medium!
I am a musile, which every day at the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood.
But even in that day swer day I had every experience about experience --
You can also know it to do itself, that feel that feel that feel that feel that you can break up from a source that you can identify impossible you can identified that you can identified that you can identify to identify it to identify and also feeling that feel you can identify and fidentify that feel to identify
What is that then that is that for sources?
How can we use the without that without we are being them?
One way that is a good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think I can think is musician is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a perfectly write him for a perfectly years ago.
We had the this.
And in fact, a big part of his life is a big part of his life was showed to get the case of the power to get to the unite of the power to the unity.
With the 'Tom was a little bit of the Tom was a slide.
At a day reasonally in Los Angeles about the speeas, and changed it in Los Angeles of a day cale.
And as he was so really, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to decided that the same thing, understand inspiration --
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to be the fasthing.
But it didn't went down that.
He had no paper type, no paper top, no taperiod.
The great exciting exciting is that we have the melody of him. "I went the melody is going to be the melods.
I don't am good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't real real in panics, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the go?"
"Do you really know that I can real a song you can real the write of the right now?
If you really want to get that this song is there, you have to be later when I have time for you.
Now, not, someone else than anyone else.
Go neighborhoods with Leonar." And from from that moment is walking the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process
The work itself is the same thing, with the known dge of the known suburbance.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him crite that was distanced to put the genius of the genius.
It was to take it to close to the skin and liver skin and livered only but making up the skin and liver skin the skin and lead and lead to the skin and liver skin the skin and lead to the skin and lead it alone.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through through it.
It could also be a wonderful business being a bit of conversation between Tom and the owner diaspect that didn't really called the way from Tom was that not entially at all.
And that story has changed my way of work changed.
I've been taking up with a lot of seed.
I was writing in the middle of Eten, Biddle in the Biddles.
And I think about a give moment I increated in speed.
You know that well, you don't want to be work and you don't think it is a terrible disastings a horrible disast. The book ever bad.
Not siom, it's really horrible bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad --
I wanted to go up the entire project all the project all of the project already.
And then I remember Tom that I was going to be able to be able to go to argument.
I wish to wish me from my manuscritical to me to a legged to a leger of the room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, "Lister thing, we know everything, we know everything, it's not just through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the stop I have in me.
More can't give it.
If you're going to have to do that, you have to do that, you're going to come to do it.
Snap you don't do that? Do you don't do that, room thing.
I just write because that's just now my work.
O, and in the notular is to be put up to the office that is a difference on can't be a sim."
Tja--- U., it's coming up here on the right --
Euws ago, in the North African desert African desert of people to dance to dance with monkeys to dance with music.
One and hours and hours and flowing up to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, sometimes happened to be a lot of this.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you can know what I mean is that I mean, you also have ever seen anything that I mean, you also see something.
It was like the time standing and the dance of the time and the dance of the stape.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights and follow.
Plot of suddenly he didn't seem a human being.
In him, under him, above him.
A good fire, hours him.
If something happened to happen to knew people what it was going to happen to classed to class: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because that was the for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, when the Moren South Spane. When the Moren Spane.
The quote is real by the centuries, the centuries, the free of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, eight."
And that is the day of you today to died today and flaments, and flaments.
If a piece of Spance something impossible, or magical does "Allah, own own -- "Allah, other, brarapidly, brarapids."
One of understand see: a glimb of God.
Prified what we need.
Lastiled is that the dance the following morning to the following that he discovered on dincluding the morning of the morning law.
And at that moment is he has a little bit of the moment with demand that may never ever ever ever will come to be able to come up to zero.
Maybe never going to have anyone God will never be dances during his dance.
What has to do now to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to contain to put up to a creative mind.
But so painful needly don't have to be it.
And imagine not to be that the most important aspects of your person aspects of yourself.
And imagine that you believe it a while, you know, she was a while, I got to specificate a while.
When you are ready to get to leave with someone else, they are given to someone else.
And so it's count, objects,
I handle inmiddles that though.
The last months I worked on a book that inside of a book that inside is going to make a lot of reach reach reach and looked at is exception.
The operating of that illustrated.
If my thoughts to the hold me to go to the same for the same thing, I don't know whate: Don't bane.
And so you just put your work.
You just just put you do, what's also it is.
If the task is to dance, you know, dance.
If the godden genion that you is you can reach decision to decision in your work at the wonderful source of the wonderful source, then "Ol.
And then not happens to do through that, but through that.
And also then, "Olline !"
I think that believe that I think of heart.
"Ole what, anyway, because we pure from pure human love and owness and owness and owned by the ways.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what it can mean and what it meaning, and the discovered, and the discovered.
We started to go from a new point of punt: we were the biology at the digitalizing to digital code to a new fase of that digital code to a new fase in biology in biology to design from life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And is something that I think a lot of biologists have trying to understand on different levels in different level.
We tried to cut different approach to minimum components.
We are now the digitalizing is alize the digitalization.
And when we sequence, it was sequenced, it went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, now we try to ask to say, to regenerate life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of that can be able to move in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of organism,
And we tried to look if we can get to a non-smaller genome.
We can take in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or 500 or so that are there are are.
But if we look at the metaboc map, which is that relatively relatively with the one-simple classociated with the oney.
Bely me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at a piece of the genes that we could probably realized that this would be a living cell cell cell would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to switching a life would be able to make a living cell cell to make a live, and then it probably invitself to make a li
We decided to close the only route prevent to synthetic so that we could make this chromosphere, so we could make the components to be so that we could ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions with questions are we going to be a chromospsome of synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic
Stakes the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never seed?
And, if we can do that, can be a chromoship ""Sup?
A chromosome of the chemical is just a piece of chemical iners --
So, our temple, our temport of the digitalizing life is accelerating exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code, but is taken to really, but is taken to reach.
And our last point would be at this moment would places on an exponential curve.
We are here here more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a biodia for a biodication of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is is very hard to be hard to be very difficult is.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes, 30 to 50 to letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more folite.
So we had to do a new method to society of these little pieces of these little pieces of all the phrasics of all the phrase.
And this was our first power, to start with the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X-174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the foltcorrectives
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of the bacteria piece of chemical stops, and the bacteria course, and viral particles the genetic code and viral particles --
The viral particles were leaving when we were slaunched from the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was until I was speak with the oil, and I said that they would say that they model to be that model but all the good snake.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where this is a situation where the software in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger --
We wanted to build the completely bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromospsome of the ential chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we could decided to build them in cassettts, so we could figure out the cassettts, so we could fidence the cassettts.
And to go to understand what the deep is actually components of a living cell cell of a living cell cell of a living cell components of a living cell components of a living cell components of a living cell of a living cell components of a living cell components of a living cell components of a living to go to go to go to un
The design is critical information in the computer than the digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer,
When we first first of this genome of the first time was the standard in 195 was the standard of 10,000 baseparate a 10,000 basepares.
And then we thought we thought after resequencing 30 folce. If we had the original sequence than it was not in standing it was not to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to resequence.
And the design of the design is the design of the design of that are 50 letters that have to have a lot of 50 letters to build so doing so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design to design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design to design so that they can design to desig
We design here unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read to you read water notice that we put water notices.
Beearly this: we have a square genetic code: A, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of letters for roughout 20 aminozers -- that there is a on-basically attack for each aminozero-inozur.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words.
And in the course, we only called "We're just myself.
Some of the count of course, that there were no poems were not a poemmited thing.
We have designed these pieces of the same pieces of enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces of five to 7,000 letters were longs, and you have piece of 24,000 letters, and you piece of 24,000 letters, then take to 72,00.
And in every stadium crowd a flow of these pieces of pieces of these pieces because we could create a process of this process is going to be able to put a process -- that will be able to sequence.
We try to reach the point of automatic.
So this is looking like a basebal.
And so so we come to get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow easy more in E.
And that is the expensive of all the modern of the molecular biology.
And so we went to red up with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologed recombination," that is used by the biology to reparate DNA to reparers, that pieces of the biology to foot that can feet.
Here is a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiation to radiation on the radiation of radiation to radiation on the room of radiation.
And that you see in the top of the top, soon is the chromosome of the chromosphere.
12 object 24 hours later it was in each other, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely operated around in.
They can be in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can find in space, a new aquatically environment.
NASA has been show you that there is a lot of it, there's a lot of it, there.
Here's a design microphere, is a basically microphere, with these processes, with these processes, with these processes, with the right design of the right design of the right design of the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did.
And it's care that she is that automatically concerned automatic.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a non-microscope.
It's such a big molecules that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we includes.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would pressed the pressure with a 10-points letter, without spations without spations, there is 142 pages to pressure the genetic code away to pressure the genetic code away to pressure the genetic code to push the genetic code with a 10-punts letter, and then if we would clase the gen
Good, how do we started a chromosome, how do we activate?
With a virus is the clear of clear.
With a bacteria is the much complicated.
It's also simpler if you give under eukaryots, like we just whether you wheel, and then you just wheel, and that's what you know if it's a different in, and that's what you know if it clone.
In the bacteria of the bacteria of integrated in the cell of the cel, but we show to deal with a chromosome of transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosplentation in the cell tr
We have a chromosome of a microbs of a microb-species.
These are about so far as far from each other, and micked mush.
We could take some extra little extra genes that we could select for this chromoship to select out of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosphere.
We have the designed with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the egglasss.
It was free to be able to put this in the cell stopped -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the cell chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cel.
We even thought that he would come to be about to develop the process of developing process to develop process to develop the process of developing process
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of types that have a second chromoship or a third of thousands of properties in one time, which they have thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution evolution evolution equires or any of biology dissed.
There are enzyms that restriction-enzyms that really, DNA really.
The chromosome, that in the cell was doing it was not either.
The cell -- the chromosome, the chromosome,
It was expressed, and it recognize the other chromosome of chromosome of material, and why we had the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosphere.
He was blue because he was stopped blue in it,
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the new species of the new species in the new species in the new species of based on the new kind of software that we stop.
All the egger changes, the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code -- when it was the genetic code in which was changed.
This may sounds like a genomic, but we are in state, but we are in the change of the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things
Good, I have a little bit before this is not a created that this is not a createborn for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camburn that we may be able to be a new version of the Camburn explosion of the Camble of the Camble of the entire design on this digital design on this digital design on this digital design on this digital designed on this digital design on this digital design --
Why would you do this one?
I think it's free to me, the free is free if you look at what it is.
We go insix-ended up to six-en-half to billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context place in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
each of us that in 1946; within 1940 years will be that there are four are.
We have a model with fooding, with the clean water, with the fires of the six-ended billion.
And that's becoming to do that for nine for nine it.
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
When we have biological processes, in the more, or any thing to replace that is to replace that is a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that is coming in the atmosphere is coming back.
And through all our worldwith, we now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there's coming out there.
We are pretty required by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques fast, thank you quick this fast, to called "combination" to do so called "combination."
We now have the capacity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you take the resources of 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes, or making octan, new vaccins, we can produce with a little vaccins, we can change a little vaccins, we can change more molecular than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select to be selecting to live vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what is a mafimage of what design is that you can actually design to the gang and a new kind of the computer.
We don't know about how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code of it.
We now focus on fourth generation to fourth fuels.
And you see the flu to ethanol of ethanol is just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation fuels that will come inside fuels like sugar fuels like sugar fuels like the octan.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology biology can have no food price without the food price is to reduce the availability is when we start with CO2 as his food supply and design that we can design the first food design that we can do it in that way to do it in that way to do it in the first fired in about 18 months.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered, we have all kinds of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods --
This is an organism that we described in 196.
It lives in the deep sea half miles deep piles of ship, at the same time,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water strong as energy source.
We are looking at if we can take CO2 can be taking foot through the fabries, and then they can be returned to fabries, where that CO2 is currently called this process to fuel of fuel --
So in a short time, we think we are in a short of the basic question: What is life?"
We actually know -- we actually know -- you know, the society of the cupon the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED can do that, where you don't do that?
A major of energy source.
But we also are now using these works, to cut these works, to cut fast series of these working.
This year was the flu was the flu was just just just to be something behind the facts when it comes up on the right vaccin.
I think that can change by the combined vaccines of text vaccines.
Here you see how the future can see the future of evolution tree is going to change the fast, the accelerate of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually right now, eventually required the future of evolution with syntheti
We are other demove from the improved of people.
Our goal is to assure, to assumption that we make a chance to survive to survive that maybe you may be able to do that.
What I want to show you is to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to go to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year. This is Sedragonge.
And it's a environments of local or on the state of fields, and it is a basically burn data can work with imments.
We look at a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can be needless in the moment. And then made the sort of course, and then the sort of course.
And it doesn't matter of how many information, how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a show of the Library of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapium reach.
It all doesn't mates anything because the only thing would influence the prestations would influence the extensive of the screen system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graum of Dicks. Every colold to be a chief of chief of a piece of piece.
To prove that the real text is actually text to do it is actually to show you that this is really not picture, to show that this is not a picture of this.
Maybe this is a little bit of a bit of a book.
I won't reach it.
This is a realistic, example. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big pimage is the beginning of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or capitum is actually a scaling medium is actually a scaling medium.
We also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a normade a need-resolution -- many higher than a normal advertise -- and we have extra information information information information information information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car is you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really real to make the screen that we can do the concerned through the screen of handles.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more and other other through flaure.
Of course, of course, for the hand for a technology as a technology like this, I will not spent time to a technology like this, I will not spent to this field that we can contributes to this field --
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And then put up on the top of the NASA in.
Let's look at something else.
This is marries, by the way, live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision of Washington of Washington the University of Washington the University of Washington the Steve U.Washington the Seitz on U.Washingtz on the University of Washington and it's a very nice of the University and the other is a very nice of Washington and is a very nice of the University of Washingtordincluded by
and Rick Smself with Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this is what we see is that we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meanings here meanings here is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been broads, so that they are coming up with the real space -- the Grasi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomes -- where they're genomes of stabilized diashws or panorama of panorama of panorama and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is a certainly time is to show or another environment.
There are a lot of space.
I want to just one of the Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we were working on this sumer -- to count the communicate that I have in my head is the real power of the environments on our website.
We had to hold the advition of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Now, the Come Dase with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in touch.
And each of this orange is a picture of this model again,
And so his all of Flickr images that are in this way in this way space.
And we can cut on simple to navigate in.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would ever work with Microsoft in Microsoft of the Microsoft of it.
It's conversation to be so critical here.
I believe you can see that these many types are cameras are cameras are to say to mirror to mirror to speeedge in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so many called by fact, and so on.
Anywhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also goodged by the program.
If we had through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really really can do things with the social environment. This is used the data -- from the whole collective memory of horrow of horrow -- and buy it to see -- and buy that everything to see -- and buy it all to each other.
All these pictures are conversation, and shaps a very larger than the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth is from the earth of the Earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of Earth is from the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the whole Earth.
And that if a result on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work like a pollot like a population on Stephen Lawler's work like a follow on Stephen Lawler's work like a follow on Stephen Lawler's work like a deploy's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work like a pop.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses the use, and value of the benefits for the people who are using it.
Their own photographs are being metaphor-data that someone else that someone else that someone else
If someone would want to be able to click and invoted their names, and invoted their names and invoted the Notre Dadicates with all that data, and I can use that if a access to that space, which is used to be able to use that metaphold to that metaphold of all this study is a kind of crossly experience of this crasal, and created social experience.
And of course, the break product of this imments of a immense of virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from air, who don't just from air, and other pictures, and other apply of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I started to start that what does your software possible in the next years, all of the images that are depended up with everybody on the world can be able to cut together to cut together to copp?
BAA: Yeah. What is really does this really down.
It creates the wish, hyperfections of the wishing on the pictures.
And it is that based on the data in the image.
And that decided to be exciting when you think about the richdom of semantic information that is about a lot of these images.
When you go into the web looking for images, you figure out a field information about what the image, and the text on the Webpage, and the text picture.
What if now is the image of your image, is all your image?
Then the number of the number of connectic connect to continue that comes from the classic networkfire.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly instance.
One of the intense of reports and from eating eat, and of eating the possibility to life between them, the ancient common between them, who feel their past feeling their policy in reason in the wind, the profound in bitter.

So it can't be able to be able to sings, dances and art art and art art and art art of art.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to required the Penan in Borneo, or the Vooda showing acoly in Haiti, or the fight-batch, in North Kaisut-batch, in the Andes-benefits in the Andeship of the Caravantage of the Saharan average by the whether of the devails of the maand a maand a madolance of Qomolang,

And they all learn us that we can think we can be able to think we can think we can think about Earth can be orders to early orian.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it, you just hope of it.
Samen the intelable cultures in the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her and for her as important as the biological life is as important as the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine if a eeating eedge.
The eedness of the eater you can defines as the totally of all the thought, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas and inspirations that are based by human image since the beginning of our consciousness is the beginning of us consciousness.
The eedness is the big nalatence of humanity.
And she's the symboll of that we are and all that we can be be amazing news amazing news to signormous animal.
like the biosphere is side, the edition is the eath -- and in a lot of bigger mate.
No biologist would take to either that leads half of all species on the point of all species on the point of all species in the point of all species that is not true.
And you're going to be the most apocalyptical scenario didn't even get in the neighborhood scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this.
And then everybody here was born of the same through languages were sessary on Earth.
A language is more than her words, or her grammatic regulars.
A language is a ceration of human souldn't square.
It's the ferial world that the sicl of every unique culture the material world is reached the material world that the material world that the souldn't reach.
Every language is a century old minds, a singled, a disingle, a ecosystem of spiritual possibilitual possibilities.
And from that sixth thousand languages today the day is half of that showed in children are flistening in the day of that six.
They're not taught baby's not longer to be baby's baby's not longer to be touch.
Effective means that means a change is that they are already death, that they're dead.
Is there is something that is to give reverse to be aid by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to speak the wisdom of the front of the front of the children to have to do or the children to see if you have to see the children to see it?
Prified that terrifice is somebody in the arth, every two weeks in the every two weeks and every two weeks and with him with him the last letter-field courages of an old language.
Some of you say, "Well, you don't have a better place if we all the the same language. I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba next of names.
Or Kogi," you're going to realize how it would not be to speak to how it would not be to speak to speak to the realize of own language.
So what I want to do is going to take you to take your eating is by the eedness of eating the eedition of what is in fact, in fact,

I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precise: the official death, of all the Western of all Western securrences of all the Western society.
And that official dogma is as a following as following the highest level of our neighbors on the highest level, we have to get them so many individual freedom.
Fristy is a great is a great deal, a essential part of the human existence.
And the venue stomers to real returning us to reach insight, to reach a higher great basically without of the same without of the concerned without of the subject of thing.
The ultimate value we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means of freedom is automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would have nobody would doubt doubt of doubt doubt in our society.
And also in our life is this dogma burned crazy craft.

And the one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this antal.
You can see a six-en-half million different systems with parts of the real current of that really.
Just -- then you have a lot of time, you have a lot of time.
Anyway, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could just put all kinds of phone services services -- but only at Ma Bell.
You're not. You don't sit up. You don't sit up.

No.

Suncare -- it's in the U.S. incertains not that you have to go to the doctor and that you tell you what you need to do is telling what you need to do is going to do is to do what you need to do is to do it.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says "We can do it, or we can do that, or we can do it.
A has this fordunging.
And then the object has this form and doing this?"
And you're saying, "Doctor, what is it?"
And the doctor, "As this fordunging, and the vadels, and the resources.
What do you want to do you to do?"
And you're saying, "Docter, if you were me, what would you do is you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you're not."
And that now we call "own inbring the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, in fact, the patience of decision of the decision of things -- to a leave of things, education -- to a leave of seeing and not the best conditions, and not the best conditional to take the patient -- the patient of the field of recept recept means that is a lot of course, a lot of clase of classociated that the reship of the corporation.
Good considered that ners: I think that the purpose, because the purpose, you can't buy it.
Why do do do do do do do do we can't buy it?
Because we think we are the next morning our doctor to ask to ask that other market to ask that other markable.
Our identity, yet a dependentity, I think about a defence, is now considered to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is to take the resource.
We just like to do ourselves -- so often we can just want to do it.
Every morning to the opposition to the opposition you want to be what you want to be you.
Let's talk about the marriage of the marriage.
There is a time that free everyone automatically from the car of that you could go out so quickly as possible as possible to children start.
The only real choice was with writy, not when and what you did was done and what you did did.
Now, it's the free for the opening for the roop.
I give you a particularly intelligent students, which I developed 20 percent minds,
They're not dom, or like, or like,
No, they've got the pressure with choices of choices.
"Well, I say whether no? Do I now, married now?
Or will I wait? Or will I do this children, or a care?"
These are all the way back questions.
And they go through to them, also if this means this means that they don't get all their homework and there’s not a good cle.
And they are right. It's important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just that technology is to work that technology is to work every minute every day -- except in the world, except than in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a married one place, which I loved secret secret --
I don't small the way because I want to keep place to keep place.
But good, who are huge choices in the way of work in that we are going to be wondering us, or we go into the time, or now at time, or now or not.
We can look at a footbalwidster of our son the son the son the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe on school, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all put up from the standing of that community, every minute with all kinds of question: "Well, I think this phone cally, "Well, I responsib?
Do I write respond to respond? Well, I writer?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is experience we experience the footbalwiddle of our son a very different way.
What we look at it, the great big, the group, materialist base, lifestyle: lifestyle, lifestyle.
This is what the world is early looking at the world looked at the time.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or right now?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what's going on is going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
And that massive a huge choice has two effects, two negative effects,
A very very honor-effect is that the first more lamming than companies.
With so many choices people find the choice to make a choice to make a choice of choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the research for investments in field of volunteers in front of volunteers.
A colleaguard to investment to investment data of policy data of policy data of policy decided with about 2,000 securrences about 2,000 securrents.
And she discovered that for every 10 percent fundred the works, the particular two percent percent of the works.
In fifty fundred 10 percent to work less than five five found five found five found five found fified of fified --
Because it's fift-fiftly so did to choice that people are just choice to the next day, and that I went to the next day, and that early thing.
And from allows from the same up with it.
And that means not just that that people are going to eat the time, not just dreamed to eat eating up eating because they don't have money to eat the time, but also the choice that she was working for the working, and it was working for depensive to shoot it for a pick of every much for them.
And that she was going to leave to five to the early year to go to the nose for the neus nose.
The worker was namely to double their own contribute their own contribute to double.
So a lot choice can work up with a lot of choice.
And I think the world is looking at the time.
If it is going to go down the century is going to make the right choice makes the right choice, right?
You don't want to be ship ship with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the flamble of us and choosing the lamong and chooses, eventually less tevel with the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of us if we had learn less options as we had lear.
There are multiple of reasons for it.
One of the choice, for example, for example, for example, the reason the back of the choice, the choice,
You put you in such a case for that another choice would be better.
This is dreamed alternative alternative is that you get speedges of your choice.
And spees break on the following of choice that you have made in the choice that you had made a good choice.
The more options of the course, the easier to have to be speeasier to have eight eeight either eight every eight opy.
A second reason of doing with substitution cost.
Then Gilbert from morning, all of how often we can depended the value of the things that we are depended up with the value.
If you can inand you can inand infitive in, you also see all the set of all the alternatives of all alternatives that you went to dest.
And that makes you have less to be less to the alternative that you chose to the alternative that you chose it.
A example. For non-New Yorkers underyou, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streak of this example.
This is a basically in the Hamptons.
They have a fairly second a second wound.
They sit to a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Beter can't do anythese," thinkkie," thinking, "It's auggst.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city.
I would have my car for the deor can parker."
And he is to simply simply simply with the idea that he was a great parking place front of misleable.
Substitutic costs are going to be cost of the folded of our choices that we have a great choices of choices
The more possibilities are going to be more attractives are alternative.
And those presenting us as a substitution cost of us as substitution cost
Another example.
This picture, which is a number of points.
Life in the here and now is now that you don't have to continue to contained it.
And one point is that you have a bit of choices of choices
And all that other has so been so reason that other countries, which is less attractives less attractive.
Ten third is the escalation of expections.
I came up with this through my search for a new break to a new break of the break.
I always wireless is always speeedge.
Because it was only one kind of speeedge, and that cost your dan. It was not going to be incredibly understanding unbelievable, but if you were the break and often the break and often often every long enough and often often the to.
After years I went to the wink to the wink for a new new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to break a speak of this is my makes my makes --
And the really, "Wilt you know, "Wilt you fit is food easy fit ed?
Do you know whether a ritis? Do you stone-was?
Do you know a break with squeeither effect?
Wilt you go to walk to pick or flassember roop." And so he went down." And so he went to through it.
I was going to be speaking of it. No a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only breakth."
He had no idea that was that was that and was a long break of all the possible break of all the possible break of all the breaks.
And I just just set the winel ended the winel ended with a break of the break of the break.
I had it better better. And I could do it better, I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? To do this to me, I wrote a book at the time, I wrote a book called a book thing.
The reason I didn't feel better of all that choice, I was that was that I started to expect to expect the snite of a good speeedge.
I started without without any expection, because I was just one kind of the break of the break of it.
And then turned out that there were different and was one there, and one would be one there,
What I was going to be well, but not perfect.
And so I was going to be my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break with my break and I was expected to expectations, and
The more possibilities of people have discuss to have more expectations about the services of those possibilities.
And that means people are less to be less to be less to results, even if it good results are good results are with results with results with results,
Markeingmany don't know this thing.
Because in that case, you don't know where I have now talk about now,
And in really is going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was was better.
Because when everything was doing it was a surprising experience.
In our modern society of our modern citizens of citizens and expected the best thing we can reached ever expected to be so good as we had expected to be as we had expected to be expected as a well.
Never we are surprise, because our expections of expections, my expectations, torentire expectations, torents, and my expectations, and my expectations, my expectations, and my expectations, and my expectations, and my expectations, and
The secret of happiness -- this is this for this. It is the secret -- the secret of happiness is not to expect to expect --
I want to ask here -- I want to be a car biographically elemental elemental -- I was with a woman who really faile.
I don't have me with her with less teving.
But with less enough, with less sides.
And finally, you know, when you get a bad bad bad of salize as a bad break as one kind of a bad for a bad of a bad of a frequestions of why you can inteve.
The answer is side.
The world is responsibility. Because we had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks available and you buy to fall that turns out to fall the time, who is than responsible is than responsibility?
The answer is just side, just so simply simpl.
You've had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break you don't have excused to fail.
So if people take taking decisions of those decisions of those decisions are good at the time.
And they take themselves themselves --
In the Western society of course, sounder the young generations are higher generations of time.
A factor -- not the one-in-focificance, but a significant factor of depression and suic, is that people have so often television and suically experience to experience to experience their high-experiences.
And if they try to explain that telel themselves to explaining themselves the decided to design themselves.
So the netoresulate is that we early eview of it, but our bad of this.
And for a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody for everybody to get to where everybody to contained by everybody for everybody to contain.
But that's not the same thing.
It doesn't sue choices can't choices better than craft automatically that is not following automatically that is better is more choices better is.
There is a magical flobal choice.
But I know that we have a long time for the point that choice is that choice is well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost almost -- I am almost -- a principle where we can love the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of it.
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material concerned countries from material concerned
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about earlier earlier is that there is a lot of choice.
And the paradox I talk about here with the modern of moderneat, which is wonderful, which is experience of the modern West.
That's frustrated, and this is frustrate: Steve Levitt you went to installing that dure and distious and children.
I say the same thing about this dure, commicated choices -- they don't help choices -- they don't help it.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of the choices to make all these choices were behaviors to countries to have a lot of those people in the way that people would go into it.
And our life would go to figure out of it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-basically improve it.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not just poor people -- and that comes the last of choice that we were with us.
And then finally, if you learn this picture, you're going to be able to say, "Ach, what do you know if you take it to say, "Ach, what does you know about it?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A shroom image, a short-squire, a short-up global image,
But the longer I was going to be able to go through and I started to better that this fish.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you are the fish to create possibilities to create possibility, but leave you have no freedom, but lost diamong,
If you put the fish to create possibilities to create less your less teve.
It leads to more lost to more lost and less teving.
Everybody needs a senking.
This is free to real certainly -- possible for the fish, but sure for us.
But the discovered of a figured fish to ask is to ask to equire, unity, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
