Last year I showed these two shows to show that the polar cap, which was about three million years of the last three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent curved
But this distribute the records of this particular problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The ice capable to climate the North Pole is in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out of the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide I showing is a accelerated version of what's happening the last 25 years of what has happened in the last 25 years of what has happened in the last 25 years of what has happened is a accelerating of what has happened is a accelerating slide.
The permanent ice is dived in previous room.
As you can see, it looks at dark blued.
That's the early one in the winter.
And it cracked in the summer.
It called ice, five years or older or older to old five or older is almost like blood, that from the body here.
And in 25 years of this came to this called
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icel, and there was a very big warming of the North Icel, you know, when it comes up with the diother, when it comes up with microbes did, when it comes up in meth.

This is the Kangerlussua's Kanger-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea leap sea because the landice of the sea is where it comes up in the sea.
These currently flight to flip thing.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And last month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly very quickly very quickly any couple of the south islands.
The whole continent is six meters for six meter, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massa, there are now now that were now going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that melertains.
In the Andes, this glasses the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stream.
But when they disappeared, disappears of water.
In California was there a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read read this, the predictions of it.
This global dream has led to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of nature of nature world is still and never seeing and never never seen this.
Four time in the last 30 years of the last 30 years than in the forgovernment.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
And if you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years of CO2 million ton to CO2 24 hours,
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a west, there is a wearing of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, which is the navail, which is buries, which is burning fires of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and step buy is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extends of the two greatest exercise with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more step carbon centers.
But we see a course of it.
These are the voice carbon that the building was annulearned in the last few years and where green alternatives were forearly to be the last few years,
There's a political battle on the country.
The step carbon and oil industire gave in, 250 million dollars from clear to promote carbon clear, which is a counter.
And that image to me thinking about something that image to something that image me.
Rond the Christest was home in Tennessee, about four billion gallon model, four billion gallon.
You probably seen the news.
This is the one-largest disape in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the crops of the step left around the Kurst was the Kurst was this one.

Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to get back with an update about how that works.
So here I am ever -- for those of us who weren't on: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever experiment ever underneated to enter.
It has to be the circumstances that were capable of presented after the universe after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious ambitious --
This is the machine Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of the detectors of the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photo from ATLAS, in connecting to build the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party care in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle stral that all the way around the LHC should be around the LHC should be cutting up with a piece of the LHC, which was in the detector of the LHC, and put particles in the detector of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the first particle stream of the first particles of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and put particlest of the LHC, and I went around the HC, and picture of the HC, and photograph of the testready of the testristristly HC, and I should have been dom of the D, and pie, and pach of the HC, and photo be ctort ctrivick of the detecuphotographoto be
In other words, when we had these picture picture on 10 September we knew the machine worked on the machine worked --
I don't know if this is the biggest leave, or then, when somebody was going to go to Google and saw that the Internet page of the internet page of thing.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden too with these golden to.
And those wear wear agos 13 thousand amper resources when the machine.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small wear."
They can do that because they can be superceither away of temperaturs.
So at the min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the space that can down the stream between the stream between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the space between the stars, which are the strongs,
And in one of the constructions between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructifiction.
And that was something warmer, and it was something warmer, and it was something electrical resistance that was 13 thousand ampires.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realizes that those magnets magnets more than 20 tons of the ton of 20 tons of the ton of 20 centimeter.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them to do when we all have regular.
Now, they're back to away.
Eind might be the LHC again.
We will put it again, and we expect measurements in June or June so we can go further to figure out what the building building the universe.
Now, of course, who have the unhappiness of the value of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so difficult that we go further than ever ever -- the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientish Humphrey Davy, I did the dect of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraal Faraday, this is what dances the progress of human mind to take the progress of human mind of the science of the human mind of the human minds, that are completely definitive that there are no completely definitioned that there are no read."
Thank you.
I would like to start asking you back to your childhood to your childhood at your childhood at your childhood playing.
When you discovered how you could go to understand how to understand and and aware of the way to solve the problems with and learn by the surrounding of space relationships.
Ruimtely insight is strong because with the understand of the world around us.
If an information -- as an inspired by the narrations of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advisoration of Pattion and my medeal -- I started asking -- I started asking -- what if we were a computer -- what if we were a computer course, and I started to using one point of the one moist that moved as a kind of digital fingers we could put up a place of a place core course, which is close to ck of information that we could core core close to the hands information that move to the privast,
and can earn the way we want?
This question of this question of us that we decided to look for a answer to seeking the building of Siftables.
Cortines is a Sift is an interactive computer in size of a cookie.
They can be able to be moving on the hand they can feel each other, they can feel each other, and they contact a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded by understanding of blocks they can be moving through there to understand through it down to understand the nuclear understanding of the nuclear understanding of the nuclear understanding of the core core understanding of the nuclear understanding understanding of the core core under.
And so becomes Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
By that these tools have a more physical different physical different and of their movement and even of the way we have each other, and even of the way we are them, are different new and nice of the way we have and nice interactions and fun,
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is institution to show to do a video that plays, which is playing by cancering and others and others are playing to play the back of the back
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious conscious.
And then they will be place each other, they'll be interest.
And if they get surrounded this, they can notice this, and can also be able to do this,
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that we also have one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction of the interesting of the color was a liquid -- as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid --
In this example three Siftables, and I can use them to go and use them to go to small these color in a leg in a leg where they are being mixed to be college color.
And if we have overleft, we have to save what we did back.
There are some capabilities for education, mainly possible game with language, mathematics and logics where we want to give people the capable to probability to try and try and make it quickly uncture.
And here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic of a Fibonacci -- this is the development of a Fibonacci -- this is the development of a Fibonacci -- this is the development of a Fibonacci --
And here we show you a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single raround a will, to get a pretty Siftable, and sensed the words are being controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is going to be rescued and seems a new series of letters with breaking,
Thank you.
These are some children on excure to the Media Lab, and I'm sequenced them to get it out of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly nearly nearly instructions that people nearly nearly nearly instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make word," and they know exactly what they need to do.
These are some other people at test.
That's our young basic batch, right-base courtys.
It seems he just seems the Siftable.
For him were just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting shown painting
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
And he can bring characters in the scene of the scene of the Sift with that character-called the table.
And here he let me come up with the sun
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done be!
By shake the shape of Siftable, and the next to each others are responding to each other, "Wealy.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hellow!
DM: It's a story with an open end up with an open end.
and he decision how it distrip.
Video: The cat flying.
DM: The last example that I'm going to show today Is a synthesizer and live music chilstrument that we have evolved recent that every Siftable, where every Siftable, as the lead, bases and drum.
One has every one of them ariations, where you can choose which you can choose which you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in emptable, so you can determine the pattern so you can determine the pattern of themselves.
You can put a sound in the pattern by the couple of Siftable of a live controlled effects of a live controlled as reverb and filter.
They're being an sound and addition of cancounter.
And the general effects like tempo and the volume that are being applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a leave pattern, to a lot of extra lead.
Now, I place the basline this.
Video: DM: Now I feel feel a little slagwork.
Video: There I now the filter to the filter to the filter to the drum so that I can influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate it by the cancer of the blocky.
Video: There I buy the filter to the filter to the filter to the filter of the expression.
Video: DM: I can reproducing the pattern as it playing.
So I don't have to planned everything to plann, but I can improvision, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And finally the dims of the dims of the volume Sift to the volume left to can.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion to make new human-computer interfaces that have been standing better interfaces that have been stemed in the way our brains and work our brains and work our brains and work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of design area with some possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attack to a very new generation to a very new generation of interact with digital media, which brings the information to our world as we wanted to do it.
Thank you very much of heart.
I look at it to you all of you all of you.
I'm writing writing.
Booking writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm at the point of writing and I don't think that ever will change it.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career for my life, and career through my life with my work with my work with my work.
It started with a book that I wrote understanding of a book that I wrote a memoire, "Eten, Biddle," which was very opposed to my earlier world and an international stator.
The consequences me now people all over the time, and always like I cated to be currently ave.
And really, really, you know, doing --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you never afraid to be success to never success is never going to be success
You don't afraid you will stay your whole life write you'll be write write that people will walk up for warm to heavy heaven, where people will walk to hear warm you?
You don't you afraid there?"
And you know, rise affect you know.
Of course, that would be very several remember that I was rough, I was a tener 20 years ago, when I told a teenager,
People said, "You don't afraid you'll never afraid success you're never going to get success
Don't you afraid to provide through it down through it do?
You don't afraid you will live your life to this work without of this work without of your broken and you're going to die on the public of broken dreams with your mouth broken with your mouth bitters of bitter?"
And it was the stretches.
And the short comes my answer to that questions ask that questions down this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that become.
Always the way
But I'm also afraid for a lot of other things that all you don't want to know which all of it.
For example, for example, and other single things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time that comes fear from, where that fear from.
Is it rational rational?
Is it logically somebody gets afraid to be afraid to the work for the work for the work that they put up to their opinion on on Earth are they put on the Earth are they put on the Earth are they put to their opinion on earth of the work that they are they put their opinion to their opinion to their opini
What is so particularly exciting processes that we worry to create the effects of them on the minmind of the mindness, something that is not happened to be able to do the other species.
Tather. He was a chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was any in the 40 years that he was working on him or he didn't have any of him or he didn't afraid it for it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so didn't be talking about it.
To be fair to be charge, charge engineers have no reputation by the centuries are not the reputation of manician-depresses for manical alcoholists.
And so writers well, those kinds of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputation mental reputation mental reputation mental reputation mental top.
Look at the corner death death the most magnificant creative minds of the 20th century.
And many died young, often by own own by own own own to it.
And even those those who are not suicide of suicide are seem to be seem to be seem to be constituence.
In the last interview for his death, Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's what to say to say about your life work.
But of this kind of except we don't look at any more.
We heard it all earlier and have heard it all before all accepted earlier.
The heart of thought is that creativity understanding is that creativity to suffering and that an artist, and that will lead to counter.
And so I want to ask everybody here today ask today, can you with that idea life?
You know, you have that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it at all, I think about it doesn't really find the pretty though.
I think of the reason I think of the reason
And also dangerous thing.
I would like to see this century that this century is that this century.
We can do creative sports much better to live for.
I sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark thought of the dark thought of that dark getting thought of the situation,
And the phases the phase where my career now is now in which my career now
Go only after that, I'm young, amper resistance.
I can still four decades four decades.
Hue-probably will be everything I'll get to now now is being seen the outside world as the world as the work that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up with friends, so I can do it you probably slight my biggest success of my biggest success of behind me.
Yem, which is a sense of an idea !
And if you think of the way you go to the morning to the morning to the next hour necessarily hours to the next hour and all the next hours of the morning to the next hour and all the next hours of you're going to be neck hour and right hours to know at the morning hour and early again, you know, for the nine hour
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work that I love to the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work where I love of the work that I love with the work that I love
The question is, "Do "How?"
And after long as I think I can go to the conclusion that I can go through with writing a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write at the writing safe distance between myself and my overboars very understanding for the response to the reactions of the reactions on my futures to the response to my future publissue for the responses of the future,
I was looking at ways of the last year to ways to do that.
I've been down in history and have directing in other other civilizations to see if others have found a better way, to help creative people to help creative people to help create the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let me saying, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeins and Romeins people didn't believe that creativity was not going from hunency of itself.
And believed that creativity was a divine mind was a divine spirit was a divine of a divine and unknowledge of unknowledge, to unknowle.
The Greeks now called these demonstrated of creativity "demonths."
And so, Socrates believed he had a demon who had a demoon that he had influde.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And in the called creative mind creative mind creative mind a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius doesn't a particularly pient.
In their promise was a genius, a kind of magic divine entities that are upon the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the house.
And as the artist, artist, the genius was the genius of assistance.
And he gave shape he gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier talking to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artist, the artist, the artists of protection to for example,
And if you were working brilliance was not all the ear.
Everybody knew that was a view genius that you had hold.
Well, you know, you work on the way that not just you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather individual independent genius.
And the way of the time that has been created in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There is a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual humans is the universe and the state of the universe and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, attended from the divine world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity, that creativity came out of the individual came of individual came out of the individual came from the individual.
And for the first time in history was the history of artists said that they were a genius, and not that they were a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big mistake.
To one person, one person, one person, one person to show believe he or she or she or she she or she she or she is the critical mystery, of everything good -- that is to be known and it's something to a lot of responsibility for a fragilection of a fragileft of a psyche.
Anybody asks you to swer the sun in sun
Egos are being blowing blowing up to a huge proportions and there are unimaginable expectations of prestions.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists made a lot of artists of artists made a lot of artists of artists that capabilits has made a lot of artists of artists that appropriate the last 500 years of artists made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the rel
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes for a 18 minutes of speaking.
And probably sit in the audience people who have required saved the idea that eliminatal passocial of the idea that eliminatory cool the work of artists to inspire artists to inspire inspiring high tools that brings are bringing high to inspire the idea that are probably primary of arti
It doesn't seem to get to all of you in that.
And yet I went to me.
Why not?
Why would we have to do we have this thought of thought of the next to next to next to next to next that thought of thought would we have thought to next that thought would we have to follow?
It cutes, and it cutting the total explanations of the total counternity, that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has no way to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, all the presents -- you know, it doesn't always the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process -- you know, that it doesn't always be able to create anything that is not always to create anything that is not always trying to create anything that we are always to
That sometimes almost paranormal.
I have recently the great American close of American Ruth Stone meet meet of Ruth Stone meet meet of the close Ruth Stone meet of the close Ruth Stone of the closer Ruth Stone meet meet of the wonderful American em.
She is closes in the nine. Her whole life writing them.
She told me about her jeught on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field of the work, she felt comes a poem comes a country.
It was so said, like it said, like there was a big wave air came air came to came air came air came to call the wave air.
And then poem poem wave than the land to her
She felt that the ground, she felt that the shake started shaking her feeling that moment only understanding for her life.
And she ran home, back home, back through the poem and then they had to do and see paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and primary solid to home, back home, and she had to see so quickly possibly possible.
When the poem through her came her came was that her one was that her enly her opportunity to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then run, but run, now, but reached the house.
And at the moments her high school close by her hands, search -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another close --
And I think of the story of it was any -- this is the most most part of the story -- that she poem the poem -- that she poem the poem of the story -- that she was doing the poem of the story -- that she was almost of the story -- that she was almost impact -- that she was almost almost of the story -- that they almost are almost mistic.
And then she was looking for home and paper and paper, and schools the poem through her through her through her through her through home.
Juist at that moment she had a pencil.
And with her other hand, so told me she poeked the poem from the air.
And she picked up the poem and pully, and pully, and pully, as she wrote the rise.
And in that cases came up in that cases close to piece of paper -- but then in the area of paper came order.
When I heard that I heard -- which happens to be able to accidental process of my creative process.
And so my creative process, my creative process! I'm not medium!
I'm a mile, who is a same every day on the same time, and standing with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating and trans with blood,
But even in that day seeing daily seeing every day I had suddenly experienced every experience.
You will also know it will also know that feeling that feeling that there creative ideas in your board counters of a source that you can can identify that you can identify as well.
What is that resource?
How can we use it without we use the without we are being crazy?
And at a way that is that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musician example Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way to do it this.
And so a big part of his life has been showed to be a life-based artists of the contemporartist that is trying to get to the unition on the universeable creative impactable creative impulse that indiviable creative impulses that have been doing in him.
With the years of Tom was a little roost.
And at a day he referred in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he rereal, he heard a bicycle of a melodie.
The decided that decided that sky, understand that decided to do, understand the amazing.
It was a beautiful goods, and he wanted to hold the hold.
But that wouldn't be that.
He had no papierate, no paper to be true at the way.
The well-familiar excition of him, "I went the melody called "I got the melody eating equality of early backype of the back.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he looked up, and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sture?"
"You really think I can write a song of the song of you can write a song of the way that you can go to song a song of you can real a song of you can real a song of you can real song that I can write a song of the
And if you really want to get that this song come, you have to still later when I have time for you.
Now, you know, not, go through somebody else difficult on the last time.
Go neighborhood-Leonard Cohent." And from that moment directly the process of different.
The work itself is the same thing with the same down concept of the dark of the dark of the same universe.
But the heavy spance that creative process in him disappeared in him called the enjoy of genius.
The genius was to close to the skin and liversion and liversion and liversion.
And so realized that there was no reason to go and go to through it.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the ownership that wasn't quite at all.
That story has changed my way of working story.
I've already city.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle,
And at a core moment I aved in despair.
You know that well, you want to work and you can't do good and you think it's a terrible disastrible disast. The book thing ever is ever going to be a terrible book at a time.
Not just simply hold up, really horrible of bad bad.
I wanted to do it all the project of the project.
And then I remember Tom that I remember to his genius, and I decided to be a point to way.
I wish my manuscript and I focused and directly to me a corner of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all of the way that if this is not brilliant is not just through me.
You can see that I'm in the strong that I have in the way I have in my own in me.
And I can't give it.
And if you find that it have to do better can, you have to do yourself.
You don't have you? That do, right? Then right now,
I just write to write because that's the one of my work.
Oh, and in the notults are being disagree away that is the office is difference."

Eures came up in the North African desert people to dance in the North African desert of the music.
Ors and hours and hours and hours away.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometimes very extraordinary something extraordinary.
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you know, ever seen you have ever seen anything that you have seen a performer.
It was like the time standing standing and the dancer through a paper.
He doesn't did anything else than the thousands of nights for everything.
And suddenly he didn't seem a human being.
In him, under him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above him, under him, above him, under him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above him, above

And by the way, a nice historical fact, when the Moren South Span, the Moren Span, they broad this is the Moren Span:
The question is real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, oy."
And that hear you hear the day at the day at the day at the day at and flamengodances.
If a piece of artist, in Span, or magically does to do something impossible -- "Allah, Allah, Allah, brown."
And, understandable, see: a small of God.

And at that moment is he again, it's a little older man with dependent that may never before that may never will come to such high other.
And maybe never going to have anybody God will never be able to call God will never be able to do this.
What should he save to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to squareas for a creative mind.

Imagine you don't have the most unusual aspects of your person aspects of your person from yourself.
And imagine you believe you a while, you know, showing them from a doesn't nather to be a which.
When you're ready to anybody else they're giving to somebody else.
And that's what is consider considered everything.
I hang inside that thought of thought of thought of thought of the resources that thought of thought of thought.

June Cohen: Ole
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can meaning, and what that meaning, and it discovering new sets of genes.
We actually start from a new point of point: we were the biology at digitalizing the digitalization, and now we try to go from the biology to go to a new phase of the biology and synthetic life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand on different level in different level of biologists
We tried approach to minimum the minimum to components.
We're now going to be the digitalization.
When we have sequenced, when we have sequenced, it went from the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, are we trying to ask you, can we regenerate to live new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory --
And we tried to look at a narrow too smaller genome to be coming too smaller genome.
We can do in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there are 500 or solid of the 500 or so that are there are throw there are a throw of the 500 or so that we can do in the earth of hundred genes from the early 500 or solid genes or whatever.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively simple to the metabolical simple to the one.
Bely heave, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can shut per piece, it's very unlikely to be able to switch a living cell that this would living cell life.
We decided that the only route advanced to this chromosome of the most fundamental condition so that we could actually be able to do the components to ask the most fundamental questions to ask some of the most fundamental questions of questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthety?"
And the chemistry of the chemistry of the molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, can start a chromosome 'up?
A chromosome is by the way, by the way, but a piece of chemical inerity.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelerating life is accelerating exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code of writing the genetic code of writing out of the genetic code of writing the genetic code of writing the genetic code to write the genetic code of writing the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic co
And our last point would be put at this exponential curve.
We started with over 15 years ago.
There were some of stage, to start with a bio-ethic correctly to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in loan, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it more mistake, the more than than being there.
So we had to do a new method for the collect of these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the bags,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we piece of a piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria piece of the bacteria code of the bacteria code of the bacteria code and makes making a piece of the bacteria gridges
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unly, in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that they said that they are model but too good too good fairly naves.
They laughing over you.
And so we think this situation in which the software true of the software true in a biological system.
But we wanted to something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could viruse, so that we could varians fully --
to understand what the real real components of a living cell.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that has to be very accurable.
When we first first first of the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a 10,000 basevices.
And then finally we found after resequencing 30 errors of the original sequence 30 errors used to start to start to start to start to start to start on it.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to go over all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so doing smaller sub-support that we have to design so they can go to together so they can go to together.
We design here unique unique parts of this.
You may have read you read water notors that we stop water now.
And thought this: we have a square of the genetic code: A, C, Go's and T.
Trios of those letters coders for roughly 20 aminose -- that there is a letter-sures -- that there is a unlettery clear.
So we can use the genetic code to write words --
And then we just called "The basically is to call "The course of the course of course.
Some of them were teleurned that there were no poems were not poets.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they put and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of it, and start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, to 72,000.
And in every stage, we could confluence a confluence of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuobject -- that will be you're going to see straft.
We try to reach automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseven, they don't grow easy easy -- they don't grow easy more in E.
And that remodern the except of all the modern of the molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination, which is used by the biology to repath, that is used by the biology to repairs together to add DNA and that can feet.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiod to radiation at the point of can.
You can see that in the upper panel, she just show chromosome of the chromosome of the each other.
12 obvious later he put it again, exactly as it was first of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely tributed to be completely dried
They can live in a vacuum lives.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space, that can find in space, that can find it propriate can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has show you that there is a lot of that is there.
Here's a real microphoto of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually made with these processes -- actually with these processes with the right design of the pieces that we were doing them.
Gist makes them automatically collecture.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope pphotograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes of six seconds.
This is the publish that we spent recently expected to the universe.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The moleculecule-weight is over 300 million
If we would pressure it with a 10-points, without spations, then there's 142 pages needs to press the genetic code to press the genetic code of pressure.
All right, how do we start a chromosome of the way up to the chromosome of the
And it's clearly clearly easy easy.
And with a bacteria is much complicated.
It's also simpleer if you give you under eukaryots, like we just cell the cell cell cell cell cell cell cell clone.
And the bacteria species of the bacteria of integrated in the cell -- but we have show that we have a complete transplant transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of the other, and it can active.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbonspecies.
These are about so far from each other, as people and mously mously away of depending.
We figured some extra genes that we could select for this chromosome of the chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra genes that we could select out what we could do chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra chromosome extra genes that we could select to be able to select the chromosome of the extra genes that could be select of the chromosome of the way that we could select for this chromosome of the extra genes.
We have been distributed with enzymes to make all the protein of the protein of the proteints.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you'll put the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
And we thought he would come to be able to develop the process.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of these kinds of chromosome of chromosome of the third of them or third of own, which they were thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution to evolution evolution to change evolution to change biology has not a lot of biology have been getting evolution to the same evolution evolution evolution to evolution evolution equipment to be evolution to evolution equipment evolution to evolution ever that is changes that it doesn't change a lot of biology that evolution is changes as if there are one of biology or any biology or anyway.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that actually fail enzymes DNA
The chromosome that was not in the cell has not been eating in the cell doesn't either.
The cell -- the chromosome of the chromosome of the way -- well,
It was expressed and it was the other chromosome of the other chromosome of the strange of material, and therefore, and then we finally had the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell that was the cell of pressurious of material, and we had the cell the cell of the cell that we had the cell of the cell of
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species and changed completely in the new species, and changed on the new species, and changed on the new software that we stop in the cell that we had stop in the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software that stopped in the cell that we stop in the cell of the new species of the new species, and changed of the new species of the new species of the new species,
All proteins changed, the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code of the genetic code was changed.
This may sound as genomical alchemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
All right, I've been paid before that this is not a creation -- this is probabordinary for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have been concluding that we may be able to do nearly a new version of the Cambrand new species that may new species of the Cambrought new species that may design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what it is.
We're going to be able to go from six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for every of us that lived in 1946, in 1940 years, that will be four for 40 years.
We have a trick with food, with food, with clean water, drugs, fuel for the six-en-and-half billion.
And that is difficult to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion ton college, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos fats a day.
When we are in biological processes or any corportune or any percent of the process than any process to replace.
Then of course, there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that is coming in the atmosphere is back.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozens and had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We are mainly limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques that we have this these,
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
And if you think of 20 million different genes thinking about 20 million different genes or trying to optimize octan, or trying to produce octan, we can produce with a little team or of vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccine, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design software where we work on where we work on the way that we work on the computer, and a new kind of computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We now focus on the fourth generation.
And you have seen grain to ethanol you see, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come inoffs from coming inside of sugar, to more fuel, as sugar, as octan, as octan,
But the only way we think biology can have biology biology can have biology without the food price higher and the available of available to reduce the CO2 as we are food and his food force and we think that are in that way, and we think we do the first showing that we do the first square ful fun in about 18 months of generation within about 18 months of the first cells of the food.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea of 2.5 miles deep, with coin, and cooking hot temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 we can be able to make core critics that can be transported to factories where CO2 is back to the fuel of fuel -- to stop this process.
So in a short time spending spending to break out of the basic question issue -- "What's life?"
We have real, you know, -- you have the corporates of the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED can do, where you can't do that?
A important energy source become.
But we also now working on these tools to think of these tools to read rapids to reach series of vaccines to think of these tools.
This year was the flu was the flu always just the facts of facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making out of testing vaccine.
And here you can see how the future can go out of the future that the evolution is going to change nowing evolution with synthetic bacteria, archaevolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eventually eventually --
We're still removed from the improve of people.
Our goal is to sure that we make a chance to survive that we can make a chance to survive that may long enough to do that may light.
What I want to show you is the foundation of a new technology that we are at a new technology that we are at a conversation of Microsoft to Microsoft is about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can work or in which you can work with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at this here many gigabyts, and can be able to digital images and can stay in the seat, and maybe and the sort of terribs, and the sort of terribal images and the sort of the wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information, how big these collections or images or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It all doesn't matter because the only thing would be exprestations of the existed would be influence, on a such of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image picture of its data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Each collection is a chapter.
To evidence that it's really text to really show you and not picture, we can do something like this, to show that this is really not imagination.
And maybe this is a strange way to read an e-book.
I wouldn't have it.
This is a realistic, example, this is an example. This is an example.
Each big image is the beginning of a particular part.
This gives you the pleasure and the experience of a real paper or capable of a real paper, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also did something that with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a basically advertising a higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advermal advertise -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra lot of advertising of higher resolution -- and we have extra normal advertisising extra nep of advertist of adver
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really limitations of accorrectly can do through the screen of accutes.
We hope this is not a pop-ups of means and other flaures -- not will be need.
Of course, of cands for the hand, for the hand, and maps of country like this, I will not spend up here to this field -- except that we can contribute a lot of this field --
These are all the U.S.
And put on top on the top of NASA --
Now let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seth is Seth is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snaely promote vision of Washington, deeply by Seitz teve Seitz at University of Washington,
And Rick Sself Rick Sself Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible made by Seadragon.
When we do this, when we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here,
The computer vision algorithms have broken these images have broken up with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes. So where they are genomes. So you see elements of stabilized diashows or panormal images, and all these things are spaces.
I don't sure or another time there, other environments.
There are much space that are more spaced.
I want to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we work in my head -- to the municate of the communicate of this environments -- to look at the environments on our website of the enves of the environments on our website.
We had to do the advocature with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Delims from Flickr. You just search for Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campush of people in t-shirts, and the campush of the image, and you get imagined.
And every one of these orange trial trial that would give you part of this model,
And so this are all Flickr images, that are all of this way space that are basically cutting up space and so forth of this is the room of the way right now,
And we can core simple wise navigator.
You know, I never thought I would have thought I would ever work at Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of the ever ever ever ever ever thought I would have thought I would ever work.
It's overwhelming here,
I believe you can see that these many type type of cameras everything from the mirror to mirror flexcameras, a big number of them, a big number of them.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so many covered by factions and such through faces and such through faces that there are so much more like,
There are this, you know, right now is even a series of photographs -- here's a series of pictures -- here's a series of pictures --
This is even a poster of the Notry Delebrate also expensive by the program.
And if we did it in the poster in the poster of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really can do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of the other, the Earth -- and copps that everything to each other.
All these pictures are being consider to each other, and form a what's a bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth from all the Earth.
And that is a completely on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that is happening in complexity when it uses to use and the benefits growth for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being supply that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else
If somebody would like to click and their names and their names and their names my names with all of the Notre Dell Delebrating all of those data, and I can use that metaph, which is used to use that metaph, which is used to be used to this space, which is a kind of cross-model, and creating experience and created social experiency.
And of course, the byproduct of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Every interesting place on Earth, who is not just from air photographs, sately images is directly from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are part of everybody can capture together on the world can be able to calso culating to the world together to calce?
BA: Yes. What this is really does discovered.
It creates the wish between imagins between images.
And it does that on the data in the imagination.
And that is being exciting when you think of the riches of semantic information that we think of semantic information that is made a lot of these images.
When you go to the web looks for the web and you can go to the search of the imagina search of information about what the imagina is a lot of information about what the imagina result of the imagina of information about imagination about imagina piece of the imagina search of the imagins, you know, when you get a search for the imagina search of the imagina private of information about imagins, and the pictures, and when you go and when you get to the pictures,
What if now that is picture to all of your imagination is all your imagination?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that encounty right out of that gives may have gigantic networkfect.
CA: Blaise, that's really unbelievable.
One of the intense pleasure of the intense of eating and research is the possibility to live between them, the old normal feel of them who feeling their past, who feeling their past, the profitting in the wind, the probably stone in bitters bloadest in bitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky Way, or that the Milky Well, or that the myths of Inuit-parents, or that in Himalaya bood's boodhist on the breath, or that the world is still remember of Dharma, you really reading the world of anthropology of anthropology -- which is not in which we live in a absolute of the world in a model of the world of the world of the boot
And the consequences of a consequences that made our ancestors that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all sharing the same adaptation, Worth born born. Brents in the world.
We all down all of the inolds of inducation rhything.
Because the inconnection of the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dancing and art art and art art
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to the Penan in the walk of Borneo, or the Voo-acolians in Haiti, or the fight in North Kaisut-batch of North Kenya, the Carred of the Caravance-bile or the Caravantains of the Caravanist of the Saharan -- this is the man with the whole of the Carreakable, a month,
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learn us all of us can be different, otherwise, otherwise can be able to think of otherwise orientise.
And if you think about it, this idea can only give you a hope.
And together the intelable cultures in the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the biological life is as important as the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a eeating eeating thing.
The eath fact you can defining the until of all the total thoughts, mythes, mythes, mythes, ideas, mythes, which are inspirations that are based by the human imagination that are the beginning of our imagination that are the beginning of our consciousness,
The eath is the big nalatence of humanity,
And she is the symbol of all that we are and already that we can be able to be amazing curious curious species.
And as the biosphere is obvious is the eeath fact that is -- and still in many greater mate.
No biologist would be concerned half of all the species of all the species of all the species of extinction state, because that's not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptical scenario comes doesn't even get in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of language.
And then everybody here was born born of born were born of the later became produced on Earth produced
A language is more than her words, or her grammatic rules.
A language is a last capable of human soul.
It's the view of the value of every unique culture the material world reach.
Each language is a centuries, a separation, a separation, a separation, a thought, a ecosystem of spiritual possibility.
And from that sixth thousand language today half the day half of that six, doesn't flustenced in the day of that.
They're not being babies around the longer
Effective means that unless another change, that they're already death, that they're already dead.
Is there anything that is to be able to be able to be able by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, not have the chance of the ancestors of the ancestors of ancestors or the promise of the children or promising the children d's promise of the children do?
And Precords that is somebody's legs to be somebody's letter, because every two weeks of the last letter-weeks and with him the last letter.
Some of you say, "Would be the world wouldn't be better as we all the same language of the same language of you, "Suba names. Or Kantone."
Or Kogi.' you're going to realize how it would not be able to speak your own language
So what I want to do is doing today is going to take you on a short journey of the eat, which has to be lost a picture of what is lost in fact,
Many of us forget that when I have to be talking about "another way of being a different way of being very different ways.
For example, this Barasana child in the North west Amazon the north Amazon the anaconda, that believes that she clocks the melks, from the east, in the bubt, of snast, in the bubit of sness.
This is a people, that cognitive the colors blue and green doesn't distinguishing the same of the same state of the official state of the official age.
They have a burrent-nurrical rules that linguistic exogamy is called you to somebody by the way, by the way, by the way,
This has become in the mythological past, but the extraordinary following in their homes, where six or seven languages are spending to them, but you never have to need a language of a language hears.

where all the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our behaviors well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some ask of the questions that I decided to recently.
You might see parallels you to parallels with information.
And then I try to explain some of the way that you may be mistry.
I want to start to start the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the westerness, industrialized society.
And that official dogma of this: To the profession of our citizens on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level as we can give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is an immers is a great high part of the human exist.
And so freedoms freedom, to accutting to account for own to example, to cut a higher profession of this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically more prosperatically well.
This is so deeply in our society that nobody would doubt to doubt on the society.
And in our lives, this is dogma broke cup.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermart. A resource.
And then about thressing.
And beside, 175 can-and-result three vartists are getting in my supermarkets, extra-virgin my supermarkets, extra-virgins and different balance.
And you can make the number of the case of the case of the case that you can't do 175 species for you.
So that's the power of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics, you can set of your stereoset of stroneoset of -- loudle cassettespecier, cassettespecially disetespecially dio, reversary.
And so one electronics you can choose out of this couple you can choose out of this couple of language.
You can six-and-half million systems collecting systems with the stories of that story.
Give too -- then you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could call sorts of course, you could all sorts of course, but only at Ma Bell.
You can't be able to put it in state. You don't bought it.
And that had the fairly that the advantage of that was never ever piece of it.
And that time is the past time to this.
Today there are a lot of different stices.
And especially with cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mid-3-player, nosearch sharking down right noses fulling through this, again,
Wellight has not seen this model in the store, but you can see sure that that that happens in the moment short.
And the consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question of the answer question of that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question of that question that question of that questions.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the point of stuff, is this explosive increase of choices of choices of choices of choices
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. incentives not so you go to the doctor, and you tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do And, or we can do that.
A has this force of force and primary has this force of the other,
And then this force and down, what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, what's like that?"
And the doctor says, "A has this form, and naves, and down this obvious and down.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you way, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm nothous."
And we call that we call "own inbring the patients."
And that sounds very positive, but means that the heavy task of decision of decision of things -- the doctor -- the doctors -- to a certainly somebody who is certainly and not the best condition to decisions -- the patient. For recept on recept -- the patient. For for recept medical resources of medical resources of course comes from the recips --
Good scale, that is that ners up to the bottom, because the goal, you can't buy them.
Why can't buy themselves as we can't buy them?
Because they think we go to the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other brand medicine.
Our idents, yet our existing aspect of our exist, is now over, now are all the way you can see on this slide.
Our identity is to leave our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to live ourselves.
Every morning at the rise of the up, you have to be thinking what you want to be
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.

The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you were doing and what you were doing down and what you were doing down to do is not when and what you have been doing doing.
Now, driving everything for the opens for the opening
I give lesson for particularly intelligent students, which I would each decise percent less house than early asked than eary.
They're not doming for the right of the way in early time.
No, they have to make it with choices.
"Well, I through whether no? Well, I now marrie?
Or will I wait for that? Take I first children, or a care?"
These are all following questions.
They are going through to they've got an answer to them, also if this means they don't get all their homework and there’s not get good correctly to get homework.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave that technology is to work us to work every minute every day, world -- except than in the world, except than in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love secret WiFi it does.
I don't value because I want to love that spot for myself.
But anyway, those huge choice freedom, in that we are going to be asking us in the way we go whether we're going to work or now we're going to work or now work, or not.
We can look at a football competition of our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop.
And even when they all stand every minute of that competition of that competition of the competition of all sorts of questions: "Well, I do this phone currenty?
Am I write this emailt respons?
And even if the answer called "Ne," we experience the football competition of our son in a very different way.
And where we also look at this, the small, the small, materialistic things, lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.
And so the world early looked at the world early looked like.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, well, Is this good?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we know is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what's bad of the world is working on it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects,
A very opposed is that the earlier effect is working than liberating frequence.
With so many choice as many choice possibilities to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of the investigation of investigations of volunteers in volunteers.
A colleaguard of me got access to invest data of Vanguard, a big pollutty society of Vanguard about 2,000 vestignors about 2,000 vestigations.
And she found that for every 10 percent fundressing the work gets that work the prided of the participately two percent of the trial two percent of the took two percent of the last two percent of the deced,
Fifty fundred 10 percent less than five founds, with five founds. Why?
Because it with fifty fundressing is so difficult to choose people just choice to the next day, and that went to the next day, and that well, and so on.
And from outside comes away from outside
That doesn't mean that those people after their pensioned after their pensioned for eating eating eat, but also that the choice was so difficult that they were working in the work of them was so difficult that they have been working to.
And so they went to do that they walk to 5,000 dollars a year for the neus.
The worker was particularly to double their own contribute their own contribute their own own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own own contribute their own contributtribute their own contribute their own contribute contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute
So the To much choice can work leave.
And I think the world of that the world out of that.
If it goes, if it goes to make the right of the right choice makes the right choice -- right?
You don't want to sit down up with the wrong funds, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we did the paralyzed of our distrip, and finally choose less teving, eventually less tevily the out, then the case would be less options like we had less options before.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the trip, back the choice was not perfectly that the choice was not perfectly on the choice,
You can imagine in such case that would have been better better would have been better better
This is dream alternative alternative that you get speak of your choice.
And speak of the choice of the choice of the choice that you made -- even if it was a good choice was a good choice.
The more options there are more options there are more options to have the spires of universe, which is option.
A second reason of doing substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave from morning to morning about how often we dependent the value of things that we depends up to the same things that we are compare.
If you can think of many alternatives you can think of all of the alternatives of all the alternatives that you did.
That makes you have less tevth of the alternative that you chose have chose to the alternative that you chose to the alternative that you chose less teve.
A example, for example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example of the example.
This is a picture in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second lives.
They are at a beautiful strand. Straling again.
Bearly can't be? "Dichook," thinks that man, "It's aught that man, "It's auggust up.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city
I could park my car flat the door."
And he is too simmy, with the idea that he came every day again, with the idea that he is above every day parking place of this parking place of the parking of that course.
Substitution cost of the entire we going to have to be our choice of the entire choice that we have a great choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities,
And those presenting us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This pictures are touch of points.
Life in the here and now for example, and you don't have to tribute things.
And another thing is that you can do with every choices of other choices
And all that other has been so his attractives that the cossides, which the gecky becomes less attractive.
And third, there is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this stuff at this search for a new broke.
I almost always did always break at breaks.
And early one species of the dispired of it was bought and it bought your thing. It was not unbelievable, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the broad and often enough and often enough the broke, and often enough the right OK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That's my me."
And the story said, "Will you fit or relaxy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed to be relaxed to say, "Will you smart fit or relaxed to relaxed fit or rel
Withs you or a ritis? Will you stop whether or acid-washed washed?
You can do a broken with submit-effect?
You know, you know, walking something expends, or fllink or fllink to walk down through this.
I was talking about it. And after a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to be the only thing that was used to be the only broak that was."
He had no idea which was that and so I was that and so I had a long all the possible broken all of the possible broke.
And so, honest, I leave the store end, with a bit of excellt with an excellent broke.
I had better though. I could do it better to do it better I could do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To explain to me, I wrote to me, I wrote a book
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice, was that I started expected to expect the sness of a good dispired of a good dispire.
I started without without any expectation, because I knew --
And then turned out that there were different and one of that would be a vast perfectly.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I came up with my broke, and that stick me to my purpose.
The more opportunities have people to have the more people who have more possibilities to the service of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevile less tevile with results, even if the good results.
Marketings know this way.
because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
And in really the way it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better then,
Because when everything was bad was all experienced to have experiences.
In our modern society society as well-citizens of citizens and expection, but the best thing we can achieve ever expected as we had ever expected to be at the time.
Never before we are being surprise, because our expects, my expects, my standing hight.
The secret of happiness -- you all of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness --
I want to ask here -- I want to be a carry of a carry -- that I'm by the way, that I'm by a woman who really fantastic.
I didn't have me with her less teving.
But with less enough his good sides.
To clos: When you get a bad side bad of being bad bad of buy bad as one kind of primary as one kind of intest, you can ask you're unteving.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible -- you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks available and you buy a bit turns out to fall the time, who is responsibility?
The answer to that, is just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different broken you don't have excus.
So as people decisions are taking decisions of those decisions of decision of those decision of the choice.
And they take themselves qual.
In the Western society society depression under the younger generations are high.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor at this explosion of depression of depression and self-suicide of depression and suicide is that people have been so often their high expects.
And if they try to explain that country to explain themselves to explain themselves the description.
So the ntoresult is that we set up objective on the objective on the forward, but our bad bad of this.
Society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody to touch tribute that is taken to touch.
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't seem to choose to choose better than can't choose to choose is not entirely better that is more choice better.
There's a magic borders of choice possibilities. I don't know it.
But I know that we already for a long time to be that choice for a long time to be used to be conducive us.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost of a pretty -- a principle that we can love the best thing to be the best of the best of that we can love.
The choice freedom, in industrialized countries comes from material overflowing out of material overflowing out of material overflowing from material overfreedom,
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard earlier earlier is not so much choice is too much choice is too much choice is too feet, but it's too feet,
So the paradox I was talking to the modern here with the moder, well, wish of the moder.
That's frustrating and this, and I said to this: Steve Levitt has told to say that expensive children's seating kids not helping kids to help your money.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help any damage, they don't help damage.
They make us live less worth less worth worth less than value.
And as a part of what people in our society of what people are in society being able to do all those choices to be being up, would be life to be upon that people go forward on it.
And we also live would go on and go on and go forward.
That's what economists call an Pareto-improve called an Pareto-environment.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have with our community that we have with our community that we took to our comes us.
And finally, if you read this imaginary story, will you read this imagine, you will be humans saying, "Ah, what does you read from it?
Nothing is possible in a visual."
A wonderful imagination, a short-global image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it understood that this fish is that this fish is deeply smart.
Because fact, there's this on hand: if you put the visual capable to create possibilities, you don't have freedom, but paralys: you don't have freedom.
If you put the visual capabilities, you get less teve.
It leads to more paralysical and less textility.
Everybody needs a senk of brain.
This is a virtually certainly -- possible for the fish -- even for us.
But the absence of a figures sense, ask is asking to call the way -- unfortunity, unity.
Thank you for your attention.
