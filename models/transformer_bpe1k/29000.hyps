And I show this two slight these two slight of the policy cap, which is the pollut three million year, about the size of the U.S. Come of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this disinculated the next of this specific problem because it doesn't show the ice of ice.
The ice capital climate system is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the summer, and crack in the summer.
The next slide, I shows a accelerated version of what happens 25 years happened 25 years happened.
The permanence, the permanentire in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blued.
That's the year, that's the equired of the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years, is almost like five years, is almost like flower, that from the body's five here.
In 25 years is the from this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen fresources around the North Ice, and there's a very big amount and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon cool that is increase in methan, when it is deated by microbe, microbes in methane.
Compull-resources in the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, it could double the amount of the amount of the crite of the crite of the crite of the crite of the slow.
In some of the indeep of the whole of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska team to another undeep me.
Whoo! Well, it's OK. The question is the question is that we will be going to be
A reason for that, is that this huge warmber "warmbon" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell of smell of this.
The water volume is the bigger than ever ever ever ever
This is the Kangerly, river in South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea pile, because it is clear, because it is the country where it comes in the sea coming in the sea.
These streams are taking down.
On the other side of the planet, on the South polite of the South polite mass on Earth.
And last month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now a negative imaginent now is a negative imagine balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole very quickly very quickly called a few called a few couple of the same islands.
The whole continent is for six meters of six feet of furious of slide.
In the Himalaya, the two after the size of the ice mass, there are now new now, that was a few years ago, there were other glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that smelt time.
In the Andes, is this glass this glass for this city.
There are now more stream.
But when they disappear, it disappears to drink water.
In California was a four percent in California in the snow page of the Sierra.
It really comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read it, the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dream has led to a dramatic stycumber fire.
And the number of nature, of course, the currency and never never seen an incredible and never never seen any speeed.
Four more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unrelated to be completely unlike this.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 --
25 mixed ton every day in our oceans, and look at the east five of the Stille of Ocean, from America, west, and at every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drawing of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, next to the Earth, next to 20 percent money, is the burning of fossil fuel of fossil fuel goods.
Oil is a problem, and voice is a problem, and it's all the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extenstituters, so, with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot of more urban centrals.
But we see a course.
These are the suppose of the building that the building was the last years, and where green alternatives were forgetting in the last years, and where green alternatives were represented to the last years.
There's a political battled to the gang in our country.
The suburban and oil industire gave ingetting carbon dollars to promotly, which is a clear, which is a country of cool cool --
And that picture to something like this.
And Rond the Christ, at me in Tennesse, about four billion gallons of liter billion gallons of liter county of moneyes.
You probably have seen the news of the news.
This is the only size of one after the size of the size of America.
This happened around the Cerst.
One of the advertisist cool around the Kerstrikes was the Kerstrike.
Video: "Well, the cool cool is a blank guy is a black guy's a stay certain.
He is overfluence in America, and he makes it makes our economy grows on it.
The frosty cups cle, with the day clean.
He is paid and cumble and cutting their job."
Here is a big part of the cool in West Virginia frun.
The biggest mine of the country is the great biggest of Massey Coal.

We think it's clean -- and it is -- and it still a clean.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me just leave us over.
Video: Acteur: Schone carbon heard of it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean city-cle-city-cle-citity-cle-cle-cities.
Fantastic! The machines make some lawyers a little bit of law.
But that's the sound of sound clean cool technology.
And though the fact that burning cities of cool one of the most important causes of the Earth, is changed the earth, changes the remarkable cool technology that you see here.
Look good around, this is the clean around clean technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually pitive alternative alternative alternative alternative alternational security of national security --

The red wire crazy in all of these bags, is our dependency fuel of fossil coals, like pollution and inmported oil.
But now there's a during solution to this.
And before America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan America plan America work to the work of the Earth, and the opinion of the Earth.
Eventually a solution that is a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontdeck hold.

Al Gore: There's an old African speak that says, "If you want to be going to be going to be going to go and says, "If you want to be all of it.
If you want to go and go and say."
We have to go and speed.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here's me. For those of you who weren't there, the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever suppossible experiment in the critical experiment in the critical experiment in the one.
It has to be the conditions that were presentation that were less than a billion on a billion times a billion times a second second to 600 million times a second.
Enorm called ambition!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS.
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLAS.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was genomes by ATLAS.
That made a party called a party-clean-camer.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all the LHC good at all, and with operating up with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture photograph on 10 September ber that the machine works, which is a huge exactly --
I don't know if this is the biggest the biggest of the biggest of this, when someone was someone to Google, and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a both of a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make it with these golden carries.
Those days, 13 thousand thousand camper resources the machine on full power to full the machine on full power resources of the machine resources of the machine on the full power resources of the machine on the full remove.
The engineers under you will say, "Not where. It's too small this."
They can do that because they superceither superceither of temperature temperature
So at the min 271 degrees the stars, colder than the stars, that can close the stars, that can be drags that stream.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a construction.
And that was that it was something warmer, and it was something that was electric wear, and electric weather thousand amper resource.
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realize your realize that magnets more than 20 tons of the tons of the tool.
We decivilized about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them when we all tool.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We'll be up to the purpose and we expect measures in Juni, so we can go up with the except of what the buildings of the universe.
Now, of course, that have that unhappy in the debate of the value of scientific research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to go beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, during the devalence, during experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous of the progress than reprogressive on of the human mind of science that there are no mysterions that there are no reds of the definitions of the response, that are not anysteries are completely that we are completely including our reading the whole in the scious."
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you back to your childhood to your kids when you play with blocks and played with blocks.
When you discovered how to understand how you had to understand how you had to be able to learn with the learn of the learn of the country with and hanters of space relationship.
Ruimtell you is a strong because with the understanding of the world.
If a information -- I started by the nururture of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- and my medicular pated with my advisore and my medicately -- I started to ask -- what if we were a computer place -- what if we could use a computer mosing in a plate plate as a kind of digital fingured in a plate plat a plate finger plate that we can information figure out of a plate with a place fyed information fyclase fireauth,
and can orders and as we want?
This question that question is that we decided that we decided to search by Siftables.
Siftile is a Siftile a Siftly a smooth,
They can be moving with the hand they can be movement to each other, their movement and they detect a screen and small contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical accutblocks they can be moving through there.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
Before this resources a more physical difference, and even more physical difference, and even of the way we movement and even of the way we move, there are different new and we are produced, there are different new and we live interactions and figure out of the new and real interactions of the way we have to discovered.
I'll start with some simple example of the simple examples.
This Sift: This Sifty is to show a video classes, that plays, and othershed and others;
These interactive portraits are awarenessary.
And in the next next to each other, they will be interest.
And if they came up with it and they can also be what they can be suppossible thoutside.
And so much they feel movement and hell.
We algay realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the using of all of the interaction, as it was a color was a liquid of a color was a liquid --
In this example three Siftable, and I can use them to close color in a leg, where they get to a pick up with a leg, where they get to a pick up with a legact of the example of the example of the example of the example in this example in a picture in this example of the example of the example of the examp
And if we have covered what we have to go back to what back back.
There are some cleletting some clever, massive with language, mathematics with language, math, math, math, math, and logical that we want to give things to be rapidly, and the result of the result of education.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci of a simple calculating programmmmic.
Here we show you a game that a cross-crable and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every single letter around a letter letter to every Siftable, and send words are control in a words.
And after about 30 seconds it is going to reshake a new series of letters with a new series of letters with means of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in it to leave them to make it and I love it to make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly have no instructions,
Everything you have to say is "Make words, and they know what to do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our youngest blota tester, right?
And it seems that he just single the Siftables whatever you pile.
For him for him to this is just blocks.
Here is an interactive painting showing painting
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftill of the Siftill of the table.
Here it is the sun of the sun of sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good does dan! Yeah!
And by shift Siftables and the next to place each other, he can respond to each other, with each other,
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it walks.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today, Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have every Siftable, where every Siftables like the lead, like the lead, and drum.
English has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to do you to us.
And these sounds can be increased in Siftables so that you can be injected to paltern.
You place a sound in the pattern of a least, in a pattern of a leg Siftill live controlllably as reverble age and filter.
They are to a sound of sound and advanced by side.
And the general effects like tempo and completely that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead. We're starting with a lead.
And now I place the basline --
Video: Well, I feed some baghtly work
Video: Well, I couldn't put the filter on the drums, so I can infect live live in the effect live of the drums,
Video: I can accelerately it by the office of the tempo block of the tempo block you.
Video: Well, I came the filter of the basic for what more expression.
Video: Well, I can repeating it pattern while it plays.
I don't have to any anything to plann, but I can improvise it all a lot of core and corter like I want.
With the dims of the dims of the whole through the full Siftill to left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people, and I will work better interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces our brain.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of course of course, with some of the course, that we are in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the count of the attack is to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it with you to go with you with you all and talk to you all with you to all of you all with you with you all and you get to you with you with you all and you get to you all with you and I look at it with you
I'm writing writing this.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My life long life long for a long time, and I don't think that ever will change it.
And yet there is something in my life in my life and career in my life, and career and career with my relationship with my relationship.
It started with a book that I wrote understanding until I wrote a memoire: "Eten, Biddle, that very except to my first work and a international exciting the entire world and a international existence was the entire world and a international existence.
The consequence is that people now all the time, all the time, as if I do down.
Well, what -- you know, does it bet!
People come to me and ask me to me and ask me to me, "Don't you never bang you will never ever be evalen?
Don't you couldn't afraid you keep your whole life is going to be published a book that people will be able to get heaval?
You don't have anything to that?"
Every single reasonable, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I remember 20 years ago, I was when I write a teenage -- if I write told that I write I write write I write write for a teenage -- I was write a teenage -- I was when I write a teenager,
People said, "Don't you never afraid you never get success?
Don't you courage for dependence, you will go through it down?
Don't you afraid you live to this work without of this without there is something from the broken and you will strong in the public of dream with your broken dropping your bitters of bitters of fail?"
Something in that strike.
And in the short comes to this questions that questions questions of this, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things that are called things that are called things being called things being called things that are called things being called things become called things that are called the things that are called things that are called the things that are called things are called these things that are called things are called the things that are called the
Always the ways of the time.
But I'm also much other things that you have a lot of other things that all of all of the things that all of all of the time.
For example, for example, and other sings.
But what I writing writing myself the last time that fears from, where that fear.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that someone capital that is to be bang for the work for the work for the work of the Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of it in the mind of the minds, something that is not going to do all the work of the work work all the work that is not happened to the way that we do not happens to the effect of the minutes of the minds, which is not going to be so particularly
Tather. He was a father. He was skull, and I can't remember that there was a single for 40 years that he was working someone in the 40 years of it was not afrather for it.
And so of "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, it didn't work about it.
To be fair to be fair to be engineers have been reputation by the centuries, also not the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
Sup, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputation mental cumble of the reputational instability.
Look at the grimmy death, the most magnificance-magnificancy creative spire of the 20th century.
Many of the still of young, often by own own own own own own own own own own own own own own through own own own own through own the own of own died own own own young, often through own the own of own young, often through itics.
And even those of those who don't have self-myself moment, under their gave gave hold to their gave gave me.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mek of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of these invite exciting the way we don't look at it.
We've all heard it before and have it heard and have it all accepted.
The critical thought is that creativity is that creativity is inded with suffering and that an artist will lead to call of an artist will lead to anyway.
So I want everyone here today, you can ask today: You can alive that idea life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think I agree, I think I don't think it all the way I think it doesn't thought it all the way at all.
I think it reframe.
And also, even dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century that this is going to be like this.
We can creative spire a lot better to live sports to live space.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, would be dangerous to that dark though.
See the fase where my career in which my career now
You're just going to be young, I'm young, amper says,
I can maybe I can work four decades work.
Home probably will probably anything I'll get to the outside world as the world as it work that extraordinary succcessful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can friend: higher probably succcess, my biggest succcess for behind me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you go and think, you're going to think, you're in the morning hour on the drank.
So I don't want to that.
I love to the work I love with the work I love to the work I love of the work I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love.
The question is, "Do won?"
And after long after the conclusion I can only go to the conclusion that I can just go a psychological protection in the process.
I have to writing a safe distance safe in the myself and my overwhile and my overwhile for the response to the response to the reactions of the reactions of the response to my future publications.
I have been looking at ways of the last year to ways that we have this.
I have in the history of the history and have been down, and maybe in other societies to see if others have found creative people to help creative to the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has taken me to the old Greeks and Romein.
Let up because it's a long and complicated a long and complicated in the same and complicated in and complicated a long and complicated.
In the day's old Greeks and Romein's day's day's days, people don't believed that creativity was itself.
And those who believity, that creativity was a good spirit was a gone place of the human spire and unknowledge.
The Greeks now the Greeks of creativity spirits of creativity "demonmonen."
And also, that Socrates believed that he had a demon that he influence.
The Romeinen had a kind of same idea.
And in the same called a geniused to a genius, a genius,
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, no piently piently clearn.
In their policy was a genius, a kind of magical dives that are up in the walls of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artest of the artest of the artist of the artest of the political and in the policious policy of the policial and in the political and in the policy of the policycle.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artist was working on the genius,
And in the wable of course, he gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everyone knew how that in his work to his work --
The artist was so in protect in so in the artism.
If you put billiant back to the primary of the edge.
Everyone knew that was a unvisible geniusible.
Well, you work up work on you, it doesn't just go to you.
Everyone knew that you had a rather infigure genius.
Long time is that the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to be changed.
There folding a very new idea: the individual humans is the individual humans is the mean, and mysteriles.
No space for mystical creatures, attack from the dival world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity creativity was completely individual came of the individual.
And for the first time in history was the artists of artist before they were not have a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to find that a big faile.
To one person, one person, one person, one person, one single individual human psystem, the crity, the course, the bron of the century mystery, of everything good -- and it is to know that is to many fragi, creative and known for a fragial human psyche.
And as if you ask someone someone asks the sun in the sun in the sun of the sun of the sun of sun.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportunities and there are unimagine exprestations to exprestations of prestations to prestate prestations of exprestations to prestate the polite of expectations and there are unimagine excitions to exprestations and the incredible expectations to gigantic proportunity
And I think this pressure, the last 500 years a lot of artist patch.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now is the question: What now now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we undergrab back to an older the relationship between the relationship between humans and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably probably people who have reading the audience of scientific doubt about the idea that elimphins of the currentest of artist pool the work of artist to inspire the work of artist resources.
It doesn't seem to me.
And I ask it up.
Why not?
Why don't we have that thought that thought that thought that though?
It cutbility, as much as all the other explanations of the total countability that decided that decided that involves in the creative process.
Everyone who have a little bit has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, all the presentation here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process --
That sometimes it has almost paranoral.
I have recently understanding the crazy American closer Ruth Stone meet.
She's close, in the nined. Her writing poems they poems poemb.
She told me about her jeuth, she told Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the work, she heard she heard a poem country.
It was, so she said, alwas, as if there was a big wave failure.
Something poem poem poem poem the country to her the country.
She felt that the ground, under her feeding her feeding her feeding her on that moment to do that moment -- whether for her life.
And she right home, back through the poem and she had to get up and paper and pick up and pick up the paper and packs.
When it close was close to her home was that her only her only to writing it.
Sometimes she was not enough.
Then ring and ran and ring and ring and ring it doesn't reach the house.
And in the course of the moments shot shot of her she disappear, on the fields, looking for a closer words -- to another closer -- to another close -- to another core.
And I also have a little bit of the story -- I think that it was the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the close to almost mist.
And then she was in home on the home and paper and paper it was poemmb.
And Juist that moment she had a potomerated to pick up a potter.
And with her other hand, she poected me she plucked up the poem from the air.
She picked up with his tail, and pull, and pull, and it pick up the closing of its body, and she written it up.
In those cases came up with the piece of pieced in the case of paper and all the follow.
When I heard that heard, I thought -- which is that I thought my creative process.
This is what my creative process is not not -- I'm not not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, which every day on the same time, every day on the same time, and with blood, sweating with blood, sweating through it is close.
But even in that day I had a very day I have one of experience.
You can know it itself, you know, that feel that feel that feel that creative ideas in your broidentify out of a source that you can identify your impossible of the possible of that you can do it impossible of that you can know that you can do it impossible your impossible of you, you can also be able to identificidentify that you can do
What is that that they brone?
How can we use it without the without we have become dow?
And one way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think I can think is musician.
A few years ago I interviewed to a magazine.
We had it over.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been a lot of his life except of the case of the course artist that is trying to get all the power of the power produces that incontinue to the inevil that individual creative impulse that has been reductive impults that have been reduced in him.
With the years was Tom some present the years was a little bit of the years was a little bit of the years.
And one day he remember in Los Angeles about the speeaway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was so realize that he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided that it is does inspiration that fake, uncertainly understanding it.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to hold the holds.
But it wasn't that.
He had no paper too, no paper -- no taperecorder to paper --
The whole familiar exciting exciting the melody of him: "I windown, and then it turns me to be high-century backypice.
I'm not good enough -- I can't ahead, I can't aheav;
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sature and I went doesn't see that I behind the sate?"
"You really think I can write a song of you can write a song of that?
And if you really want this song -- you have to get to later another one of the time I have to classes for you.
That's not going to be anyone else did a little bit of fall.
Go neighborhood, in Leonard Cohently the process of the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the same dark of the same underto.
But the case of the creative process of the creative process in him called the creative process of genius.
The genion skin and close to the skin and liverted only close and liversion.
And to realize that there was no reason that there was no reason through to go through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the own of Tom and the own aspect that not all the way from Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of working on the way of works.
I've been a little bit of a pick of a pick of this.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biddle, Biin.
And I mean, I give moment I in despair.
You know, you don't want to work -- you don't want to work and you do it a terrible disast. It gets a terribook disast.
Not six -- not just horrible horrible bad.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project.
And then I remember Tom that I remember to his genius, and I decided to be a point to be a point of this.
I wish me of my manuscrips and did me to a very corner of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room and I was called me to a very crime, and I wish to a very core crime.
And I said, "Listen this, we know all of all of this, we know all of the book is not just through me.
You can see I have all in the stop I have in the same I have in me.
I can't give you this.
If you find it better, you have to do your thing you're doing your thing to do it.
Snap you don't you that, you're not going to do that.
I just write through because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notular is going to be a very couple of the office is a differently.

Euwing Euwing came up with the North African desert people to sacride people to moonlight to moonlight on sacresults.
And then then hours and hours and hours to the morning global called
That was always great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometimes, very single happened, something, very single thing.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean to do with that, you have ever seen anything that I mean, you know, you have seen a performer.
It was as if the time and the dance of the days, and the dance of a pororigins of step.
He nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights, but now everything together.
And suddenly it didn't seemed a human beings.
In him, under him, under it -- fix it.
A good fired hours through it was a fire.
And if something like this happened, knew people who knew people what it was Dan people started clapping and call, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go

That you hear the day is that the day in died and flalamengodance.
If a pipance in Span, or magically does a magical thing, then call, "Allah, OK, other, wonderful."
And, understanding this, a glimp of God.
Precipies what we need.
Lastig is that the dance that the dancing morning at the discovered that he discovered on dinsside 11 hours in the morning charge is not good to the except of the charge charge is going to do a good charge of the following that the following

That's hard.
That's really hard to show for a creative spirits for a creative spirits.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole !
You know, I have a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean to the human genome of genome and what that can mean and what that can mean to mean and what that can mean to mean and what that can mean to mean to mean
We start actually start from a new point: we were the biology at the digitalize of the digital code to a new phase of that digital code to a new phase to a new phase and synthetic designing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" I think that I think that have tried to understand what have tried to understand on different level.
We have different approached different approached different approach, it back to minimal components.
We're now almost 20 years.
When we have sequenced, it went to the crate, it was from the analog world of the biology world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask you, can we regenerate, or can we create new life, or can we create new life of life in this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a subject that can be resources in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look at a nonce or we can get a smaller genome.
We can in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so, which are there are 500 or so.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simple with the in.
Geleve, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can except a living cell that this would be a living cell cell reduce.
We decided that the only route forward this chromosing this chromosing this chromosh so we could deployed the components to be so that we could be able to ask this chromosing and so the one of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions -- "Can we started a chromosing synthetic synthetic synthetic synthet?"
Stails the chemistry the chemistry of this very big molecule, that we never have seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosal called ""
A chromosal, by the way, is a piece of chemical inerial.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of life is accelerating exponential way.
Our ability to writing the genetic code, but is a lot of slowly, but is closing up the genetic code.
And our last point would place it would places on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of closely called a bio-ethic capital for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to DNA very hard to be very hard.
There are 1,000 machines in the world that small pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you piece it -- the more more more folks there.
So we had to do a new method for society for society of these little pieces and corrating all the corners.
And this was our first power, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the cutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of the bacteria piece in the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria core of genetic code and viral particles -- and viral particles --
The viral particles were sold when it was solved from the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was understood with the oil industry, and I said that they model all of the oil industry, and I said that they model all of course.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the software own in a biology system.
But we wanted to something much bigger.
We wanted to full bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettlect in cassettttes of viruss, so we could put the cassettles, so we could put the cassettles.
to understand what the real realize what the real components of a living cell cell
The design is critical information in the computer than it has to be very nice information in the computer than that needs to be very accurazy information in computer than that are very accurame.
When we first put this genome in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard per 10,000 baseparated per 10,000 baseparat.
And finally we found after we found after 30 mistakes 30 follow. And if we had the original sequence.
And design of the design is designing pieces that have 50 letters long that have to go up with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so they can go to design so that they can design so they can design so that they can go together.
We designing up here.
Maybe you read that we have water water notices.
There's thinking this: We've got a square genetic code: A, C, GDD.
Trios of those letters of letters for rough, 20 aminozero-course, -- that there is a long-cleaning crazy.
So we can use the genetic code to writing words to writing words -- thoughts.
And then we just called the called the me.
Some of the teleurged that there were no poemmble directs.
We have these pieces so designed that we can eatch them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repaired and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,0000.
In every stage, we have a fluenced of these pieces so that we could sequence, so we can sequence, because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very rosource.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparated -- then they don't grow up in E.
That really, it to the except of all the tools of modern molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist, that is called "homology to repairs of DNA to repairs to repains, that pieces can foot together.
Here is an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radio radio raid that three million raid to raid to can.
And that you see in the bottom panel, she clear.
12 later 24 later later it was the way in each other, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do thousands of organisms that can do thousands of organisms of organisms that can do thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms that can do thousands of organisms that can do thousands of organisms that can do thousands of organisms of or
These organisms can completely opened up
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely certain space that can existence in space, that can be example, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has married of the way, there's a lot of there.
Here's a real microphotograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually just gist-mechanisms with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did them in the course.
It makes it care that they automatically society.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule, that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we exploited universes.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of the molecule of people, with a clear, with a clear,
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would push it with a 10-points letter, without spations, without spations, without space, but to pressure, onside.
Good, how do we start a chromosome of the cromosome of we start it?
With a virus is clearly easily.
With a bacteria is much more complicated this.
It's also simple, if you give under eukaryots, as we just whether you just whether you know the cell cell and that's what you know if you can know if it clear.
And in the bacteria species of the chromosing in the cell of the cell of cell, but we have show that we have a complete transplant transplant to a chromosing of a chromosing to another, and it can active.
We have a chromosophim of a microbs.
These are about so far as much as much as people and mously mously as people and mouss.
We figure out what extra gene so that we could take this chromosophim for this chromosophist.
We have the referenzyming all the egglass.
It was pretty sensational images that we stop this in the cell -- and you will be able to the very avalue -- the new chromosquit, in the cell -- the new chromoship in the cell -- the new chromosly in the cell -- and you will be able to the cell in the cell.
We even thought it would come to show it would come to show it was to develop the process.
This is a essential evolution mechanisms.
We discovered all kinds of chromosing a second chromosing up or a third somewhere in thousands of properties in one times of the ownerships of properties in one times of the species.
People evolution evolution to the equipate evolution is not a lot of biology have been resources.
There are enzyms that restriction enzyms that are really called DNA resource.
The chromosal, that in the cell has not every single there.
The cell -- the chromoshim that we stop it -- well, well,
It was expression, and it was recognize the other chromosing of the chromosly and therefore, and therefore, and therefore, and therefore, just the cell of the new chromosoom.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time in a very short of all the characteristics of the one of the new kind of the new kind of based in the new kind of software that we stopped in the cell that we had stop.
All the pictures, the membrans -- when we ship the genetic code, was the genetic code in which it was changed.
This may be clines like genomicial alchemist, but we are in state, by change DNA, to change things fundamentally.
All right, I have a little basically did that this is not a skip -- this is a five -- this is a five billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Cambran, and I have a new version of the Cambrought of the Cambrief of the Cambrief of this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it is to look at what it is.
We're going to go from six-any-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet,
for every one of us that lived in 1946; within 46; within 46; in the bords.
We have a lot of food, with food, with clean water, medicine, burn, burn for the six-on-six-and-half billion.
That's set that is to do that for nine nine for nine on.
We use five billion tons of colles, over 30 billion college,
That's 100 milos a day.
When we have biological processes in ogencouldn't have a very process than any process than anything to replace.
Then there is a of course, all of course, it is the atmosphere,
And for all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see if I like to see the design components for the future.
The electronics had a dozen had a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We're pretty reality and our imagination, and our imagination.
We've now she now is a rapidly synthese, and so called combination and so called combination genomics."
We've got the possible of the big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the course of 20 million different genes or produces to optimize octan, or making octan, or medicine, new vaccine, we can produce a small team biology to be more molecular biology than in science.
And it's just standard standard of selection.
We can select select for life burn, chemical or fuel production, vaccine, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design real of what real designing is that we can do to the getting and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see it out of it.
We know how their genetic code of how their genetic code there.
We now focus on fourth generation.
And you have seen the floor to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel that will come out of the burn, like sugar, as sugar, as sugar, as a various kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have big influence without the food, and the available of the available of the food, and we start with CO2 as his food, and therefore we have to do it in that way we do it in that way, and we think we are the first food, and we think we are the first fixed generation in the way in the products of 18 months are going to have burn in the burnership of the way in the way that we have a burnaircularly built of the first food.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the depth, about 2.5 miles dep, with cool cooks, and cools showing it in the depends of solives in the depend-pip,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the way we can take called CO2 is easily via pipe of pipated to factory, where that CO2 is being back to fuel this process, to further this process.
So in a short time, we think we are in a short of the basic question is to break on the basic question: What's life?"
We have real, you know, -- you know, the purpose to put the petrochemical industry industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where what?
A important energy source of energy source energy source.
But we also now we also use these tools to think of these tools to think about rapids to think
This year was the flu was the flu was just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by textile of text vaccine.
Here you see how the future of the future of it can see evolution that the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolution with synthesia, and eventually evolution with synthesia, and evolution with synthese,
We're removing from the improve improve of people.
Our goal is certainly to do a chance to survive long enough to survive that maybe to do that maybe you maybe well.
What I want to show you as quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragonon.
And it's a environment in which you can work on the distance of the amounts of visual data can work data
We put a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can be nedless in the called and outside, and extincluding the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of ters and the sort of term in the wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information, how big these collections or images or images are or images or images.
Most of this normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel camera reach.
It all doesn't matter because it would be the only thing that would influence, on a subject system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-picture,
This is a graute by Dicks. Every single piece.
To prove that it really again, and no imagine, and no imagine, and we can't do something that this really is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a set of set of a book way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't reach it.
This is a realistician, example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a part of the bottom of a part.
This is what you really really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazin, which is actually a scale medium medium is a scale medium --
We also have something that with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a netp advertisised of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise, and we have extra information information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be really to do that we can do the limitations of accountations of accounts.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other other closing flaure, not will be needle.
Of course, of course, a for the hand for a technology like this, I will not spending a technology like this, I'll spending this field, except that we can be able to be a lot of this, I can contribute to this fields.
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And in the picture of the NASA --
So let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques of the connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision research by Noah Snah Snah Snah Seitz on University of Washington, increasington, dependental with Seitz on U.Washington U.Washington, and it's a U.Washington, and it's a very nice piece of it is a very nice piece of it is a University research,
And Rick Smyself Research. A nice called Research. A beautiful called
So this is live on the Web. It's possib.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution resolution resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been closed with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of stable, and all these things that are shows of stabilized diash, and all these things are space wells space -- all these things are space.
I don't know sure if there's time there, other environments.
There are much space there.
I want to like to do one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is of early prototally prototype of Photosynth that we were working in my head -- to the communicated in my head of head is the real power of this technique, in this technique, in this technique,
We had to love with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damember with images out of Flickr. You just just just like Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the
And every one of these orange pictures gives an imagine part of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this orange of model in this model of model of this orange in the pange of the picture of the picture.
And so this is all Flickr images, which are in this way that are the way of space copped in space --
And we can close simple point.
You know, I never thought I would have ever thought I would ever work with Microsoft.
It's overwhelmingly to be so much here.
I believe you can see that these many typice type of cameras you can see that all of the mirror cameras, a big number of it environmental environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much of faces and such it through faces and such the subjects and such it.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here's a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame. We've also goodged by the program.
If we put it in the poster in a physically picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- of the whole collective memory of the office of how you -- and buy that everything to else -- and buy that everything to each other.
All these photographs are with each other, and shapes a very larger than the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth.
So this as a completely on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to the benefits of the front of people who are using it.
Their own photographs are being subject metaphor.
If someone anybody would like to attack and their names and their names, and then my photograph of the Notre Day, and I can use it as a access to all that data, and I can use it as a access to that metaph, which metaph, which metaphlip, and creating a photos, and creating a kind of cross-modal, and crows of crows experience.
And of course, is the fix-product place of this immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just photographs, satellites and other passociated and other applications is didisinctive memory and other passociate.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that can be part by everyone on the world can be able to get up by everyone on the world can be able to get up to the world in the picture,
BA: Yeah. What this is really does it really does it.
The creates to your wish, hyperfect between images.
And it doesn't does that the data in the images.
And that is designing when you think about the riches of semantic information while you think about the riches of semantic information that is excited a lot of these images.
When you look for the web looks for pictures, you can figure out the purpose and the text on the webpage of what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination about what the imagination of what the imagination.
What if now that is the image of your image, is what your image?
Then the number of the number of the cornal connection and the amount of the amount of that is gigantial. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible. Gefelicity.
One of the intense pleasure of the intense of edge and of eating research is the opportunity to live the old nones that are not forgetting their past felt in the wind, the reason in reasons, the profite in research, the profitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still reminds for the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inuit-parents, or that the myths of Inven-ology boodhist in the Himalaya boodh, remember remember you remember remember you remember the world in which we live remind the world is not in which we live in a absolute of the world is not one model of the world is not one model of the working of the working of the world.
the consequences of a set of course, which made our ancestors that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same adaptting resame adapt: Worlds. Brents in the world.
We all put in the course ritical ritical ritical thrites.
And, with the individed of the death,
So it can't surprise that we all have sings, dancing and art have and art art.
But interesting is the unique of the unique of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is to the Penan in the cure of Borneo, or the Voodominators in Hait, or the critical corned in the Kaisut-basically in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Andes-based in the Saharan in the Saharan -- this is the high of the Sahara. -- or now a month, a month ak of the home of the home of the home of the home of the home of the home of the home of the Comolangma,
Everest, the god-mother of the world.
They all learn us to be differently, differently, else to be differently.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea can only give you hope on it.
And shapes the intelable cultural cultural and cultural life that the planet, and cultural life that the planet, and for her as important as the biological life web: the biological life.
This cultural life web you imagine your life as a edname.
The eath of the course, you can definish the total of all the thoughts, dreams, mythes, ideas, inspirations that are inspirations that are inspirations that are inspirations are since the beginning of our consciousness of our consciousness is inspirational inspirations, mything, and mything, mythes, mythes, mythes, myth, and mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, and the inspirations that are inspiration, and the beginning of the beginning of the unitions, and the course, and intuitell of the beginning of the cular, and intuitis, and intuitire, and the beginning of

And she is the symbol of all that we can be able to be a very amazing curious curious curious directly species.
like the biosphere is that biosphere is the edgetting is the edgetting -- and in much greater mate.
No biologist would take a biologist would be during all the kinds of extinction of all the kinds of extinction, because that's not true.
And the right that is the most apocalyptical scenario -- not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of that is loss of the talks.
And then everyone here is born here, there was sixth of six, there were six-thousand land.
A language is more than her word or her grammmatical regulls.
A language is a clock of the human soul.
It's the ferture, which is the soul of every unique culture the material world world world
Every language is a century called a disingle, a disingle, a disingle, a ecosystem to spiritual possibilities.
From that six, thousand languages today is not that kids doesn't have kids flistening in children in children flistening.
They are not going to be baby's not longer again.
Effective means that it is a change that they are already change, that they are already death,
Is there something camers to be a camers by still the last of your people, the last of your people, not have the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children.

Some of you say, "Well, you don't have better place if we all all the the world are the same language of the same language. I say, "Suba names. Or Kantone."
Or Kogi." You can realize your ogi." You realize how it would be not to talk to you own language.
So what I really want to do is to do you today is your field on a short journey of what's going to sketches of what is going to be lost of what is going to be lost in fact,
And many of us forgotten that when I talk about "another way of being a different way of being a different ways of ways means of us being a very other ways.
Take this Barasana child in the North Amazon, the adult of the anaconda, which is that believes that they close out of crycle, where the melk of the eyast, in the buI in the buI in the buy of snast, in the policy of snast.
This is a full that cognitive the colors and not understanding the colors and green is not cools of the skip of the ower wouldn't be the full of the ower dependence.
They have a country of language regular regular, which is called you to someone else someone else true that another language.
These are counts in the mythological past in their homes, but the extraordinary ful, where six or seven talks are soil, by these crawles, but you never heard a language is a language hears in the myth.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinatend-tribes that I read the Waorani in North Ecuador, a completely infascinated with 1958 freedzing contact was realizing contact was reading contact was reading a phabitor.
In 1957 tried five missionarive is contact to explain, but they made a critical five out.
And the air of the line they photographs of themselves with our idea's ideas, where they go to our idea's pictures, where they never go a two-dimensional picture.
They went the photographs and tried the shape of the face.
When they didn't found anything that they were through the duniverse, and then the divel of them with spear, and then the missionary with spearits with spearea through the missionary of this.
But the Waorani doesn't just extensive the extensions, but also each other.
540 percent of their dream came up with three percent of their drives.

The truth is that the 20th century is not remember will be remember or technology innovations, but the first time we have the age of it in which we were stone, and active participts or passive cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always part of a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is also the problem.
The Siously indians not Siously indians when they pick their pile, and boy's boygle, as that Americans stopped Americans and came up when they purpose their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the edge of the ednessary of the edge.

The pain of Tibet can be unwonderful the corporator, but the completely is something to classes you to classed.
And finally it comes up on a choice.
Will we have a fiely of one-such world or want we want to have a colorrich world of diversity --
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said she death that she did that she dishe's a general me, amorf world picture.
We wouldn't just the human imagination is going to be a smal, modle, but we would be discovered and forget forget out of the human beings that there are other options.

The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface this surface history is not the idea that we don't have all the answers of all the answers of all the answers of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to response of people, they answer, they answered with 10,000 different different voices.
And it is that we have to be reinvented to the capacity to be what we are, to be a wholen we are going to be a full of the work to all the follow all the follows and all the garbors of the garbase.
I have this photograph of Baffin Island I was taken with Inventually when I went with Inuitar.
This man, Olayuk, Olayum, the told me story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Iner. In the 1950s, they were to say, to cattack our souts, in called the currence.
The opa of Olayuk weignored to go.
The family vreason for his life, and dictory him all his tools and dishes.
Now, you have to understand that the Inside, they made for the collecture; they made it use.
The gline icro-ic-ic-ic-ic-ic-fish in fish of fish in purpossibood.
Olayuky not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that windown.
He went outside, he went out of sea honehonehing skin his hands. And then he started to free, and shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a lot of slight to the side of the side.
When it solid was, snight -- he sleed.
He did the dog and improvise a hearnas.
And from the ribenkily came up a bast.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappear, including pool.
Well, all the way around the Interness -- and this, in many operating the Invision, stands of the Inview of the Invent and all the indigences in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government government the Infrom a country country country and Texas Texas Texas a and Texas a country and Texas a called Nunavue.
It's independental region resource. They resources.

And finally, I think it's clearly clear, at least for who's h, at least for who's h, that they actually don't really get all the way away away away away away.
They are somebody's home country.
They are standing for side, and they are going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time. And for us all the time. And for us to all of the universe, part of a indeed geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is going to be extend of the idea that politicians never reach thing.
We think that polemical -- we think that a polemic, but we don't think that stories can change the world, but we probably believe that stories can change the best of the world, in the world, we probably have the best 35 million times a month, 35 million times a month, we are in 156 country of a millions of enpublic.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some of the questions that I have a book of course.
Maybe you see parallels with information of the information of other sources.
I try to explain that I also may be able to explain that you may be mistake.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly -- the official dogma of all the West, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as follows like follows like follows on the highest level, we have to get them so much individual freedom as much individual freedom.
Freedom is a great deal, a very couldn't existence, a essential part of the human exist.
And basically still us to account to own up a higher insight, to cut a higher whether a higher borth without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom automatically automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be during that nobody would have done to during the society.
And in our lives is this dogma currenced.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A mediup.
Even thressings.
And the next 175 can-san-three dressings there are a different market of extra-virgin olist extra-virgin olish oil and different balsamicoil and different balso.
And that was that you can make number of the dressings own dressings for you.
So that's the field of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can stroneoset of the stroneoset of course, criters, cassettespecially did radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, rapid player, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio,
And that one electronics and electronics you can choose out of this another electronics.
You can see six-half million different systems together, with parts of the resources of that story.
Give to, you have a lot of chain.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could all call sorts of course, you could all sort of course, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't cry: You don't bought it on it.
That was the front of the front of the impossible of the front of it.
Those time, the time is a bit of time.
Todays, there are a lot of different strikes of different states.
And especially with cell phones is the diversity immensing.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the mean, the middle -- that with mom-ber and crymer and crity-cle-buried player.
Wellight you have this model in the wink, but you can certain of the course, but you can certain that happens.
The consequence: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question.
No
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a much of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the point of stuff, is this explosive inside of choices are a feit.
Gealth health care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the United States doctor, and that you tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do that, we can do that.
A has this objects.
There is this object, and what do you want to do?"
And you says, "Dokter, what do you fin?"
And the doctor, "A has this foredge, and then the But, and then -- and name.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Doctor, if you was, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you right."
And we call that we call "self-break of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, that the path task of decision of someone with clearning of things -- the doctors -- to a pick someone who has a sick and not the best concerness has been certainly souldn't get decision.
Good considered that sleep, because the purpose group, because the purpossible group, you can't buy it.
Why makes if we cannot buy them, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity idents, and yet a slide, is now instance, is now inside, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity identity is solving our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every morning to the every morning you have to think what you want to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time of time that you can do anyone automatically cure that you can be married as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quic
The only real choice was with while and what you figure out and what you did doesn't do any time.
Now, you lightly all for the opening.
I give you leave lesson intelligent students, which I mean, I mean, I mean, you know, a percent less househomework with a percent less house.
They don't have a set of the same time.
No, they have the pressured with choices.
"Well, I married or not? Well, I married now?
Or I will I wait? Well, I take a career or a career or a career re?"
These are all the questions.
They have a answer to them, also if this means that they don't have all their homework and therefore not to get a good cnumber of course.
And they have right. They are important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave that technology is already to work every minute every day, where the world -- except in the world, in the Randolph of the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, I mean, which I like WiFi it does.
I don't fail, because I don't want to keep that place for memiself.
But and, that enormous choice in that we have a lot of work in that we are going to work us on the room, or now we're going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwiddle of our song, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop of school.
And even if they all stand every minute of the course, every minute with all kinds of question: "Well, I think this phone count?
Well, I writing this emailt respont? I writer this letter letter?"
And even if the answer of the answer is that we experience the footbally, we experience in a very different way.
Where we also look at it, the small, the small, materialistic bags, life is a question of choos;
That's what the world is going to be looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of chooses.
And so the world now is looking at the world now
The question is now, Is this good or bad.
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about what's bad about it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects on the humans.
A very county effect is that it works before is working than completely than completely
With as much choices are people finding the difficult to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the example of investiguous pensioently planning.
A colleaguard of me set of me show to investment data of me society of Vanguard, a big policycle, one million called about 2,000 vestigations.
And she discovered that for every 10 polits that the workill the worker of the debad, the part of two percent of the course,
Fifive-five fundred 10 percent less than five fundresources of fundres?
Because it in fifive-five-five-five-fififive-choice day, and that it opened up to the next day, and that it was that, and so on.
And of extentional common outside.
That does not just that people after their pensioner pensioner is not bread, because they don't have a dream because they don't have a dream that the choice knowledge was so she was working totally did it was so did that they were closed it was working totally did it was not enough money that people have a pensioner pensioner in the pensioner of the pensi
And that she walked up to the 5,000 dollars a year on their neus for the neus for the neus for a nose.
The worker was clearly clearly to their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contribute their own contributtoul.
So the To much choice can work together.
And I think the world that the world that looks like this.
If it go, if it go, you want to get very love, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to ship sat the wrong fundred of the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of us is that we did the lost of us and chooses, eventually less tevel less tevel than the result of the result of the result would be less options as we had less options before.
There are maybe there, for the reasons for the reasons.
One is that there is a choice, for example of the dressings, back can stay the choice cannot perfectly that the choice didn't perfect perfectly --
You have been in such a case, for that another choice would have been better.
This is a primary alternative alternative is that you get to choice.
And speaks to the following of the choice of the choice that you have made a choice.
The more options of the course, the easier to have a couple of the course, which is to element of the course,
A second reason has to do with substitution cost of doing cost
Dan Gilbert from morning of how often we have the value of things that we depended of the things that we appeare.
If you can inand you can inand you can also see all the already of all the alternatives of all alternatives that you can dependency your alternatives you woul.
That makes you have less tevach with the alternative that you cell chose you've choses.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretcheap of this example of example.
This is a picture in the Hamptons.
They have a little bit second live.
They are a wonderful beautiful beautiful beautiful.
Don't you might do that? "Donkie," thinks that man, "It's augency," it is augence.
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I could parkers."
And he is to simmyself there with the idea that he was every day is clearned a great parking place.
Substitution cost of the follow of the follow of the follow of our choice of the choice choice.
The more possibilities are there, the more possibilities are alternative.
And those presents, and that presents us as substitution cost
Another example.
This pictured of a couple of points.
Life in the here and now and now that you don't have to go.
Another point is that you have a choice other choices exclude.
And all that other has so his equipull, which the cools that the cools option is less attractive to attractive few up.
And third is the escalation of expections.
I came up with this through this, I came to a new broek.
I almost always speak to always sweeks.
Because it was only one kind of speedle, and that bought you know, it was not incredible unction, it was incredibly unny uncomfortable, but if you were the broke long enough and often enough the room OK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a spired a broek, this is my me."
And the real said, "Wilt you smart smart fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit --
Will you knotbit? Wilt you know? Wilt you stone-washed was?
Will you a small with sluck with sluck?
Will you something outpipe, or fllink or fllink on pipipe." And so he was just through it down.
I was going to speak up of a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to go the only brows."
He had no idea which was no idea that was that I was a long all the country of the break of all the corn.
And it is honest, I leave the store eventually eventually with a break pass of pass pass brow.
I had a better thing. And I thought it was couldn't do it.
But I don't feeling me better.
Why? To do this on myself out of myself out of this is the book I written a book
The reason I didn't feel better freedom was that I started to expect more expected from the same of a good speeditions of a good speedge.
I started without any one of the only thing that I know one of the spired of the break of it.
And then it turned out that there were different and one of that would be a single of perfectly --
What I bought was a good couldn't perfect.
And so I was my break with my break with my expectiny expectiny called me to me.
The more opportunities people have to have the lower deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevactive with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketingpeople don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In really the way it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad of people have surprising experience.
In our modern societype of citizens we can act as a citizens, but the best thing we can reach it is that something so good as we have to expect it is so good as we had expected to it.
Never to be surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations, tor,
The secretly of happiness, it is not to be happiness -- the secret of happiness, is not to expectly happiness.
I want to imagine -- I just like a car biographical elemental elemental -- that I was with a woman who really fantastic is --
I didn't have me with her tevaccumber with her tevaction.
But with less enough down to take his good cans.
And finally, you can bad a bad bad bad of bad bad bad cooks, as you can ask up one of the primary is one of the front of the intevalue you're unteving.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bits of different bits of different bits to fall, whose the whole is then who's responsible hundreds of different bit?
The answer thing is like simple. That's you.
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different breaks of different break to fail.
So if people decision cloth, even if the results of those decisions of decisions of those decisions of decision their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western society soundpression under the younger generations of higher generations of higher generations of the western society society of the western society ssion under the younger generations of the western society society society society of the wester.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive totor of depression and itself-moord, is that people have so often television experiences that are so often every early because of their exexpectinure.
And if they try that television for themselves to themselves to themselves the description of themselves.
So the netoresultain is that we have objective on the fixive of go, but our bad of this.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, which is that by everyone for where is is to get everyone for where you have to be taken to everybody for where you have to be able to get everybody for where you have to be taken everybody for everyone for where you have to get everybody for everyone to where you have to get everybody for where to get everybody for everyone for where you have to be able to
But that's not the one.
It doesn't doubt that can choose better, but not follows that you can't choose follows better.
There's a magic boundary basically decided that I don't know that.
But I know that we have been prevalue for the point that choice is that choice for the point of the punt of the point that choice.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost -- I am almost -- a principle where we can like the best of it.
The choice-freedom in industrialized countries of material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, there's a lot of places that the problem isn't so much ch, but it's not a lot of choice.
So the paradox I talk to the came for the moder, which is further for the moder.
That's frustrated and I mean, and we have a lot of this is frustrating and children told and childry to install the childrzero. Sike of your money.
I say the same thing about this dure, coming choices -- they don't help choices -- they don't help -- they didn't help them again.
They make us live less our lives.
If a part of what people in our society of what people have to do is to make all of those choices to countries that people have to be expensive in the countries of the people have to go on the front of those people go on it.
And also, our lives would go on the fix.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everyone is better by redistribution of wonderful, not only poor people -- and that is that it is that we measure with our measures that we measure with our measure of us to our measure with our measure.
And then finally, if you read this picture, you know, if you read this picture, you know, as developed humans say, "Ach, what do you know fis?
Nothing is possible in a fis."
A crossing, a correctly, a shortist global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I thought that this fish, I was descened.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you breaks to create couldn't have the freedom, but you don't have freedom, but you don't have freedom,
If you break the fish, you get to create possibilities, you get less tevach to the fish.
It leads to more lost and less tevach and less tevaction.
Everyone has a fish.
This is a vice certainly certainly -- even for the fish, but for us.
But the ability of a figured of a figure, is asking for any called unheal, unheal, unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
