A few years ago, Peter Skillman here, at TED, at TED, a design.
The marshmallow-challenge.
The idea is pretty simple: Groeps need to make a four high-possible piece of spaghetti, a meter, a meter, a meter tape, a meter, and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow to the top.
And, although the simple sound, it turns out, it turns out to work together, because this concerned to work together.
And because I found this is an interesting idea, I decided to get it in a design workshop.
And it was a big success.
Since then I've done this exercise in about 70 design workshops around the world with students, designers and architects, designers and architects, and architects,
And this exercise gives us deep insights us how people working together, and I want to share with you.
And normally, the first step that people are prepared on the cause.
They talk about, they talk about how it is going to look like, playing power.
And then they're going to organize.
They sketch and spaghettile.
The biggest part of the time they built bigger building large,
And at the end, when the time is almost of time to pick up the marshmallow them to the marshmallow them back to the top, doing a piece of course. Tay!
They amazing their work.
But what really happens, usuallows is that the touch changes in a "oh oh," because the weight of the marshmallow the weight of the marshmallow the whole building.
Beping people have more of those "oh oh" moments than oh oh."
What of the worst of the worst is a MBA.
They lose play, they fall, and they'd fall, and they're making down.
And of course, there are of course, there's a lot more "touch-built working.
And at the best under they've been studied in the best under them.
That's pressive.
And Peter tells us, that they're not just the highest building the most interesting.
So what you're doing now is, how can do this: How can do this: How do you do that?
Peters answer is: "None of the children says, "No Spaghetti BV."
They don't spend a time with power power.
But there is another reason.
And that is that economists are trained to find the only solution.
And then they're going to do.
But what happens, what's happening, when they explain the marshmallow on the top, is they don't have time. And then,
It's a disaster.
Sounds known?
What does do differently,
is that they're starting with the marshmallow.
They build prototypes, and new prototypes;
the marshmallow to the marshmallow on the top, so they have more opportunities to figure out bad prototypes.
Despecially recognize this shape of collaboration as the basis of a iterative process.
Anybody version is getting the children measure of what works.
So building prototypes is very important.
But let's do how different teams do it.
The average for most people is about 50 cup.
economists have half of that half of the advoces do it something, but not much better.
Cleuters, better than most adults.
Who does it best?
Architects and engineers, happy.
The highest building work that I've been seen foot high.
And why? Because they understand they're understood measures are the key structures are the key to build building stable.
CEOs, is better than average.
But now it's interestingly, if you put a secretary secretary better.
Right? You see the team and you see the team and thinking, "They're going to win."
That you can see. And that's what you can see. And why?
Because they are good at support to support.
They manage the process.
And each team that good regular is and attention to work the prestations of that team is good.
Gespecialized and support skills lead to a success.
If you normal 10 teams are going to do this is going to build around six around the six is building around the six.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, we make it a little bit exciting.
So I walked 10,000 dollars of software from the winning team.
And what do you think these design students do?
What happened?
The next.
No team had building.
One of it, for example, for example, a centimeter, was enough to win price to win.
Interestingly, that a higher case great consequences.
We have repeded repeared with the same students.
And what do you think happen?
So now they're understand the use of prototypes.
And this team changed of the best team in one of the best.
They made the highest building at least time.
So that's a good lesson for us about the nature of rewards and success.
You might ask you may be wondered: Why would somebody want to spend a marshmallow-challenges?
And the reason I work with digital tools and processes to help teams and processes to help the cars, computer games and visual effects.
And the marshmallow-challenge helps them to get behind the cornames to come behind.
What allow every project has its own marshmallows marshmallow?
And the challenge experience, a common experience, a common language, a common the best prototype.
And so that's the value of the experience of this such simple experience.
And for who's interested in marshmallow marshmallows of marshmallow.
On this blog you can see how to build the mashmallows.
There are standing step structions.
There are examples of how people around the world have tricks and adaptations.
There are also world records.
And the fundamental lesson, I think, that design is really a contact sport.
It required the intuits of all of our senses, and that we feel better for the challenge and use for the challenge that for us.
And sometimes is a little prototype of this experience already enough to change oh."
And that makes a big difference.
Thank you very much.
Let's supposed that we have about a machine, a big machine, a big machine, a big machine, and it's a while machine.
And everybody here has to do it.
You can do with it back in the time or in time, but not here and now.
I've been doing what you would choose for the last time this question because I'm the last time this question all of a little friends.
They all want to go back to the time before cars or Twitter or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I am convinced that there is a certainly into nostalgy, to wish.
And I can get there.
But I don't hear there.
I don't want to go back, and not because I am so adventually adventually -- but for the possibilities of this planet.
Now, that are not going to be forward.
So I want to go into the machine and I want to forward in time.
We ever live in the great time on this planet, on this planet on the planet, and also want to be health, mobility of disease.
Never was a time like this.
My grandparents died all around the 60.
My grandparents have already the 70.
And my parents are already at the 80.
So I can hope a piece of piece in the 90.
But it's not just about us.
There's a lot more on the play.
A child today that is born in New Delhi is born a life expectancy in the world 100 years.
Think about that. That's an incredible face.
And why is that true?
The smallpox. The smallpox. The smallpox.
They had an influence on the demography of this world greater than any war.
But they're not away. They're gone.
We have government. Puf!
In the richer world exist diseases, that have a generation of millions of people threat millions of people threat the time.
Difterial, right?
Anybody here knows what?
Intings, modern medicine our possibillions of food for billions of food, are trium of the scientific method.
And for me is the scientific method, the scientific methods, or it works and it doesn't work and shows not, one of the largest results of humanity.
That's the good news.
But let's just never enough that the only news because there are another problems because there are another problems, and a number of other problems, and one of them is that, despite all our billion people hungry hungery to bed in this world, every day.
Their number number of course, and it takes quickly.
And not only that, we also have our imagination of imagination to pollutter.
Drinkable water, agricultural ground, rainforests, oil, gas: they're disappeared, and if we're not able to be able to be able to work from this misery disappear.
So the question is this: Can we do that?
And I think it's clearly clear that we are able to make food for billions without the country without the country without the country without of the country without of the country.
I think we can do this world of energy shapes that can't see him in the design.
I believe that really, no, that's not a wish.
But now comes from the night now that I wake up -- one of the things that I wake up at night.
Never we have been so dependent of scientific advance, never before, and never have been able to make it use.
We are standing on the threshold of the most amazing progress on all kinds of area.
And I really think we have to go back hundred hundreds of the United to be back to the time of the United to find a time that we have the against forward, that we have heart again, that we have heart from today.
People their believes of their believes with such a heart of heart that is impossible to freedom.
And listener, everybody, everybody, everybody has even the right on an own opinion about what advance, but you know where you can't have right?
You don't have right on your own facts. No, you don't have it.
And I've been doing a while about it.
A dozens ago, I wrote a story of years ago, I wrote a story about the New York story.
I was connected to figure out what the most effective measure for the most effective measure for the public health in history.
I didn't know what do is doing, so I wrote a story about it.
I wrote a story later, I wrote a story about genetic food.
On the same thing, but more worse this time.
People were crazy.
So I wrote out there, but a story story, and I couldn't understand why people figure out why people figured, why they thought that the manipulate of molecules on a direction, instead of a result, instead of reflecured to nature.
But, you know, I'm doing what I do. I wrote a story story and went about the order of the day of the day. I'm once journalist; we service, and we service, and that is that.
But these stories stayed me, I could, but I couldn't look at why, but ever eventually well.
And because the fanaticians that fanaticians had no phanaticians.
They were follow up, good substantly,
just like the people in this room.
And it was just that what me ...
But then I thought, you know, let's honestly being honest: We're in this world in this world that we don't have anymore.
We speak two.
We're speak to talk about as between considers.
"Field."
OK, there are reasons and I think that we know them.
We're lost belief in institutions in the science itself in science itself, and there is no reason why not.
You just put a couple of names and the people understand the people understand the people understand it.
Tox, Bhopal, Bhopal, the Challenger, Viox, mass destruction, mass destruction.
I mean, you can say, you can concerned your list.
There are questions and problems with those people that we thought that they were always equired to them.
So again.
Imagine questions, question and evidence and evidence and evidence.
But now comes out, if you get evidence, you've got to take them together.
And the reason I can say that is that we now in a reason now unprecedentific life and which we hope that it will be so flight.
About about 12 years back a horrible story was publishing story, that a connection between the epidemic of the epidemic of autism.
Anyway.
Hopen studies became invented to whether this was true.
And it was a serious; it was a serious.
The data was showed to do.
They were found in the United States, in England, in Sweden, in Sweden, in Canada, and everywhere.
But it doesn't do it, it doesn't does because we believe to anecdots, we believe what we are, and what we think is to see and what we really think we feel and what we really think.
We can't believe him to a lot of paper of a paper of paper of an official governmental institution that data and I can be able to do that.
But you know what?
The consequences were disaster, disastropes and in this fact, and in this fact, the United States are one of the number of the world where the number of the world where the number number of the world where the number of the number of the world.
That is a sand, and we should shoot.
Now, Is terrible this.
What is with using that we could decisions?
Now, I understand it. I understand it.
How many get here?
Does anyone of this audience ever see anybody of making?
Don't often a lot of this.
And there's already not more, but it happened last year 160,000 times in the world.
That's a lot of deathrough course.
But because it doesn't happens here, we can continue, and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy McCarry McCarry Kings and Larry King Larry King Live.
And they can do that because they can't do a distinction between causes and accidental conditions.
They don't understand that these things seem to be the same line, but the practical never really before.
And that's something that we need to learn and we need to learning quickly.
This guy was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
He liberated us from one of our worst self.
No fear, not a death. Polio, poo!" --
That guy there in the middle.
He's called Paul Office.
He developed a vaccine vaccines together with some other people.
It saved the lives of such a 400,000 children in the third world.
Good, right?
What it is good, except that Paul around, except about vaccines and how valuable they are.
and that people should be pretty to hold with it.
And so he says,
So, Paul is a terrorist.
If he's a public speech, then that can only be in community of subjects.
It gets home phone calls because there are people who are price to say that they know where his price to say they know where his children schools.
And why? Because Paul a vaccine.
I don't need to say, but vaccines are indictable.
Take them back, and the diseases will come back back, terrible diseases, and that's what happening.
We've been back.
And it becomes more worse, shortly short again.
And they'll not only myself.
What about polio? Well, why not?
Some student writing me a few weeks back and said she said that she did me a little businessary.
Nobody has ever told me.
She didn't let her child against polio.
In no case.
Good.
Why? Because we don't have. And you know why?
There's not a polio down here.
But, who known, whole, perhaps somebody on a airplane in Lagos, and he's flying to Los Angels, he's now above Ohio.
Within a couple of hours hours a car and comes to Long Beach, where he goes to one of those fantastic TED dinners.
And he doesn't realize that he's a paralyzed disease, and we don't know it because so everything.
That's the planet, which we live.
We're like, rather we love in narrative.
Does everybody's fitamines are clear?
Echinacea, a little bit of antioxid?
I know it because half of the Americans are doing every day.
They're clever, and they use alternative medicines, and it doesn't take how much we discovered that they're valuable.
The data point again.
They're darking. And practically never practically never more than that.
OK if you want to spend 28 billion dollars for dollars for dark.
Donrice. Donker.
Why do we do we do that? Why do we do that? I think I understand hate Big Pharma.
We hate the government. We're writing politics.
That has got to be a healthcustomizations are important.
They are that for millions of our countries.
They're amazing hard to be amazing heart distant under us that they can permitter.
So we walk from away, and where are walking?
We jump in the arms of Big Placebo.
Dage. I love Big Placebo.
But, you know, this is really because the whole of course, and we give billions of billions of dollars.
I brought a few of these things.
Ginkgo, concerned through, acai, I don't even know what that is, I don't even know what that is, but we give a billions of dollars, all of dollars.
And you know what? If I start to call this, and they say, "What can you share the people saying, "What can you share doing.
They feel good."
And you know what? You are wrong.
Because it can't sharing me or the secretary of health service service is that saying, "Hm, I'm not going to give to what my experts about mmographysics."
or the obvious cancer that are patients patients of patients.
If you start with evidence and science and science by believe and magic than you ended up where you didn't want to come out.
Then you get back in the South Africa of Thabo Mbe.
He is responsible for the death of 400,000 of people by concerned that business and citroenoil effectively were effective than the antiviral resource of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of notes in a country that have been placed by this disease.
Don't tell me that these things.
They've always. They've always always.
Now is the most thought epidemic that we find the absurd between the absurd between the absurd between genetic manipulated food and the organic food and the organic elity.
It's an idiot debat. It must stop.
It's about words, metaphors.
It's ideology, no science.
Everything we eat, every shorrely share, each speed, every brush, every brush, every brush, is changed.
I mean, you know, in the "Earth paradiase," there were no mandards.
There's no watermelows.
Even no Christbombs. They all come from us.
We created them in the course of the last 11111,000 years.
Some of those products staying, and others didn't get it.
We did not excited us.
Now we can do the same thing in a more real way.
And, sure, there are risks on connected.
But we can drive vitamine, A can produce millions of healthy can live and longer life.
You don't want to do that?
I don't have to say, that I don't understand that.
We don't want to have a genetic modified.
And why?
Well, this hear you hear the whole time: a lot of chemicals, pesticians, hormonoculture, we don't want to reus to reusef.
We didn't keep companies are taking patents on living things.
We don't want to companies the owner rights own.
And you know what I answer?
You have right. Let's do something about it.
It's true. Our food problem is overwhelming, but that's not science.
It has nothing with science.
This is all about laws, morality, patents.
science is not society.
No country.
Even no idea; it's a process.
It's a process, and sometimes it doesn't work.
But the idea that we need to get the science of science to do her work because we're afraid to do it is really lamong and will be millions of people, and will be millions of people.
You know, in the next 50 years, in the next 50 years, we'll need today.
70 percent.
This graphic imagins the investment of the investment in Africa for the last 30 years.
Schandalig.
They really need it, and we remember it.
And the reason? Genetically, food.
We don't want people to get less food as a cassave as cassave as cassave the cassave --
Cassave is the daily food of a half a billion people; it seems a billion people.
It's just a lot of calories. Because it's a lot of calories.
It does not contains a foods like proteins, and scientists, and scientists, and scientists are doing.
So that people can eath blind.
They wouldn't her anymore, and do you know what?
That would be. It wouldn't have a haute cuisine, but it would be.
And everything I've to say is this: Why are we here?
I mean, let's ask us that once again, why are we that?
Because we don't want to shake with genes?
This is about genes. Here's nothing to make surely continue to chemicals.
Not with our ridiculous passion for hormons, better and more special.
It's not about Rice Krispies, it's about people in life.
and it's about to understand that we start to understand what that wants to say.
Because you know what?
If we don't do it and continue as we are, we are described to something that we don't want to be, high-tech colonialism.
I don't find another way to describe.
It's self, and it's self, and we need to do something about it, and we really have to do something about it.
So after this incredible incredible example, you might want to say, "You might want to say, "You want to say, "You want to say, "You want to travel with these ridiculous?"
Absolutely I want to do.
Now, they're still in the pretty but we have an amazing.
We can use that time machine for everything we want to use.
We can bring them to a future that we want, and we're also going to bring them to where we want.
We've got to continue with these exceptions, and we need to continue, but if we put forward and forward forward, we will have done it.
I know that we can, and that is, and that is, for what me, to me, something that has to know.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A columnist of the Los Angeles.
Steve Lopez, walked on a day,
by the center of Los Angeless,
And when he heard music.
That was a man.
A black man.
Charmant, walk down.
HIIf you played on a fool.
I'm talking now something that many of you --
because the columns of Steve shaped the basic --
for a book that a film.
Robert Downey Jr.
and Jamie Foxx who of Nathaniel Anthony Anthony.
the classically school contrabassist,
that are a lot of promising career had to break --
And through he suffered to paranoil hrenic.
Nathanil stopped with the Juilliard conservatory.
and 30 years later, he swalks ...
by the poorest streets of Los Angeles.
You should read Steve's book or the movie.
Not only for the beautiful bands,
that did between these two men,
But also to see what role to see --
an instrumental roll, if I say that ...
to get Nathanil of the street.
I met Ayers in 2008,
two years ago, in a Disney-concert.
He had happened to an outside of the 10th and 4th symphony of Bethoven.
and came back to back together.
He spoke on a jovial and social way.
about Yo-Yo-Ma and Hillary Clinton.
HIIIs never the Dodgers never the World Series.
All of a difficult violence of a difficult violence
in the last part of the fourth symphony of Bethoven.
We're talking about music. Later I got a mail of Steve.
that Nathanile, that Nathanil like to have a foolles of me.
You have to know that Nathanil doesn't want to be treated.
And when he was treated treated shock therapy.
chlorpromazine and handbook --
and that has drawed it for his life.
The result is he now.
Fall of schizophrenia.
During the worst attacks,
He uplodes --
and disappears long.
He swarves about street ...
and lives with that narignness and the ord in his heads,
That time.
Nathanil was in such an agited state --
And when we started with our first lesson lesson.
He had a manical glowed in she's eyes.
He was disappeared.
He talked about ...
invisible demons and rooks,
and somebody who wanted him to sleep him.
I was scared.
Not for myself, I was scared
that I would be able to reach it --
that he would take away in such a such of such --
and that I would be relationship with the violl --
If I started about shown.
and put down and other exciting exciting example,
of what you have in viologions of violence.
So I began to play.
I played the first part of the violence of Bethoven.
While I played ...
I saw a clear change,
in the eyes of Nathanial.
It was like an invisible medical medicine.
A chemical reaction for my play.
the catalyzator was.
The manic exciting of Nathanials,
and changed in beginning.
In stille curiosity and gration.
If by a wunder package, he showed violence.
and started played to play.
Beping fragments of violence,
that I had to get out. Mended --
Tchaikovsy, Sially.
We started talking about music, from Bach.
to Bethods and Brahms:
Bruckner, all B's.
From Bartor to Esa-Peka Salonen.
I saw in that he's not all ...
a encyclopedical musical knowledge --
but it's personally became personally by that music.
He talked about the same passion,
and the same understanding when I and might my colleagues,
the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Through music and talk about music and talk about music,
This guy changed ...
of the paranoil --
that rights of the stratently,
of Los Angeles,
in a charmante, right?
rilliante, classical schooled music.
Music down. Music changes us.
For Nathanil is music spirity.
Through music can he thought ...
and particularly,
And through his fantasy and creativity,
in reality.
That's how he flight.
There are troubled attacks.
I saw that the essence of art.
That's the reason we make music.
That we take something that in us,
deeply in our nuclear --
Our emotions.
And that we through our artistic lens:
And through our crativity that can provide emotions
The reality of that expression,
all us us.
We're getting up and inspired and inspired.
Nathanile.
and a group friends, a group friends.
The red power of music power to him back --
in a family of musicians.
that understood him --
those are recognizes ...
and that respected him.
I'm always going to stay with Nathanile.
Or it now in Walt Disney Concert Hall ...
or on the street. He reminds me ...
why I become music.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
I want to play something that I'd like to do with cell cell of cell --
Don't give me.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
All 10 years, I am online,
And my goal for the next decade of decade to save the world in the real life to save the world in games.
Now, I've got a plan, and that plan to get more people, you all understood more people, to convince more time to spend more time to spend more time to spend larger and better games.
On this moment we play three billion hours a week online games.
Some of you probably think of you probable, "That is a lot of time to play."
Maybe a lot of time, so much time, so many important problems in the real world that have to solve solution.
But in fact, according to my research at the Institute, which is the opposite where it is.
Three billion hours a week long is not enough to solve in the world's world drings to solve in the world.
More now, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, that we need to increase that number enormous.
And I reach that we need in totally 21 billion hours play per week.
That is probably a strange idea, so I'll say it again.
If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global, global conflict, I believe that we have to try to try to play we've got to try to playing to play agames at the end of the next decades of the next decade of the next decase.
This is the reasonable reasonably photographs are so important to be so important for the future of humanity.
This is a portrait by a photographer, Phil Toledanoledano.
He wish the emotion of the games.
So he put a camera for gamers as they playing.
And this is a classic emotion,
Now, if you're no games, you'll probably you'll probably what nuances in this photograph.
You probably see the feeling of pressure, but also intense concentration, but also intense concentration, a deep focus to solve a very difficult problem.
If you're a gamber -- you're a couple of nuances around the eyes around the eyes and mouth is a sign of optimism.
The wish brows to above are a text of surprise.
This is a gamber that on the point of something called "epic win."
Ah, you know that. OK, good.
So we have a few gamers under us.
A epic win" is an outside that is so incredibly positive, that you didn't know that it was possible to you.
It wasn't to image.
And when you're there, you're surprised to explore what you really can. That is a "epwin."
This is a gamber on the point of the epic win."
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solved in the world as we try to pick on the next century of the next century.
The face of somebody while, to all the face of all expectations at the point of the epic win."
But unfortunately, we see before this face in the daily every daily as we try to packing.
This is what I call it "I Ben Niet Good in the Lif."
And this is what I actually doesn't do it. Can you see it? Yeah. Good.
This I am the "I Ben Niet Good in the Lif" face.
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my Ph.
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers.
We felt that we're not a good at the reality of the reality that we are.
And I mean not only successful not just successful, even though that part of it.
We reached more in games. But I mean, but I mean, but I mean with good motivated to work together, inspired to work.
And when we're in a game world, I believe that most of us, I believe that most of us the best version of ourselves, the most likely to help.
the most likely to stay as long as it needs to stay with a problem failure, to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and failure.
And if we are in the real life is failed of a failure, when we confront confrigerated with hindernisss, we feel don't feel anything.
We feel about.
We're feeling us, perhaps depressive, frustrated or cynical.
We never have that feelings never if we games play.
they're just not in games.
So that's what I did was when I was student when I was a student.
What part of games makes it impossible that we can't reach everything that we can't reach?
How can we take the feelings of games and take it in the real world applies?
So I looked at games like Word of Warcraft, which is really the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems.
And I started to notice some things that make "epepic wins" in the online world.
The first thing that I noticed is that every time you get in one of that online games come, especially World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters that you like to be a world-rescuing mission.
But not just a mission, a mission, a mission that perfect perfectly in the game. Right?
So, you can do it.
They never give you a challenge that you can't do it.
But it's basically on your possibilities. So you have to try.
But there is no work in World of Warcraft.
You can't do something.
There's always something specifically and importantly,
And there are a lot of contributters.
Each place where you go, there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to help your epical mission.
That is something that we have in real life difficult life, that sense that there's a lot of completely inside us are very much.
And also that there is an epical story, this inspiring story that tells us why we're doing.
And then all the positive feedback that we get.
You've already heard of a life and plus-a force, and plus-a force, and plus-an intelligence.
Solar constant feedbackstream, we don't get in real life.
When I get here from this stage, I'm not going to get down here, I won't get a message of plus a speak idea, plus-20 concerned idea.
And, I don't get in real life.
Now, the problem with collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it's so dance that it's so dance.
It's just better than the reality.
Now, Warcraft players, Warcraft players, all together 5.93 million years, the virtual problems of Azero.
Now, that is not a bad this.
It sounds maybe bad.
To obviously clearly, 5.93 million years ago.
That was the first one, right?
Okay, so if we talk about the amount of time we investing in playing games, is the only way it is the only way it talk about it, is to talk about time in the sense of the human evolution, and talk about time in the context of human evolution, which is a extraordinary show.
But it turns out. Because it turns out, because so many times to play with play of games, we spend to where people are.
We evolve to a kind of cooperative and cooperative.
This is true. I believe this.
So, think about this interesting number.
It became recently by a research of the Carnegie Mellon University.
The average young person today, in a country with a major culture culture, will have 10,000 hours have been burned by 210,000 hours.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons.
First, for children in the United States is 10,00.0.0. hours the exact amount of time that you spending your spending at school from school.
So we have an equivalent job of opened job that younger to learn a lot of learning across the rest in school.
Some of you probably have Malcom Gladwell's book "Outliers."
So you've probably heard of his succestheory, the 10,000 hours succestheory.
It's amazing, cognitive, cognitive scientific research that if we say 10,000 hours to say that if we can control 10,000 hours to be a little bit to be virtuos.
We're going to be good at the best of the world.
And so, what we're seeing now is a whole generation young generation in the games.
So, the great question is, "Where are being gamers are so good at all?"
Because if we can have a virtually unprecedented a virtual represented to human potential.
This is the number of people who now at least one hours a day.
These are our virtuoses.
500 million people who are extraordinary good in something.
And in the next decade, we will have another billion gamers that have more exceptional good at this.
If you don't know it.
The gaming-industry is consoles to the developing industry and need little wireless with wireless telephone networks instead of broadband Internet works so that gamers of around the world, especially in India, China and Brazil.
They expect a billion gamers more to the next decade.
That brings us to 1.5 billion gamers.
So I wonderful that we get through these games that we become such a virtual.
I found business. The first is burning is burning optimism.
OK. This is you can see as extreme self-motivation.
Branied optimism is to act measure measured to act a reason to act a reasonable chance that we have a reasonable opportunity on success.
Gamers believe that a "epic win" possible is possible to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try now.
Gamer's nothing.
Gamers are virtuos in the resource of a close social bat.
There's a lot of interesting research that we've got people played a played with them played them.
The reason is that you need to have a game to play.
We're trusting that they're going to play with us, that they will play the same rules, that they will play the same rule, that they're going to keep the same goal.
So a games with somebody playing the bottom, the trusting and the collaboration.
And as a result, we actually stronger social relationships.
Very productivity.
You know, there's a reason the average World of Warcraft gamer 22 hours a week plays, almost like a week.
That is because we know that when we're a game play play, we're actually happy to work hard than if we design around.
So we know that people are made to make hard, useful work.
And gamers are willing to work hard to work hard.
And eventually, epic meaning.
Gamer's being basically basically based missions, to stories of planetary scale.
So a little bit of clear.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wikipedia, the biggest wikia.
The second largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles, is the World of Warcraft.
Five million people use it every month.
They have more info about World of Warcraft to the Internet on the Internet than any other wiki.
They build a epical story.
They build an epical source of knowledge about World of Warcraft.
Okay, so they're four super forces that are being combinated.
Gamers are super-force, hopeful individuals.
These are people who believe that they believe that they're individual to change the world.
And the only problem is they believe that they're able to change its virtual world and not the real worlds and not the real world.
That is the problem I try to solve it.
There's an economist, Edward Castronova.
He work is brilliant. He searches the reason why people and energy and money and money of money worlds.
And he says, "We're getting anything less than a real mass exoso to virtual worlds and online.
And he's a economist, he's rational.
And he says, not like me, I'm a game designing designer.
But he says that this is completely logically, because gamers can achieve in a world than in real world in the real life.
They can stronger social relationships in games than in real life.
They get better feedback and feel more rewards in games than in the real.
So he says that the perfect logical is that gamers more time in virtual worlds than in the real worlds than in the real world.
Now, I'm going to go to agree each that rational is rational right now.
But it's not an optimal situation.
We need to do the real world more like this.
So I take my inspiration of something about 2,500 years ago.
These are ancient dobits, made out of shocks. OK?
For we had cool controllers had cooles.
And this is the first piece of tools tools for that, designed to play, designed by people.
And if you know the work of the old Greek historian Herodoturs s, you may be this story.
the inventors of the first game, and why they found it.
Herodotus says that game, especially invented with dobits were invented in the circularly Lydia during hungry of hungry.
There's a famine, the hunger, that the kings of Lydia decided to do something.
People suddenly. People fight.
It was an extreme situation. They had to find an extreme solution.
So, he says, Herodotus, they found out of a piece of policy.
One day, every day, everybody.
And the next day, everybody games.
And they might be so basically understanding in their play, because play are so booking, and dompils us under in such a highly productivity, that they were the fact that they had no eat.
The next day, they played games.
The day after them.
And according to Herodotus they did this 18 years.
They survived a hungery by eating one day and played the next day.
Now, I think this is exactly how we use games today.
We're using games to design the real world.
We're using them to design them all broken in the real world is broken in the real world, everything that is not concerned to real real life, and we get what we need from games.
But it doesn't need to end it.
This is very exciting.
And after 18 years of Herodotus didn't better.
So the killing that she decided they would play.
They did the whole kill in two.
They played one, and the winners of that game, and the winners of that played on a epical adventure.
They would leave Lydia, and look for a new living place.
Not enough people to make survive about survive of the life of life of life, and hopefully they could let the civilization of the civilization.
Now, this sound, right?
But recently showed DNA evidence of evidence that the Etrus, who would lead to the Romeins, the same DNA have as the old Lydians.
And so scientists have suggested that Herodot."
And geologists have found evidence of a climate change that almost 20 years.
So this crazy would be true.
It might be that they could rescue their culture to play culture their culture to a game for 18 years, and then so many inspired to be so much about the together and so much about the together.
Okay, we can too.
We play Warcraft since 1994.
It was the first real-time strategy of the World of Warcraft series. That was 16 years ago.
They played with dobits through 18 years, we playing Warcraft during 16 years.
And I say we're ready for our own epic game.
Now, half of the population looking for a new world.
So that's where I game, my 21 billion hours a week.
We're going to half of our each to each an hours a day to get problems in the real world.
Now, I know what you're wondering, "How are we going to solve those problems by gament?" Well, that is what I have dedicated my work on the last few years, at the last few years, at the Institute.
We have a banner in our building in Palo Alto, and the press point our point point of how to deal with the future.
We don't want to predict him.
We want to form it.
We want to imagine the best possible.
And then we want to give people the power to work out that reality.
We want to imagine "epic wins" and then people give the resources to spend their epic win."
I'm going to show you three games that I've been made a attempt to give people the resources to create their own "epic wins" in the future.
OK, this is World Without Oil.
We made this game in 2007.
This is an online in which you have a teck cort of oil tries to survive.
The tecky is fictional, but we stick enough online content to believe that it's really -- and to let you believe that it really is, and to let you real real life as if we started to have any oile. So if you start the game up with you.
And then we give you your real-time images and data fact that you can show you what the exact price of oil is, which is not available to influence, how transportation is influenced, or the schools are influence, or the schools, or the schools.
And you have to figure out how to live your real life as though this was true. And then we start to start a block, to start videos and photographs.
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007.
And we followed the three years,
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.
Nobody wants to change its life is just because it's good for the world or because it's good for the world or because we should do it.
But when you put them into a epical adventually adventure and tells them to say, "We don't have oil anyway."
This is a great story story and adventure to go.
There's yourself to see how to survive.
Most of the players had their habits that they learned in this play.
So, for the next world-rescues play, we decided to get higher.
We made a games called Superstruct at the Institute.
It was that a supercomputer was a supercomputer that people had only still 23 years.
This supercomputer had natural the name Global Extinction Awareness System.
We asked people to get online online, almost as a Jerry Bruckheimer film.
You know, Jerry Bruckheimer films, you get a thream team.
You've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-prisoners, and they have to save the world.
But in our play, we have instead of five people on the dream team, everybody on the thream of team to find the future of energy to find the future of energy, the future of fooding, the future of health, the future of security and the future of security and the future of the future.
We put 8,000 people playing the games for eight week.
They sunning 500 enormous solutions that you can see if you look on Google, "Superstruct."
And then finally, the last game, the last game, we bring it up at three measures in collaboration with the World Bank Institute.
If you speak, you're certified by the World Bank Institute, as a Social Institute, as a Social Institute.
Working with universities about very Zwart Africa, and we need to teach social innovation social innovation skills.
We have a comic business story. We have a system with levels in skills like local, knowledge, sustainability, vision and finds.
And I'd like to share all invite you to share this game to share with young, everywhere in the world, especially in the world, especially in developing areas, that could come together from the world to save the world to save the world to save the world.
So I'm going to figure out now.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think will happen now?
We've already gamers, we have these games that are ideas of what we could do, but no one of what we could do, but no one of them.
Well, I hope you're going to do with me, that gamers, that gamers are a human helps that we can use to help the real world, which we can use to help the real world, which is a powerful platform for change.
We've got all this incredible superpowers, square productivity, the possibility for a dent, social sense of burning burning optimism and the desires to a epic meaning.
I really hope that we can get to play games to play games to play a difference, to survive on this planet.
And my hope is that you're going to do with measure and playing games of games like this.
If I look forward the next decade of decade, I know two things, that we can imagine every future that we can imagine that we can imagine to play that we want.
So, I say, let the world-changed play.
Thank you.
Anyway, I'm interested in the placebo-effect.
That can be weird for a magician, unless you see the same meaning the same meaning of this, that is becoming as meaning is something that is becoming a nice strong through somebody believed that it is really." Met other words, have a measurable effect in decided that is the placebo-effect.
Just because the person in question in question is thinking about a medical resources or something else --
For instance, for example, if there is any strong, it gets dance, it gets a measurable effect, it gets a measure effect, the placebo-effect.
Something is really, because of it is really, because of its perception of it.
To take care that we understand each other, I want to start with you a very simple basic basic basic basic basic basic basic basic basic basic basic basistic.
And I'll show it works. This trick trick trick is certainly since the 1990s.
I learned himself as little guy in the 1990s.
I'm going to do the tricking, after that.
And then I explain why I explain why I explained it.
This is what happens.
I mean, that you can se; my hands you can see.
I'm going to figure out the way in my fithrough this.
I'm going to strop.
And to make sure that there are nothing or from my mom, I'm going to be here in my pols.
This is what you see is that there's no movement.
This is a long time, I can't get anything and from my mome.
The goal is very simple.
I'm going to open my hand and hopefully, if it's good, my magnetism the gnetism on its place.
It's even becoming so much of course, that I can shake it on the ground, and that it doesn't be on the ground.
Nothing or from my mous, or from my mous, and you can get everything else accurate.
Ta-da!
This tricky I love to young children who are in front of young children who are interested because you can learn a lot about misleing.
Even as the trick very simple in each other.
Probably know many of you this transful.
This is what happens.
I love it in my hand.
I say I say I say that my pols, to make sure that there's nothing in and from my mome.
That is money.
The reason I hold my pols, is because of the illusion of the illusion.
At the moment that my hand of your visual moves of your vision front finger of his original place to one that he's positionated.
"Mooi tricking."
This is what it's going to do.
And when I turn, my finger.
We can talk about why this misled, why you can't talk about three fingers.
That's because the brain information, in a way that it doesn't eat, two, three count.
But then it doesn't really do it, right? And then I do my hand.
Of course, it doesn't have the magnetism, but through the present, by the presence of my wisfinger.
And when I hand close my hand close the same thing.
And if I turned again, this movement, this movement that I can did my finger.
I hold this hand away.
A beautifully that you can do for friends and family. Thank you.
Well, what has to do this with the placebo-effect?
About a year ago, I read a research that I read the eyes completely opening.
I am no scientist, so for me, this was amazing.
It turns out that if you did a placebo of the white of a white running around pil that seems to a certain effect.
Make the shape of the placebo change, for example, by making a smaller pile, that you can law colorors and where you get a letter on a letter on the business of effective.
And despite that no one of both applications medicinal medicinal medicinal medicine.
But a white pil is not so good as well.
What? What do I really touch.
But it turns out.
It turns out that capsules are more effective than any kinds of tably.
One colored capsule, given to one and red on the other hand, is better than a white.
Doserving a rol.
A pil twice is not so good as good as three pills; I can't remember the statistics, sorry.
But the point is ...
do a rol.
And the shape is a rol.
And for the ultimate placebo-effect, we need to go to the needle.
Yes, right? A injection of what inert -- a couple of centiliter that you inert in a patient of a patient of inject --
This is a huge powerful image in his mind.
It's a many times stronger than the white pil.
We next times, when we can see slide, when we can slide.
The point is, the white pil is not as good as well, is not so good as good as the capsule, is not so good as the need.
And no real medicinal property.
Only you believe it in your body, it really in your body and creates a stronger effect.
I wanted to see if I could see that idea in a trick of tricking.
I wanted to take something that clearly clear a tricky, and it really let lat.
We know of that research that when you want reality you want reality, you have to understand to the needle.
This is a near of nearly 18 centimeter. She's flish.
I'm going to get her a bit of sterilizes here.
This is really my meat. This is not a special so.
This is my skin. This is not Hollyword special effect.
I'm going to put my skin and this needle through my arm, until I pick through.
If you're admitial legs -- or if you're easily falls -- I did this trick in a couple of friends and also what people I don't know.
A woman woman went almost of her sticky.
So I imagine that if you're admitted to you, that you're the next 30, you know, the next 30.
You can look at it, but also look away if you want.
This is what happens.
I mean, I take a small gone.
Sorry, man. Do you make this miss?
And then through my skin a piece and then through the other side.
Well, in essentially, we are in the same situation like the same situation.
A sort of thing.
But you can count my fingers, right?
I'm showing them here. Here's one, two, three, four.
Yeah.
I know people think if they see this.
They think, "He is certainly enough to put itself a few minutes for a few minutes of his public entertainment of his audience.
How does it look lik? Because good.
Yeah, I know. The people back in the room saying, "OK, that I don't real." And in the other room.
Let me show you this from close.
That's really my skin. That is not Hollywood special effect.
That is my meat. I can turn the windown.
Sorry. If you become too much and not look at that thing.
People behind the room or people look at the room of the images will say, "That look like a beautiful special effect, but if it was a really special effect, it would be a hole and there. If it would be really, he would be blood flower.
Yes, there's it.
And normalized now I would remove now.
I would get my arm, and I would show you that there are no wound.
But in this context and with the idea of something that is taking and actually make it really, let me just sit the needle and I went from the stage.
And the next days I'll see you.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I know a lot of fish in my life.
And I've only two consistance.
The first thing that seemed to a passionate affair.
It was a beautiful fish, good structure, good structure, a best-seller on the human.
What a fish.
Anyway, it was pretty fish to the suppoint of sustained sustainability.
So you felt your well.
I had a relationship with this beauty.
On a day called the head of company and asked me if I wanted to speak on a equired about the sustainability of the crity.
"Absolut."
Here was a company that was tried to solve that this is incredible problem for our cooks.
How do we fish on us?
In the last 50 years, we've got the sea last 50 years.
It's difficulty distance.
90 percent of the great fish, which we love the tonans, the sacrobots, the swordfish, the swordfishments.
There's almost nothing.
So, how whether how bad it's going to be aquaculture, aquaculture, becomes part of our future,
Although there are a lot of arguments.
Because polluts, most of them pollutions, most of them althans, they are inefficient --
A great least point.
It has a food conversion of 15 at 1.
That means that there wanted to put a fish needed to get a pound.
Not very sustainable.
And it doesn't take very well.
So here was a company company that it was good.
I wanted to support them.
The day before I called the head PR of the company.
Let's call him.
"Don," I said, "Don't be familiar to be familiar to be familiar in a way."
"That right," he said, "We're so far out of the coast, that the fish of our fish and not concentrat."
And he added to say, "We're in fact, we have a world on itself.
That food conversierations? 2.5 to 1,," he said, "Bost in the business."
2.5 to 1, wonderful.
"2.5 against one wat? What do you fe?"
"Durazle proteins," he said, "He said,
"Great," I said, "And I said the phone down.
And that night let me long and I thought, what is in Godd in a sustainable protein?
So the next day, I called Don.
I said, "Don, what are examples of sustainable protest?"
He said he didn't know it. He said around.
So I've been on the line with a number of people in the company.
Nobody could give me a clear answer.
until I finally, the main biologist on the line biologist.
Let's just call it Don it.
"Don," I said, "What are a few examples of sustainable protein?"
All right, he called some fishing and a few fishments, and then he said chicpbally.
And I said, "Kipbally?"
He said, "Yeah, skin, skiles, shape, dried and working."
And I said, "What percentage of your follow?"
eight, two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent."
And I said, "Don, what's sustainable to fis?"
There was a long pack on the line and he said, "There's just too much to the world."
My love for this fish.
No, not because I have a self-encountable.
I am down.
No, I love my love for this fish for this fish, I swear, after that conversation, the fish.
This second fish, that's a very different story.
It's the romantic species, the kind of the kind of where you get more of your fish.
I've been first in a restaurant in a restaurant in south Spanje.
A friend journalist journalist spoke about this fish.
She has a whether more or less.
He came back in the table, basically, almost global, white color, white color.
The cooking it cooks.
Almost two times.
Something amazing out of this.
Who can do a fish so well-basically?
I don't, but this follow.
Let's call him.
Actually, his name is also Miguel.
And no, he didn't cooked the fish, and he's not cook.
And at least not in the way you and I understand.
He's a biologist in Veta La Palma.
That is a fish in the southern of Spanje.
On the point of the Gaudalquivi.
Because the 1980s, the cracross of Argentinean.
They shocked running on what was drawn.
They did through the country.
They built a complex channels and they push the water of the country the water of the country.
It doesn't want to do them, but not economic.
And ecologically, it was a disaster.
90 percent of the birds went down.
what, for this place, a lot of birds.
And so in 1982 a Spanishing environmental country.
What did they did it?
They turned the water stream.
They literally put the buttton.
Instead of pushing water out, they use the channel, they use the channel.
They put the channels underwater.
They created a 1,100 hectare great fishing -- bars, harder, garning -- and at the same time -- and his business -- and his businessed the ecological return.
The cutting is wonderful.
I mean, you have never seen like this.
You look at the horizon that infinitely far away and all around, and everywherever you see this thick, and this diky points.
Not as long ago I was there with Miguel.
He's an amazing, three-quarter Charles Darwin and one quarter Crocodile Dundree.
OK? There are knowledge through the drasland, I put down to my knext, modeliver, and Miguel calm gives a biologiles.
Here he pointed to a rare black-Schouder.
Now he's point to the mineral needs of the phyton.
And here, here he sees a group spatry that was doing on the Tanzanian giraffer to the Tanzanian gone.
It turns out that Miguel the biggest part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he was become such a fish expert.
He said, "Fis? I don't know.
I'm a relationship expert."
And when he talked about talking about self-further birds and beyond water plants.
Don't wrong me wrong me wrong. It was really fascinating, a kind of biological community.
It was great, but I was great.
And my head basically basically piece of piece that I had the night before I had the night.
So I said, "Well, I said, "Miguel, how does it that your fish?"
He know.
"I know it, the phytoply, the phytopland, the phytoplanguton, the relationships.
But what eat?
What is the food conversieration?"
And then he's going to tell me that it's such a rich system, that the fish system, that the fish, that the fish.
The plantside biomassa, the phytoplong, the animal plankton, which is what the fish.
The system is so healthy, it's full self.
There is no fun.
And heard of a farm that doesn't do it?
And later that day, I read about this terrain with Miguel and asked him, I said, "For a place that natural looks like this, of course every ququickly where I've ever before, "How do you measure suces?"
Because that moment was like a movie regular regular regar.
And we went to the corner and saw the most wonderful face, thousands and thousands of course flamingos, literally a pink carpet for side you look at it.
"That's success."
"Look at their buds, rock.
They are party."
Fast? I was totally confused.
And I said, "Migual, they're not on your fis?"
"Yes."
"We're running 20 percent of our fish.
Last year had this area of 600,000 birds, more than 250 different species.
It's now the biggest and one of the most important private birdflight species.
And I said, "Miguel, is a bird population that doesn't does the last thing you want on a fish?"
He did his head, no.
He said, "We are extensive, not intensive.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos eat the garnals.
The garnals eating the phytoplong.
So the same thing, the sky, the better the system."
OK, let's take a naging.
One craft that are animals, and a quicky that are success is measured to measure of his hunters.
A fish, but also a bird type.
Oh, by the way, that flamingos, which would actually be completely here.
They passed in a village, 250 kilometers, where the bottom conditions are better to build nests.
Every morning they fly 250 kilometers down to the clean.
And every night, they flies back.
They do that because they can do that because they can follow the bottom.
No joke.
And I put a penguin, so I looked at Migual.
And I said, "Miguel, do they fly 250 miles back to the clean, and then 250 kilometers back.
Do they do that for the guys?"
He looked at me like a Whitney Houstone Whitney Houstently.
He said, "No, they're going to do the food."
I didn't have the skin of my love fish, which was wonderful, and I don't like fishing fish.
I don't like this.
It is that wrange, highly.
I also cool with them.
But when I took him in that south restaurant in southern Spanje, he didn't look at all the way at fish.
He clean and cleaning and clean out of the ocean nam.
And I said that to Miguel and he's cool.
He said, "The skin works like a spones.
It's the last defense before something the body.
He's evolved to success."
And then he added to say, "But our water has no water did."
OK. OK. OK. OK.
A quote that are success measure that are success.
And then I realized that when he said, a claim when he said, a claim that doesn't have a big understatement, because the water that the water that through the flows of the Guadalquiver river.
That is a rivers of everything that community of everything that river to take up with the day, chemical restants, chemical restants.
And while it is through the system and clean, is the water.
The system is so healthy that the water.
So not only a question are animals ants animals that are success that are success that are success to the health of its refrooms, but a claim that are literally.
And not just for those fish, but also for you and me.
Because if the water road, it's in the Atlantic ocean.
A drop in the ocean, I know it, but I take it, but I take it to do, because this love love story, because this love story, although romantic -- is also learning --
You can say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we talk about best.
What we need is a radial new agricultural concept, one in which the food, in which the food is actually good corn.
But for many people is that a little bit too radical.
We're not realists, we have a fine provers.
We're love mountains.
We love of farmermarkets.
We love little family companies.
We talk about local food.
We eat organic.
And if you suggest that these are the things that are the future of good food food, then somebody and says, "He guy, I like a guy, and says, "He guy, I love road flamingos, but how do you do the world fee?
How do you feed the world?"
Do I have honest?
I don't like that question.
No, not because we're already calready cories to feed the world.
One billion people today.
One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of the great inequality in distribution, not the amount.
I don't like this question because she's determined by the logics of our food system of the last 50 years.
Because of rebifulls, pesticians of monocultures, chemicals to fish, chemicals fishments, and the whole agribusiness, "If we asked agribusiness: "If we asked more people feet, how do do it be?"
That's the motivationation.
It's been the right.
It's been the entrepreneurl, of the U.S. agriculture.
We'd need to call it is, an entrepreneur in liquidation, which is an entreprentreprened.
That is not an agriculture.
Our daily every daily bread now is threat, but by cute, not by the last combined sources, not by the last combine and tractor, but by critical country, but by cractable, not by cractable, but by cractable, not by fisheries, but by fishere, but by fish.
Would you feel the world do?
Let's start with the question: how do do we feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create conditions where every communities can feed itself?
To do that, look at the agribusiness model for the future.
It's old and it's old and it's deploying.
It leep on money, chemicals and machines, and machines, and machines, and it has never been produced.
Let's see instead, let's look at the ecological model.
That is the model that trusts on two billion years of in-job experience.
Look at Migule, crafts like Miguel, crafts that are not own world's restoring instead of restoring instead of having instead of courses that are instead of exhaustomers that are not only intensive, but intensive, experts in relationship in relationship in relationship in relationships, because they are experts.
And if I'm very honest, they're a better than I'll be a better than I'm ever going to be.
You know, I find the primary, because if that the future of good is food-food, it's pretty food.
Thank you.
I grew up on a constant diet of science fiction.
At the front of education, I went up with the bus to school, and back, every day.
And I was always absorbed by a book, a science fiction fiction book, which meme in mind to other worlds, and that, in narrative curious news.
And, you know, the curious manifestablished in the fact that I was always when I was not at school, I was in the forest, I was collected in the forest, walking and collectors, snasts, snaves and water water, and she came back to the microscope.
You know, I was a real science.
But it was all about understanding the world, the bounds of the world, the bounds of possible understand.
And my love science fiction, seemed to be mirror in the world, because what was happened in the world, because what was happening, this was the end of the sea year, we went to the moon, we were going to be exploring the deep oceans of oceans, Jacques Cousteau came within with front of fantastic world and a wonderful of wonderful world that we could never see a wonderful world that we could never before.
This seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction.
And I was an artist.
I could draw. I could paint.
And because there were no video games and these pictures and these pictures and all these images and all these images in my head, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, that we all had to read the book we all had a book and read book and based on the basis of the description of the author, and based in our head.
And my reaction was: painting out of this: paintings outside worlds, robots, spaceships, spaceships, spaceships, spaceships, spaceship, all of things.
I became constantly constantly sketched at behind myself,
That was the creativity that had to figure out.
And something interesting happened to be interesting, the Jacques Cousteau programs, made me excited me about the fact that there was a alian alien world was just here on the Earth.
And I would probably not really going to go to a spaceship world on a day in a spaceship.
That seemed to pretty unlikely.
But that was a world where I could actually go to the world where I could just go to here on Earth, which was so rich, and exotic exotic imagined by reading those books.
So I decided to be done on 15 years.
And the only problem with that, that I was in a little village in Canada lived in Canada, 600 miles of the nearest ocean.
But, I didn't let me cross.
I went to my father until he ended up a substantly in Buffalo, New York, just about the boundary that we live.
And I left my certify, in a swimming of a YMCA, middle in the winter, in Buffalo, New York.
And I saw the ocean, a real ocean, not just two years later, when we moved to California.
Since then, in the between 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours of doing about 3,000 hours of that, and 500 hours of that, and 500 hours of that.
And I learned that the deep-sea deep oceans, and even the undeep oceans, so wealthy of amazing our imagination.
The image force of nature is so boundation, compared to our limity, human imagination, human imagination.
At this day, I've been crossing size for what I see doing these during thing.
And before the ocean running love for the ocean is just as still as she was ever before.
But when I was a filmmaker.
And that seemed to tell the best way to tell the drive I had to tell stories, to combined with my drive images.
And as a child I was always with drawing comic books, etc.
Films, the way to make images and stories. And that seemed together. And that seemed it.
And of course, the storytelling, that I can, science fiction fiction story: "Terminator," "Aliens," and "The Abys."
And with "The Abyss," I brought my love for underwater and diving films.
Say me, the two passions combinating.
Something interesting from "The Abyss," which was to solve a specific story story technology story to solve a specific problem in that film, the creating a fluence of fluid water.
And this resulted in the first soft surface character, CG animation, CG animation, who have ever put in a film.
And even despite that the movie never money, it was a break-break-break-breakful, I have to say, that was that the audience, that was the audience, that was the audience, the global public magic.
You know, it's Arthur Clarke's knows, that each advanced that each advanced technology is not too magic.
They saw something magical.
And I became very excited from that.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that has to be in the movie."
So, with "terminator, 2," what was my second film, we went down here.
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal metal refilm. The success of the film. The success of it would work.
And that did it. And we created again.
And we had the same result with the audience.
All we make a little bit more money on that film.
So, to pull a line between who experience two points of experience, this is a whole new world, a whole new world, a whole new world of creativity for filmartions.
So I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who's most makeup, and called called Domain, and creatures was in that time and it was called and it was called in that time and it was called --
And the concept of the company was that we might do a jump, in the analog processes of optical production, and we might directly directly on digital production.
And we actually did that we actually did a competition.
But we found ourselves, the middle of the 1990s, in the middle and character design corner design, which we had originally showed it up.
So I wrote this piece of called "Avatar," that means was to be absolutely absolutely the borders of visual effects, from CG effects, with realist human emotional characters would be generated in CGGGGive carakters would all be in CGGGGGGGDkar's bounds, and the world are duning back.
And I became told by the people in my company, that we won't be able to do this.
So I put it in the cools and I made that different film about a big that sense.
I sold it to the studio als: "Romeo and Juliet."
It becomes an epic romantic, passionate film.
And what I was doing was doing, I wanted to go to the real wonderful called "Titanic."
And that's why I made the movie.
And that is the truth. Echter, the studio know that not.
But I said, "We're going to be convinced to the work.
We will use it in the opening of the film.
It will be very important. It will be a great marketing high.
I convinced them to figure out an expedition.
Because this comes back to the theme of your imagination.
Because we actually created a real reality that I found six months later in a Russian submarined, two and a half mile, in the northern Atlantic ocean, in the northern Atlantic ocean, look at the real Titanic through a pattern, not a film, HD, but not really.
There I was completely about that.
And the require a lot of preparation, we had to develop cameras developing and lights and all kinds of things.
But the view of how much these deep divies, these deep dives look like space temissions.
You know, there's a very technical and it was very technically, and the distant enormous planning.
And you put in such a capsule, you put in this dark enemy environment where there is no hope on rescue where there is no hope if you can't get back.
And I thought, "Wow, it seems I'm in a science fiction film.
This is very cool."
And so, I had the flooring of the deep ocean.
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it.
It was everything. It was incuriosity. It was imagination. And it was imagination. And it was an experience that Hollywood could not give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature, and we could imagine a visual effect." But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of that window.
And as we did a number of our next expeditions I saw creatures and sometimes things I've never seen before, and sometimes things I've never seen before that have never seen before, who had never seen before by the science we saw they've ever seen them.
So I was completely by this.
And so I made a strange decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I said, "OK, I said, "OK, I'm going to be a while filmmaker, and I'm going to be a while.
And so we started planning these expeditions.
And we finally went to the Bismark, and explored it with robotic vehicle.
We went back to the write of the Titanic.
We took little bit of small "bots" that we had created out of that glass.
And the idea was to go within and a interior an interiorge of that ship, which is never done before.
No one had ever been looked in the wheel. They had the resources to do it, so developed the resources to do it.
So, here I am now, here, on the work of the Titanic, sitting in a submarines and look outside, and look outside a lot of this, where I knew that the bone.
And I put a small robotic vehicle.
And when I say I say that I awarenessed him in the vehicle, I felt like I felt physically, I felt physically, within the ship of the Titanic.
And it was the most surreal kinds of experience that I have ever before I ever had before, because I had a corner to do what would be, for the lights of the vehicle, because I had the lights on the set of the set of the film.
And the set was like an exactly replica on the blueprushed of the ship.
So it was an absolutely remarkable experience.
And it did me realize that the telepresentation, that you can actually have this kind of robotic nature that you can have consciousness, where you can be consciousness in the vehicle, in this other shape.
It was really pretty deploying.
And then maybe a little bit of a look at what could happen, which is decades, what decade as "cyborn available for exploration or other, in many kinds of post-human future, which I can imagine a science fiction fance.
So, this expeditions, and really starting to get what was doing down there, what was down there, like the deep ocean, like the deepe ocean, where we had these amazingly amazing amazing.
They're practically extraordinary beings just here on Earth.
They live in a environment of chemosynthese.
They don't live in a sunlight based system as we do.
And so you see animals that life next to 500 degrees Celcius him next to water.
You might think they could be impossible.
On the same moment I was very interested in very much interested in space science fiction in space science, again.
And I got involved in the space community, very involved in NASA, particular space to the NASA advicational space, I went to Russia, I went to Russia, I went to Russia, I went to the pre-cosamples and all that kinds of things, and already in the international space of our 3D camera systems.
And this was fascinating.
But what the final result result that I was scientists with our community to the depth.
And they take access so that they had access to astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in that extreme environment, they were down to the extreme environments and look at the sources.
So, here, we were documentary films films, but actually also we actually do science to do science space science at space science to do it.
I made the circle of the circle of the science fiction fant, you know, as a child and all this.
And you know, during this journey of discovery, I learned a hope.
I learned a lot of science. But I also leadered a lot of leadership.
Now you might think that a regular director should be a leader to be a leader of the ship and that kinds of things.
I don't really learned about leadership until I did that expeditions.
Because I had to say, "What do I do?
Why do I do this? What do I do this?"
We don't deserve money with this damned programs.
They're narely break-even. There is no fair.
People think I'm going to be gone between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avatar" and "Avatar."
I made all these films, all these documentaries for a very limited audience.
no glory, no glory, no money. What are you doing?
You do it for the work itself, for the challenge, and the ocean is the most exciting environment of the exciting of the exciting of the discovery, and the strange that weird band that weird benefit as a small shape.
Because we did all these things with 10-12 people working for years.
Sometimes for 2-three months.
And through that band, you realize that the most important thing that you have the respect is that you have a task for them, and that said you can't have a task that you can't explain, which you can't explain somebody else.
When you go back to way, and you say, "We had to do this and the fiber and the fiber optic and the demption, and the demping, and this is all the technology and the difficulty of the technology of working on the sea legist of working on the sea thing that maybe political politagents or people have explained in the subject that have never explains that have never explain.
That creates a band, creates a band of respect.
So when I came back to make my next movie, which "Avatar," I was trying to make the same principle of leadership of leadership, which is that you respect your team respect.
And that changed the dynamics.
So, there was a little team, there was a small team in map a little team, "Avatar," "Avatar," "Avatar."
Enorm exciting.
Enorm.
And we became a family, for a period of four and a half years.
And it changed how I make movies.
So, people gave commentors on how you, say, the ocean organisms, the ocean organisms and put it on the planet.
And for me, it was a fundamental way, the process itself, the process itself, that changed that changed.
So, what can we get out of all this synthes?
You know, what are the lessing?
Well, I think number is curiosity.
It's the powerful what you're own.
Imagination is a force that can actually manifest.
And the respect of your team is more important than all the line in the world.
There are young filmmakers who come to me, and say, "Give me what advice to do this."
And I say, "Leg yourselves.
Other people are going to do that for you, doing yourself, not to do it yourself.
And take risos."
NASA has told this where they are, "Misling is not option."
But failed has to be an option in art and discovery, because it's a discovered in the deep.
And not a single important enterprise that innovation is done without risk.
You have to be willing to take those risks.
And that is the thought that I'd like to leave you, that in whatever you do, failure, but not. Thank you.
If I give you one today a big idea, it's a big idea that we use, bigger of the data that we use, larger than the parts.
And instead of thinking about information, I want to think about how we can use information to think about how we can use information to take patterns and trends that else.
This is a typical mortal.
The tool, I use this is an experiment.
It's called Pivot. With I can filter on a certain species, for instance.
I see immediately different pattern are coming.
That's because here in the middle people are the most active, and there's the vulnerable.
We can put again outside and the data reorganize of the reorganize of this.
We're seeing that heart disease and cancer.
If we go beyond and filter, for example, 40 years or young, we see that unclear the biggest causes.
If you put a deeper deeper there, that especially for men.
You can see what I mean, in this ways look at this ways look at this ways look at information in a living infographic.
If we can do this, why can't do this.
What we have, the front page of every number of number of Sports Illustrated that ever made it.
Everything is here. It's all on the net.
You can go to your room to your room and this after my talk.
With Pivot on a decade.
You can zoom in a particular years.
You can go to a certain number of number jump.
I'm looking at this. I see the athlets that are different in this numbers in this number, the sports.
I am fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click, and that gives me all the numbers where Lance Armstrong.
And if I just want to look at this, I think quickly, I think, "Why not all the wheeling?"
I'm doing a step back and go back and go back.
Now, I see Greg Lemond.
You can see that if you launch this way through information, and broader, and broader, and then you don't see.
You do something that is a little differently.
It's before, and we think it changes, and we think it changes how you can use information.
So I want to pull it a little bit further.
Here we've taken every page of Wikipedia, and she's limited to a little small together.
And the society of a small systems and a icobig to give the subjects.
I'm just showing you the top 500 popular Wikipedia page.
But even in this limited case we can do.
We get immediately an idea of the subjects that are the popular on Wikipedia.
I'm going to beyond and government.
Now, I chose government, I see the Wikipedia categories that the Wikipedia categories, Time magazine Mens of J.
This is very important because this invision of Wikipedia page.
You can only get it through a step back and look at them.
If I look at one of these societies I can look at the understanding on the understanding Time magazine Person of the year through them.
One of all these people learning me that the majority is coming out of the politics.
Some of course, from nature sciences.
A smaller comes from the business world.
There's my bad.
One comes from the music world.
What interesting is that Bono also a TED Prize-win.
So we can spring to all the TED Prize winners.
So we navigate the Web as if it's really a web as if it's really a web of page, not from page to page on a higher abstractienive.
I want to show you another thing that you may be surprise that you may be surprise.
I show here the website of the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser cally, but you can see web page, but you can see web pages -- we bring this zoomble technology to every webpage, like this.
I'm going to go back a step back and back back and back in a specific section.
And the reason why this important, is that I just started looking at the webpages, I can look at my whole browse-history history in the same way to look at the same way.
And I can see a deeper what I've done in certain period.
Here's the status of the status of the status of the demo,
I can play some things that I've been looking at today.
If I put a step back and everything, I can see my historically cutters maybe based on my search history of my search history.
Here, I did what nepotistic research research Bing, and here Labs Pive Labs Pivot.
And then from there, I can get a deeper on the page, and they're again.
It's one metaphor that is getting again, and every times it makes the bigger than the such of the parts of the data.
Today, in our world, we see data like a flow.
We talk about the liquid of information.
We talk about drink in data.
If we could put that on his head, and the web on its head, and the Web, so that instead of starting from one thing to go from one thing to go to the next that we can see from many things, and the patterns that would be differently.
If we can't do that, we can't figure out in data, we can really information.
And instead of working with information, we may knowledge of it.
If we have knowledge, maybe even wisdom.
Thank you very much.
Everybody talks about happiness.
I mean, somebody's number of books that the youngest five years with "happiness" in the title and he's talking about 40s, and there were a lot of about 40, and there were a lot of it.
There's a lot of interested in researchers.
There's a lot of happiness.
Everybody wants to make people happy.
But despite that massas work there are different cognitive valences that make it impossible impossible to think about happiness.
And I'm going to have today about that cognitive cognitive piece.
This is true people who are talking about their own happiness, and it's true for researchers who think about happiness, because it turns out that we're just as in the way.
One of the early is the narrow of complexity to give complexity.
It turns out the word is just not a useful word is not a useful word too many things.
I think there's one certainly meaning that we might constraining it, but everything that we must have considered this is something that we need to give the more complicated vision of whatever.
The second value is the confusion between experience and memory, that comes down on the difference between between happy in your life.
And these are two totally different things that are in one lots of hope in the concept.
And the third valence is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can't think about a circumstance.
I mean, this is a cognitive pile.
There's no way to get this.
Now, I'd like to begin with an example of somebody who during a question, and answer after one of my lectures a story.
And this was the story.
He said he had to go to a symphony shows and that it was absolutely fantastic music, and the end of the recording was a terrible crossing sound.
And then he said, really completely entire experience, that this was the whole experience.
But it doesn't right.
It had the reminds of the experience.
He had the experience.
He had 20 minutes fantastic music.
And those were nothing that because he was remember because he was reminded with a remintion; the remember, and the remember was already, and the remember was already.
What this point is that we could see ourselves and others can see as two persons.
There's an experience I who live in the present, and knowing it and knows, which is able to experience, but those who are in creature.
The doctor to our experience I -- you know, as the doctor, "Does the doctor, "Does now when I touch you here?"
And then it remembering I remember and I is remembering the state and the story of our lives and the story of our life, and that is the person to who ask the doctors as he asks the last time?"
or "How was your journey," or something.
Those are two very different things, the experience I remember and the confusion between both is part of the made that made is made of the made that made is made of happiness.
And I remember is a teller.
And that really begins with a fundamental respons of our reminds -- it starts immediately.
We don't just tell not only storytelling the stories.
Our memory tells us, told us, which is to say, what we can say of our experience is a story.
And let me start with one example.
This is an old.
Those are real patients that are a painful ingre.
I save you the detaile. This is not a painful more, but it was painful when this research in the '90s.
They had to report every 60 seconds about their pain.
And these are two patients.
These are their declass.
And it is asked most of them, "Who of they've had?"
And that's a very easy question.
It's obviously that patient is that patient.
His colonoscopy has taken longer, and for every minute, and for each minutes a patient, and more.
But here is another question: How many patients?
And what a surprise is that patient is that patient is a much bad remember remember than patient B.
And the stories of the colonoscopies because a very important part of the story is very important part of the stories -- and no of these stories is very inspires -- but one of them is determined -- but one of them is particularly ... but one of they're worse than the other.
And the worse story is the story story where the pain which the pain the end.
That's a quality story.
How do we know that? Because we know these people after their colonoscopy, and a lot of later, and a lot of later, everything at each other?"
and it was much worse for B, in their remind.
Well, this is a directly conflict conflict between the experience.
From the point of the standpoint of the point of the point of the standpoint.
Well, what you might do with patient A, and we actually have been doing with patient, and that is happened, and that's happened, and it works, and you could do the colonoscopy of patient, and you could get the colonoscopy without of the tube.
And that makes the patient patient pain line, but not a lot less than being a lot less than before.
And if you keep that a few minutes have a few minutes of the experience, and you've been made it for a much better because you have a much better because you have a much better because your patient now is a better story about his experience.
What did a story?
And that's true for stories that memory, and it's also true, and it's also true, and it's also true.
What a story story is changes, important moments and ends.
Eindes are very important and in this case, it was the end of the important.
Well, the experience I live continue.
It has the moments of experience, the one after other.
And you ask, what happens to these moments?
And the answer is really simple.
They're lost.
I mean, most of the moments of our life -- I mean, you know, the psychological counts -- you know, the psychological reminutes, says.
That meaning, you know, in a life you have about 600 million
In a month there are about 600,000.
Most not a speak to a speak of this.
On most becomes totally no attention to the remind by the way.
And yet you get the impressure that they should be the impressure that they should be from being the experience moments of the experience moments.
It is the end.
And how you use that seems to be relevant to be relevant to be relevant for us.
So I remember and I remember and it's really completely different.
The biggest difference between both in time.
From the point of the standpoint of the vacation, and is the second week, and is the second week of two weeks of weeks two weeks to weeks two weeks so well as good as the vacation of one week.
It doesn't work for the reminded I remember.
For the remember I is a vacation of two weeks better than the vacation of one week because there are no new memories.
You can't changed.
And the critical variable, the critical variable, which is a reminded of a experience.
Tike a very few impact on this story.
It remember than remember and stories.
It's the person who decisions, when you take a patient, if you have a patient, say, two colonoscopies and have to decide two colonoscopies and have to decisions and have to decide what he elected with the least bad with the least bad with the least bad of bad remember, and that is the surgeon.
The experience I have no voice in this choice.
We don't experience between experiences.
We pick between reminded to experience." And even if we think about the future than we don't think about our future as an experiences.
We're thinking about our future.
And you can actually look at this as follow as a dictature of the dictature, and you can remind the experience, and you can remember the experiences that the experience I didn't need the experience I don't need the case that if we go with vacation, which is the case that if we go acquired to the biggest part of our remember.
And that's pretty hard to responsible I think.
I mean, how do we use our remintions?
That's one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the dominance.
And when I think about a vacation that I think about a vacation that we had a few years ago, in Antarctica who had been clear our best vacation, and I think it was clear our best vacation.
And I probably my reminded to the reminds of three weeks three weeks for about 25 minutes, the last four years.
Now, if I have opened the map of 600 photographs in here, I would have a hour.
So these are three weeks and that is almost othern other.
There's a discrepance.
Now, perhaps I'm a little bit extremely, you know, in the limited hunger that I have reminded to use, but even if you do that fail is doing is the hambing question: Why do we make so much importance of the importance that we hear?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment.
Now, imagine that you know on your next vacation, that at the end of the vacation, all your pictures will be become destroyed your pil that your memory, and you get a pill that you're not going to remember.
Would you choose the same vacation? And if you could choose another vacation is a conflict between you.
and you have to think about how you conflict.
That is not that self, because if you think in terms of time you get in terms of time.
And if you think in terms of reminded you may get answer answer answer.
And why we choose the fakes that we choose is a question that we choose confront us with a choice.
Now, the two I lead to two notions of happiness.
There are really two shapes of happiness that we can apply, one per me.
So you can ask questions: how happy is the experience?
And then you would ask the question: how happy are the moments in life of experience?
And they're all -- the happiness of moments is a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
By the way, today we're able to get a pretty good idea of good idea of good idea of happiness I through the time.
If you ask to the happiness of the remember I is that a totally different thing.
This is not about how happy somebody lives.
It's about how text whether the person is like the person is as that talk about her life.
Total different concept.
Everybody who are made these concepts on a lot of throw of the study of happiness, and I hear to a group of students that have been a long students that made long times of the students that have been a zoom of happiness of happiness in this way.
The distinction between the happiness of experience I remembering and the entertainly recently to measure the two several separately, the Gallup Organization does a global pile of more than half a million people ask about their life and questions about what they think about their life.
And there are more efforts in that send in that sense,
So the last few years, we start to reach insight in happiness in the happiness of the two.
And the most important lesson that we've learned each other.
You can know how teves somebody with his life is and that life is really feel about how happy he lives his life.
Just to give you an idea of the correlation of the correlationship is about 0.5.
That means that if you shouldn't get somebody and say that his father is a meter, how much would you know about his length?
You'd know about his length, but there is a lot of uncertainty.
And so much uncertainty, you know, if I tell you that somebody gives you a lot of 10, you've got a lot of about how happiness they are about their experience.
So the correlation is weak.
We know about what the text I think about what the teving.
We know money is very important.
We know that happiness is that happiness is that we mostly mostly with people that we move, with people that we move.
There are other enough, but this weight?
So if you want to maximalize the two I want to maximalize that it will turn that you see very different things.
The conclusion of what I'm saying here is that we shouldn't be happiness as a substitute.
It's a completely different concept.
And then now -- another reason -- another reason why we cannot think about happiness is that we can't think about the same things when we think about life, and if we think about life, and if we think about life.
So if you ask the simple question how happy people in California you're not going to get the right answer.
If you ask that question, you think people have to be happy in California if you lived in California if you live.
And what happens when you think about life in California, you think about the contrast California and other places and other places and that contrast climate.
And it turns out it climate is not so important to the experience I don't even think about how happiness I decided that how happy.
But I think of think, I can turn the boss is that you can turn -- that some people move to California.
And it's quite interesting to go after what is going to happen with people who are going to go to California in happy.
Well, their experiencing itself.
That know.
But one thing happens anything. They think they're lucky, because if they think about it, because when they think about it is reminded how to remind it again.
And they will think they have made the right decision.
It's very difficult to think about right, and I hope to think about well, and I hope that I've given you a sense of how point it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I ask you.
Thank you very much.
When we told a couple of weeks ago, you told me that there was a very interesting of that Gallup.
Can you share you with us sharing a few minutes about a few minute?
Daniel Kahneman: Well, I think the most interesting result result in the Gallup-petation is a number that we didn't had absolutely expected.
It has to do with the happiness of experience.
If we look at how feelings differences of differences
It turns out under the income borders of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, and then it goes around Americans, and it's about 600,000 dollars a big representative steel, with a big representatives of the 600,000 dollars a year.
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 60,000 dollars a year, than people are accidents, and they're being armer.
We see a follower line.
I mean, I mean, I've seen a flat lines.
It's obviously, what's happening is that money you can't experience happiness but that a lack of money you made that a lack of money and we can get these foots with great precision.
For the other I remember -- you get a very different story.
How more money you make a lot of money you know.
That doesn't remotion.
CA: But Danny, the whole American pursued on life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness.
And when people results that results are taking results to put everything on his head, saying what we believe what we believe about say, fiscal policy and so on.
Is there a chance that politicians, that the country in general result in general result and the public politicians would basically?
DK: You know, I think that there is recognition of happiness of the role of happiness.
That recognition will come into the United States in the United States, that is not a doubt, but in the United Konincurity.
People recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policy.
And it will take a time, and people will debate about the question or whether they want to study, whether they want to study or the evaluation of life want to study, so we will have to do that debate quickly.
How we increase happiness is all different dependent of how you think and whether you think about the experience I whether it's experience.
This is the policy influence in the next years, I think.
And in the United States are done to measure the experience happiness of the population.
And I think that will be about a year or a year or part of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems me that this subject is the interesting thing that is the interesting, or should be the next few years.
Thank you very much for your invention of the behavioral economics.
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
And that seems to be a little bit of surprising because my full-time work at the full-time work with vaccines and sloads, about the things we need to figure out and help the poorest two billion people.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, in fact, in fact, which is more important than who on this planet.
It climate climate so that their crops are not going to be grow.
There will be a lot of a lot of rain.
Things will change their vulnerable environmental environment.
And that lead to hungry. It lead to uncertainty.
So the climate change the climate change.
The price of energy is extremely important for them.
In fact, if you could get only picked only to make the poverty, to make poverty the poverty to reduce the poverty of power.
The energy price is distile on the dom.
Anyway, advanced civilization is based on the progress in energy.
The voices carbon revolution led to the industrial revolution, and even in the 20th century, and even in the 20th century for electricity, and so many of electricity, and we have coelectricitions, we can make modern materions, we can modern modern materials and make so many things.
And we have a beautiful situation with electricity in the rich world.
Well, now we're making the cheaper -- and let's make the two times as cheaper -- then there's a new limitation, and make a new limitation, and create with CO2.
CO2 leads to warming the planet, and the equation of CO2 is actually a very simple.
If you operate, the CO2 that is the CO2, that leading to a temperature, and that temperature, leading to a number of very negative effects.
The effects of again, perhaps, the indirect effects, the indirect effects, that the natural ecosystems cannot adaptations, and so you get your ecosystems that story.
Now, the exact amount of how you get from a certain incredible of CO2 to what temperature, and where the positive back is going to go back to what the positive back is only uncertainty, but not very much.
And there's certainty about how the consequences will be, but they'll be very serious.
I often asked this top scientists.
should we really come out, need zero?
Can we don't neces?
And the answer is that, until we get in the neighborhood, the temperature.
And so that's a big challenge.
It's very differently, very differently than a four feet truck under a 3.6 feet foot of 3.6 feet that we can try to get it.
This is something that has to do this.
Now, we pick up a lot of CO26 billion ton.
For each American is about 20 ton.
For people in poor countries is less than one ton.
It's a average of about five ton for everybody on the planet.
And we had to do it, anyway, things to change that zero.
It's constantly.
Only a little bit of economic changes, so we need to get from a fast, so we have to go from a name, and from a named completely to zero.
This equation has four factors.
A little bit multiply.
So, you've got something on the left side, CO2, which is that you want to bring now, and that is based on the number of people, the average use of services per person, the average use of energy for every service, and the CO2 emissions per energy for every service,
So, let's look at this agree piece of piece of piece and see how we can get this.
Probably has to be one of these values in zero.
That's resource school mathematics school, but let's take a view.
First we have the population.
Now, the world has today 6.8 billion people.
That's rising about nine billion.
So, if we really do it with new vaccines, health care, health care, reproductive health care, reproductive health care about 10 or 15 percent, but we've seen 10 or 15 percent, but we're seeing a rise of about 1.3.
The second factor is the services we use.
This view everything, the food that we eat, clothing, clothing, warming.
These are very good things, and the roads, and the road of poverty means to almost everyone on the planet.
So it's great as this number as this number.
Well, in the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably probably concerned and business, but in a correctly, but in this tal, average, in totally average, the services will be double more than double per person more than double.
Here we have a very simple service.
Have your light in your house to read your house to read your house, so they're going to go outside and read their homework under the countries.
So, efficient E, the energy for every service.
We've got good news.
We don't have a little bit does.
Via diverse invention, and new ways of enlight, by resource of other kinds of cars,
There are a lot of services where you need the energy that is necessary.
Some individual services, even 90 percent.
There are other services like how we produce or how we produce or how we produce the space, where the space is much smaller.
And so, if we are optimistic, we can have a factor three to self, maybe a factor, a factor.
But before this first three factors are 26 billion best, 13 billion and that is just not enough.
So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a defined -- and that's the CO2 emissions per energy.
So the question is, can you get that right?
If you tools, no.
If you gas you're stood, no.
Because every way we are produce today, electricity produce today, except the emerging sustainable energy and nuclear energy and nuclear energy and nuclear energy, CO2.
And so what we need to do, is a new system is a new system.
So we need power.
So, if I use, when I use the term use the term I not use on something that is impossible.
The microprocessor is a wonder. The pric is a wonder.
The Internet and his services are a wonder.
So, the people have contributed here.
Normaliter, we don't have a deadline, when you have to have the live on a certain date.
Now, usually, you just wait and sometimes happens, sometimes not.
This is a cause, where we actually need to be full speed in full speed within a wonderful agenda.
Now I thought, how can I actually do this this?
Is there a kind of natural illustration, a demonstration, which is a demonstration?
I thought I was thinking about a year ago when I mosed mosquito figure out that whether was fun.
It actually made them involved in the idea that people are living.
So, with energy, this was the only thing I could think.
I decided to fireflies like my contribute to the environmental here.
So here we have some natural fireflies of down.
My is told that they're not going to be strong, they may not even this pot.
So, there are all kinds of gimmick solutions like this, but they're not really.
We need solutions to be a incredible incredible scale, and of an incredible scale, although people in many directions, even though people in many directions, I actually search a beautiful contributions.
That least let me square geothermic energy, othermic energy fusion fuels out.
Those maybe able to better and if they do it better than I expect it better than I expected better, but my main this is that we need to work on each of these five and we can't work on each of these five and we can't work on their own importants.
Let's first look at fossil fuels looking at fossil fuel, burning burning of course gas.
What you need to do that, maybe simple, but it's not.
You have to put all the CO2 after the burning, under pressure, under pressure and close it down.
Now there are a number of projects that are about 60 to 80 percent to 80 percent to 80 percent to 10 percent to 10 percent and determine that we need to close CO2 is also difficult, but the difficult of this is the long-term problem.
Who will do this sure you?
Who will be garant to be garant for something that literally bigger than any kinds of malso much of you can think in terms of nuclear or other things?
This is a huge volume.
So that's hard.
The next is nuclear energy.
Also, three great problems.
The cost, cost, with regulated countries, are high.
The question of security, really, really, that nothing can do, that nothing can do, you have this human operators can't be used for nuclear weapons.
And what do you do?
And, even though it's not so much worried.
There must have a good feeling about it.
So three very difficult problems that maybe worked solutely and worked to be worked before.
And the last three of the five, I grew peered.
These are what people often called the renewable sources.
And though the amazing is that they have no fuel requires --
One is that the density of the energy of energy won through these technologies are lower than the electral.
This is energy energy, you have a lot of square miles, thousands of miles, thousands than you need for a normal energy centraal.
There are intermittering sources.
The sun doesn't shines the whole day, and not every day, and it doesn't always any day, it doesn't alway.
And so, if you're dependent on these sources, you have to find a way of energy during energy that they're not available.
So, we have great cost-challenges here.
We have transport.
Now, imagine that these energy sources outside of country, you don't need the technology, but you don't need the technology, but you have to have the risk of the energy comes from the energy comes from else.
And, finally, it allowed problem.
And to make that visible that visible all kinds of batteries that are made being made being made before computers, for telephones, for the clamps, for all kinds of electric energy that uses the world, and what I found the world, and what I found is that all the batteries we may make less than 10 minutes of all the battery.
So we need a big breakthrough here, something that is a factor hundred better than the approach we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not easy.
This is important if you try to get that unreliable to get that unrely higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you use.
If you take for 10 percent on a 10 percent on a wonderful battery.
Now, how are we going to advance: what is the right approach?
Is it a Manhattan-project project?
Well, we need a lot of companies that work on it.
In each of these five, at least hundred people.
And a lot of them, you'll find a lot of this.
And, I think here in the TEDgroup, we have a lot of people who are already.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a called eSolar that great thermic solar technologies.
Vinod Khosla investing in dozens of companies, Degreat things and interesting and interesting possibilities, and I try to support it.
Nathan Myhrvold and I support a company that, perhaps surprising, nuclear energy.
There are a number of innovations in nuclear energy, and fluence.
And there's a very long time, innovation in this industry, so it's not so strange that there are good new ideas are good new ideas.
The idea of Terrawer is that, instead of using only a small part of uranium to use anium.
a little bit weird idea."
One has ever been thinking about thought, but they could never be a good simulate or it would work.
But through the next of supercomputers can do that, and you!
With the right materials will probably work.
And because you use the 99999, the costs enormous.
You even use the currently, and as a fuel, you can use the basical reactors.
So instead of cause, that new fuel, that new fuel, that's great!
It uses this uranium in the reaction. It looks like a reaction.
You can see in this animation, often become a continue of continue.
For the fuel, is this really done solution.
I have a photograph of a place in Kentucky.
This is nuclear, the 99 percent, where the 10 percent of where the 10 percent of the 10 percent of them.
So it's called uranium.
That's enough for hundreds of years.
And through a cheap way to filter, you get enough to filter fuel, you get enough the life of life of the entire planet.
So, there are a lot of challenges for the future, but it's an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go.
So let's think, how do we measure ourselves?
How do we see?
Let's first see where we need to get out, and then we have to look at the between way.
For 2050, speak a lot about 80 percent reduction.
And that it's really important to get that.
And that 20 percent will be used by poor countries, a part of agriculture.
Hopefully we have clean cement.
So, to take those 80 percent countries, the developed countries as China, their electricity production completely.
And the other again, Passes we continue technology in all the developed countries, and are we concerned that else else that else else?
That's super important.
That is a very important measure.
So, how to do it report for 2020.
Well, it should be able to those two off.
We need to improve that efficiency improvements.
How less we pick up the CO2 becomes the CO2 becomes the temperature.
But in some ways, the momate that we except by doing things that doesn't take us to the great big, or maybe even less than the other, or maybe even less than the others, or maybe even less than the other, that's the piece of innovation.
These breaking through we need to full speed in terms of companies, and we can measure in terms of business, regular things that changed.
Here's a big number of beautiful books.
The book of Al Gore, "Al Gore, "Al Gore, and the book of David McKay book, "Duurzle Energie Sunder the hear."
They really, it really good and put a fellow that this can be in big lines, because we need to have a broad of broad here.
There's a lot of that together.
So this is a wish.
It's a very concrete wishing that technology.
If you gave me one wish for the next 50 years, I could choose president who president president, I could choose a vaccine, or I could do a vaccine, or I could pick up with half of the costs, without CO2 emission of the cost I could choose with the wish.
This is the one with the biggest impact.
If we don't get this wish, the separation between the people who think on the short term and long term will be horrible term between poor and China, between poor and China, between poor and rich countries, and particular life will be much worse.
So, what do we have to do?
What do I ask you?
We need to get more fundance of research.
If countries in places like Kopenhag, they don't just talk about the CO2.
They need to have this innovation agenda discuss, and you'll figure out of these innovative approach to these innovative approaches.
We need market prikets market purch, CO2 taxes and accountable.
We need to put the message.
This dialogue has to be more rational and understanding and understanding the government.
This is an important wish, but I think we can achieve it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Now, I understand more about Terrapower, OK. I mean, the first picture, the first place of the investment?
Bill Gates: Bill Gates: Bill the supercomputer, the supercomputer, all the great scientists, what we have, which is just dozens of millions of millions of millions, and even thought our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials in a Russian reactor to be in the hundreds of millions.
The tricky is the building of the experimental reactor, finding the couple billion, the finding of the regulator, the location of the regulator.
Once you have built the first one, as this works like this works like this, it's just clear, because the economy, because the economy, the energy density, the energy density as we know.
CA: And yeah, to understand the well, it's about building deep under the ground nearly as a kind of vertical colum fuel, from this kind of connecessary fuel, from this kind of connection, and then it starts to the upper and works on the upper and works on the upping and works down down?
BG: That true today has to be the reactor, so you have a lot of people and so you have a lot of people and a lot of the controlle, that thing you have to open and do.
That's not good.
So, if you have a very cheap fuel, you have a very cheap fuel, you can put 60 years, but on it as a background-ground process -- picture.
And it's just down, and it just says, and then it says, and then it's done.
CA: It's a nuclear central, which are own.
BG: Well, what happens to the fall, you can actually sit -- you can sit -- there's a lot less away, with this approach -- or you can actually put it down again, and it in another and burn it there.
And we start with the falling on the corporate that today, that is in the reactor, that is in the reactor, or is cleaning in reactor is cleaning in reactor is cleaning in the reactor of the reactor of the reactor of the reactor, which is in the reactor, which is in the reactor.
That is our fuel.
So, what was a problem from these reactors of reactors is actually what is invented in the unus, and you reduce the volume of the display dramatically through this process.
CA: But in your global conversation about these possibilities, where most interesting thing to do?
BG: Well, we don't have certain place certain place, and there are interesting opens everywhere.
I've met the state secretary of energy here, to talk about how this fits in the energy agenda.
So I'm optimistic. You know that the French and the Japanners and Japanese what work.
This is a variant on on something that is.
It's a very important step forward, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have done a fast reactor has done a quick reactor, is a potential candidate to build the first one.
CA: So, in your mind, in your minds, and probability and probability of something like this?
BG: Well, we need for such electricity in such electricity in big scale things that are very cheap, we need 20 years, and then we need 20 years to implement.
That is a kind of term that is the environmental models using us.
And, you know, Terrapower, as everything good, what a lot of people wish, which would be easy.
And there are now happy dozens now companies, we need hundred hundred hundreds of their research good, if the financing for their subjects.
And it's the best thing if there are multiple class, because you can use of a mix of these things.
We need at least one need to beat.
CA: In terms of possible changes on big scale, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy breakthrough it's very important.
That would be, even without the environmental limitation, but the environmental constrained so much bigger.
In the nuclear sector are also other other increases.
You know, we don't know their work as good as well, but the modular people, that's a different approach.
There's a type liquid reactor, which seem to be a little bit hard, but maybe saying that about us.
So there are differently, but the beauty of this is an uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as buried a carbon molecule, and if you can start with the negative effects, which are in being the negative effects, in terms of effects, in terms of effect, in terms of effect on the country and different thing.
CA: If this isn't work, what do do?
Do we start with the traffing necessing necessarily to try to keep the temperature.
BG: If you're in that situation, it's like you have overweight and get on the point to get a heart attack.
Where are you going to have a heartoperation or such a heart operation.
There's a line of research engineering geoengineering, that are different techniques that would be a different techniques that we could get us 20 or 30 years to get our solution.
That's just a kind of coration.
You don't need that you don't need it.
Some people say that you don't even have to work about such a such of such because it may be a lightoperation because you know that there's a heart operation to save you that there's a heartoperation to save you.
I don't know whether that is the importance of the problem of the problem, but there's now the geo-engineering discussion of the back point to the back in the back point, or if the innovation is going to be a piece of slower than we expect.
CA: CA: Klimate skeptics, if you could say a or two sentences of them, how would you convince them wrong?
BG: Well, unfortunately coming out of different camps.
There are very few with scientific arguments.
Do they have a negative feedback of the negative feedback to the clouds that compens?
There are very, very, very few things that they can still better of one in a million a million a million a million a million that they can get up.
The most important problem we've got here is like an AIDS.
You make the wrong now, and you pay much later.
And yeah, when you have all kinds of problems, the idea behind behind the pain to get later the advantage -- and a result.
In fact, the IPCari-rapport didn't necessary the worst scenario, and people in the rich worst scenario, and people in the rich world of the IPCC and says, OK, that falls down.
It should be uncertainty that uncertainty.
But my dream is that, if you can make the economically, one late to the CO2 constraints, accepticians say, "OK, it can't be shopping CO2 comes out of CO2 comes out of CO2 from comes from come, but I'll be accepting it out of CO2 from comes because the cheaper.
CA: And that would be your reaction on the argument of Bjorn Lomborg, which actually basically if you take all this energy of the CO2 problem is going to solve the CO2 problem.
It's a fix of aid resources to spilling money to spend money and better things that we can do.
BG: Well, the real excited for that R&amp;D part -- say, that the U.S. should spend 10 billion more than now than now -- is not that dramatical.
It doesn't have to be away to other things.
It's really walking in great contributed in big this, and can reasonable people of different people of difference, when you do something that uneconomically is trying to funding.
That is, usually, usually, usually,
And unless you're very close to a solution and you're just the learning course, and then it becomes very cheap.
I think we have to try to try to try to be much less the potential to be much less expensive.
If the course of the energy that you start, let's super energy super expensive that affor.
I mean, we're all going to be here for our energy for our energy for our energy without our lifestyle.
The disaster is for that two billion.
And even Lomborg is changed.
His creating now, why is not about R&amp;D so.
He's still before because of his earlier speaks, associated with the eptical camp, but he realized that a pretty camp, and he's a free camp -- and he has now the Red point.
And so there is a red rod that I think of important.
It has been crazy.
CA: Now Bill, I suspect I suspect that most people here when I say, that I really hope that I hope your wish. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
BG: Thank you.
Grain part of you what I discovered a few months ago when I discovered an article for the italian Wired.
I always like I writing the hand when I writing the hand when I writing the piece of the piece of the piece, and I thought I've never been looking at the word.
I read you the text.
"Inval," saying, "Cuple, dropples, failes, failes, failes, failes, failed, failed, lam, failed, flost, reduced, basically, basically, basically, basically, basically, basically dance, basically, dance, basically, basically, basically, dance and wed.
Antonies: healthy, capable."
I read this for a friend's friends, because it was so ridiculous, but after "mangeld" started to broad," started to breaking again, and I had to stop down again, and I had to stop it from the emotional shock these words.
Good, of course, this is my good, of course.
I think this is an old pressure.
But it was a pressure out of the early 1980s, when I started developing about the lower school, and started to develop a picture of myself outside myself, and the other kids and the world to the other kids and the world.
I don't need to say that I didn't need to be a thesaurus.
With this description looks like I was born in a world where somebody when I was considered to say where somebody nothing positives that nothing positived to say while I was celebrating the possibilities I've been celebrating up in my life.
So I went to the 2009 online for the 2009 online edition, and expected a whole revision.
This is the before worked version of the text.
Unfortunately better.
I find particularly the last words underneath "Dig antony."
It's not just about words.
It's about our opinion about people when we put them with these words.
The values behind the words, and how we construction.
Our language influence us think, and how we see the world and see how we look at other people.
A lot of ancient societies that the Greeks and the Romeins believed that the speak of a liquid so powerful, because if you say a little hardo, because if you say something he's being truth.
So what do we want to reality to reality for reality, a person who are limited or a person that powerful?
If we do something simply simple when the qualify of a person, a child, then we work and work a shadow about their force.
Don't we won't love to them?
Somebody who opened up to me was my doctor, when I was child, at A.I. Dute Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
He's called Dr. Pizzutillo.
Italian American Americans, whose name out of speaking, so he called Dr. P.
Dr. P. Peard always very color, and had exactly the good institution to work with kids.
I mean everything in the time I was in the time I was in that sould, with exception of the physiotherapy sessions.
I had to do a almost intelable number number of repeating of those diseastic -- different colors -- to build my bone muscle.
I hate that elastics are more than everything.
I hate them, I gave them names. I hate them.
If fived child negotiated with Dr. P. P. P. P, to get under the result of it, without result of course.
On a day, he came within with a session -- exhaustomed and genaishments -- and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a powerful girl, you are such a powerful girl girl, I think elastic.
If you give you a hundred dollars."
Of course, this was a tactic set of Dr. to do the exercise that I didn't want to do with anything that I didn't want to do with the richest five-year-old girl, but what he actually actually did was a nare, but what he actually did was that he did a nare,
Today I wonder to ask me in the future, and his vision that I was a strong girl and powerful girl, my self-order girl and a powerfuture.
This is an example of how adults in power power, the power of a child.
But in the previous situations of those thesaure text represents our language to the reality that we all like to reality that we would like to reality to see itself: the possibility for the individual to see itself capable.
Our language the changes in society not, and a lot of that, and a lot of that.
With of medical point, from medical point, my legs, laser treatments for bad to bad engths, titanium and home for ancient lights for old bodies more with their nature opportunities to go across their nature accounts, to social network about social network about social networks, so that they can describe, so that they can describe so that they can describe so that they can dedicate they're may be able to do great.
So perhaps technology shows us a much more always a truth that everybody has been a truth extraordinary and powerful that has been powerful and powerful our best property.
And the ability of human beings are interesting, because everybody wants to constant, because everybody wants to talk about windown, and I'm going to know something.
That sense of me never explain, and it felt uncomfortable to answer the questions of people answer to answer why.
The frase "the overwin of course, the frase that successes that success or happiness is that successes after a challenge experience.
But in reality we changed. Of course, we have drawed by a challenge, or it's physically, or both own.
And my imagine is a good thing.
Today is not an obstacle that we need to live.
It's a part of our life.
I think the tendence.
Sometimes I see a lot of them, but it's always to me.
I'm not going to certainly the impact and the importance of somebody,
There's a and challenge and challenge in life, and it's all real and before everybody else, but the question is not going to have to contract with opposition is going to reach them.
So our narrow responsibility is not simply to protect to protect together, but they're good to reach right.
We don't prove our children not a service if we do they're not going to be able to applied.
There's a very important difference between the objective fact that I'm an objective society and the subjective society of whether I am or not invalence.
Anyway, the only real handicap I constantly, the world was always the world that was always definitions.
In our narrative to protect our narrative facts of their medical facts of their medical profound, or even a profoundation, or even a tractive quality of life, we need to make sure that we're not the first stone of the incredible that we don't really invalue.
Maybe making the current way of looking at what is looking at you and how to repath, and how we need to repathing, somebody than the pathology self.
Because not to go from the universe of a person, by not recognize their strong, we create a new disease, we may have a new disease, that may have a new disease.
In fact, in fact, we added somebody else value for our society.
So we need to look at the pathology to look at the scala of human power.
And the most important thing is that there is a collaboration between that visible tections and our best creative power.
It's not to device those difficult times or exploring as what we want to me, or underneath the floor, but to get instead of flowing that possibilities in the opportunity.
So maybe the idea that I want to bring up to the point that you shouldn't have to win, but you need to core, but you have to put it up to the correctly, but you have to be able to use a better, maybe even through dance.
If we look at as natural as a natural consistent and useful us feel less obviously.
This year we course the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin, and when he was 150 years ago.
I mean, it's not the strongest species that survival, is the most intelligent, but the type of change, but the kind of change.
Conflict is the genesis of creation.
Well, at the other of Darwin's work we can make the human beings are driven and suddenly driven by the mental increase through mental conflicts to transformation.
Again, again, transformation, that is our biggest power.
until we don't know what we can't do about what we can't do about what we can.
Well is that the opposition is oblight us, self, a consciousness of our own force.
So we have to give ourselves a gift.
We can imagine again, we can imagine as a monly difficult time.
Maybe we can see it as change.
Today is change that we haven't concerned us.
And I think the most important thing that we've spent ourselves that we've given the understanding of normality.
Who is normal?
There's no normal.
There's a normal. There is a normal.
And who should be doing around, grauate person like to me?
I didn't think about it.
If we can take the paradigm of strives to normalities, or potentially dangerous, or potentially dangerous, then we can get the power of many more kids and valuable, and valuability and valuability to share the community.
Anthropologists are telling us that the only we need people always need to be useful of our groups are useful of our group,
There are pointed 60,000 years ago, they were 60,000 years ago, their parents and crazy includes because the life of various experience and survivalization and survive these people of value for the community of value to be as a broken and us.
A few years ago, I was at the market in the village that I grew up in that red piece in that red piece in the north piece of a trol tomates.
It was summer. I had a short briefly.
I heard a man behind me say, "If that Aimee Mullins.
And I turned around, it was an older guy. No idea who he was.
I said, "Pardon, do we know each other? I can't remem."
He said, "It's good possible you don't know each other.
When we met each other, I put you out of your mother's mother."
Oh, that down.
And of course when it quarter.
This guy was doctor Kean, a guy I just knew stories of my mother's stories from that day, because I came up with naturally two weeks weeks for my own birthday.
My mother's prenatal doctability was already to me, so the guy who was a strange for my parents.
And because I was born without the displengthed foots, and a few tends to the other, and a few tends to the other foot news to the bad news.
He said to me, "I had to be your parents of the property that you might have never been to walk, and never the movement freedom that different kids and totally no independent life, and not independent that moment of me.
The extraordinary is that he told he's newspapers has collected my childhood for my childhood won in the second classroom in the second classroom in the second classrooming Hallow, or one of my sports win, or one of my sportive overwinning, and he used to use its students, and he used it, integrated in his teaching students at the Hah.
Of course, he called the x-factor, the potential of human will.
No proportion can predict how powerful this can be as a particular factor for the quality of the quality of everybody.
Doctor Kean, he said, "I experience, if it doesn't reach constantly constrained to support, and even with only constraintion, a child out of itself."
See, Kean had changed.
He understood that there is difference between the medical condition and what somebody could do with it.
And in the course of time, my thinking has changed, if you had asked me as a 15-year-old whether I had asked my artiful.
Because I wonder to such a normality.
If you ask me now.
That is because of the experiences I had, not despite the experiences that had it.
Maybe this is changed in me, because I've been exposed to people who have been opened for me than the ones that have opened me and shadown.
Look, you need only humans you need the public shows you the public power.
If you can give somebody the key to its own force, the human spirit is so basically, if you can open that and on a essential moment a door.
You learn them doors.
The exact meaning of the word "education."
That means that what is inside of the inside of the inside, potential outside.
So again, again, what do we want to bring outside?
There was a case-study in the 1960s in England, where they went from gymnasia to schools communities.
It was called "streaming. In the United States we call the "next.
They distributed in 10, 9, 8, 7, and so forth.
The 10-students are getting a difficult packs, the best teachers, etc.
During a period period of three months they gave 10, and told they were dozens 10, and told they were intelligent.
On the end of three months they prested on 10-level.
The heart simply simply size of this students that they were the 10-students that they were told "four.
And that also happened after three months.
One of the ones that were in school, next to the people who had hat.
One critical part of this research was that the teachers before the teachers.
The teachers didn't know the teachers didn't know.
There was told this: these are the students with this.
And so they went down, and so treated them.
I think the only real highly real hunning a spirit of course, a spirit has no hope.
He's no beauty.
He has our natural curiosity, children's curiosity, no longer imagination.
If we can hope the spirit of the spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in itself, and to see others to be fantasy and fantasy and fantasy and fantasy before, we actually use our power of good.
If a spirit qualities, then we're able to create new realities to create new realities, new ways of being new ways to be.
I want to close with a poem through a resource century close Persian poets of my friend Jacques Dembbois told.
The poem is called "The God those words know."
"Each child not the God, not the God, not the God, not the God, but the God that was only four words, but the God that he repeat, saying, "Dance dance dance with me.
Thank you.
