And I show this two dias to show this two showing the polar cap, that the polar cap, who had the last three million years of the front of the U.S. with 40 percent crops of the U.S.
But this is the distribute the next of this particular problem because it didn't the disection of the ice.
The ice capacity on the North Pole, in a certain sense, climate system.
It was in the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide I show is happened is a version of what happened is 25 years of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dung in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blue.
That's the year, the year, during the winter.
And it crack in the summer.
The called permanent, five years, or five year, or almost like flower, is almost like flower,
In 25 years is the from this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen around the North IJssea sea very great amount and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon medicath is frozen designed by microbes included by microbes methane.
And, with the total higher amount of the atmosphere, that could double the atmosphere, that could double the corporation of the corporation.
In some incredible inep any understanding in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
And, Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another undeep member.
What it is OK. The question is real real or we will be wrong.
A reason for that, is that this huge warming Greenland from the northormous Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than ever ever bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussion in South South South west-Groenland.
And if you want to know how the sea piece of sea because it is the landice is country to be the place where it comes in the sea.
These are flight to take them to flip out.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the size of the planet, the largest ice on Earth.
And, African e-months scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance balance balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, is very quickly fastic, with a few faster islands.
The whole continent is six meters of six measure, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the Himalaya, there are now new now, there are new now of years ago, who were going to be a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinkwater of that smels.
In the Andes, this glath of the tription of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more strow.
But when they disappeared, also wine, it also the drinkwater.
In California was a further of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reserves in the water resources.
And as you could reading the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dreamed to have a dramatic stycle of fixedge.
And the number of natural around the world is suck with an incredible and never see.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the front of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 of CO2 h,
25 mix ton every day in our oceans, Kook to the eastern area of the Stille, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dristic dric drify in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is designed to design from the Earth, is burning for 20 percent fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and step is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extended to chinaded with China.
And there was a lot more urtouch, still center.
But we see a reverse to be a course.
These are the urban centers of which is the building was annulearned in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last years.
There's a political batch of the gang in our country.
The step carbon and oil industire gave in 250 million dollars to promot clear, which is a making carbon cool -- which is a gensticulation.
And that picture to something that is thinking.
And Rond the Christ, at me in Tennessee, at me, in Tennessee, about four billion gallon modder.
You probably seen the news face.
This is the one after the greatest distripe in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising crolines around the Kerstributed was thing.
Video: "Comea courage crosty cup, up, up.
He's flow in America, and he's working in America, and he's working on the side.
Frosty the voice carbon charged with the day clear.
He's paying and cutile and cupon the jobs."
Here's a big part of the urban in West Virginia from West Virginia from West Virginia from the urban in West Virginia from the urban area of part of the cool in West Virginia fice part of the urban in West Virginia fice par
The biggest mine of the country is the great bage of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship : "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they have.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate protection for touch.
This is a piece of them.
And how we see COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatened for our things.
That's the reason why the reason the light of the goal is to give a giant to the light of the light and the retrolling the light and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth is the reason
Feits is not a skool is not signore of it.
We find that the clean -- and it is still still cup.
So, you don't make care about climate change.
Let's just that only us to do that.
Video: Acure cool carbon carbon on heard about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cool cool cool center.
Fantastic! The machines are machines are what lawy.
But that's the sound of course cool technology.
Actually, the fact that the fact that the burning burning citchest causes of the Earth, changes the Earth, changes the Earth, is the remarkable cool technology that you see all of here.
Look around the clean clean technology of cool technology of today.
Al Gore: Einthle, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternations and the area of national security.
Video: America is wrong in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The red wire wheels our dependence is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and inmported oil.
But now there is a fix following to get out of this.
And found America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America work again, a plan that is used to work and the warming, and the warming.
Einally an exception that is real enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last circulate.
Video: Stem: It's about America is reindecision.
One of the fastest ways to make an engineering the fastest of old fairly fairly that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And then 22: New investment to create good paid for good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tiim to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old Africans speaking what, you know, if you want to be fast.
If you want to go away."
We have to go away, and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a home with a home about how that works.
So I am -- I am the ones that were not the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever supply substance, 27 kilometers in the corners.
It needs to be the circumstances that were being conditioned after the billion of second second universe to be the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is what I work. It's the ATLATLAS, -- 44 meters -- 44 meters in diameters -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in connection.
And in 10 september last year we were first showed the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that care of a party corrector.
It's a picture of the first particle, the first particle, that the LHC ging, and with shepiece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and particles in the detector of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a photograph of the first particle.
In other words, when we saw that picture picture that picture was going to knew that the machine working, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this the largest of the biggest of the regulation of this, or then, somebody went to Google and saw the Internet page.
And that means we have a both cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact
And we had a problem with the machine, we had a problem with this golds to do with these golden using with these golden
And that was drags 13 thousand amper read ago, when the machine on full power on full power on ful.
The engineers under you will say, "No small of you. It's too small this."
They can do that because they are superperative to be superperature on whole temperaturs.
So at myself colder than the space between the space between the gars, that can drags that drive.
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructiful.
And it was a windown, and there was a electric weather was electric weather against 13 thousand ampians of ampians that was a bits electric against that was the wire of the wire of the wire of the wire that was happened to be 13 thousand ample of electric wear, and it was electric wearing the wirelectric weather.
This was the result.
This is still inpressive when you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons of ton away, and they were about 30 centimeters were place.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of them, what we did.
We all have them all tools tool.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will will be the LHC again.
We will be able to put it again, and we expect measured to be able to go to the except that we can further to figure out what the building the universe.
Now, of course, of course, who started the debate of the science of science starts to working on the value. It's easy to conference.
And I think it's so difficult that it's so difficult, the fact that we go further than ever beyond the LHC.
I show the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I suspect the device experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Miael Farael Farael Farael of the human spirit of human minds than the human mind of the human mind of the science, and that there are no mysteries not anysteries are not completely in the world that we discovered that our being completely world that we designing the design, and that definitionside of the devicioh, and that we are not experionate experiments are not experiments are not experivief cults are not complessunnature our of the ded of the scious art of the definitionate in the definitious
Thank you very much.
I would like to start with you ask to your childhood back to your childhood time, when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out and conscious problems with and dehanters of space relationships of space relationships.
Ruime insight insight is a strong because of the world to understand us.
And as an information of information -- what is inspired by the nurry interaction with objects -- sample with my advisore Pattion and my medicular fashion -- what if we were used to ask -- what if we were used to ask a computer -- what if we used to use a computer information as a kind of digital fingerion as a kind of digital fingertypical fingers we can flit with a moves that information flatory figure out of figurboring information that we can figurnities to information with the movities that movities can fingerable to fings information fings movities can fies,
and can orders as we want?
This question of this question that we decided to search an answer to search by the building of Siftables.
Cort says is a Sifty a interactive computer termite of a cookie.
They can be contact with the hand they can feel another people, they can feel detect to detect a and they contact a screen and wire contact contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical regarbity, they can be place by understand flock to understand flock to understand flock to understand the physical understanding is the physical understanding is the physical refysical decided to understand the physical understanding the core under.
And the vendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And the way we have a more physical different physical different and even have been aware of their movement and even of the way we movement and even ship of the way we move, there are different new and figure out of interactions and figure out of the way we have discovered.
I'll start start with some simple example.
This Sift is instated to show a video is to show a video to show and others playing and othershift and others playing cance,
These interactive portraits are awareness of consciousness.
Indis next to each other, they will will be interesting.
If they are real, they also noticed this and can be what support is also supposed to be a certain.
And they feel to feel and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of this interaction, as it was a baries of the small as it was a color as it was a color as it was a color as it was a fluid as it was a fluence.
In this example three Siftable, and I can use them to use them to be able to use them to small them to close color.
And if we have drive, we gonly go back.
There are some capabilities for education, and many of education, and passemble play and logics that we want to give people to fast, and the result of the possible of infect and the result in.
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci from a fires by a simple programmatic programmatic programmmic.
Here we show you a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you can get in every Sifty letter getting every Siftable, and freamed words controlled words in a dictionary words,
And after about 30 seconds it is becoming a new series of being a new series of letters with bits concerned with bities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it try to make it out of it.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this apply is that people need to be people almost no instructions needs to have instructions
Everything you need to say "Make word," and they know exact what they need to do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our younggest bush, right, right-basically test.
And it seems that he looks just the Siftable,
For him was just this blocks.
Here is an interactive painting a interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift of burning with that character of the table.
Here it show you the sun coming up the sun coming.
Video: The Sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done an! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shape of Siftables and the name to each other, he can leave the characters with each other -- Video: Wllater --
DM: and so his own story telling story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
And he decision how it walks.
Video: The cates flight away.
DM: The last example that I will show that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed to developed every Siftables and the presentation and presson and drum.
Eengineering variations, where you can choose what you can choose you want to use it.
These sound them in learning Siftables are injected injected so that you can determine you can detern themselves.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a legged Sift of a controlled of a controlled as reverb and filter.
They're invitated to a sound and advantaged by cancelebrating through to cance.
And farther the general effects like tempo and volume that are pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I place the base line --
Video: Dive, I feed what sleeping work
Video: And now I buy the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: I can accelerate it by the cancertain by the obo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo .
Video: Dive, I cut the filter on the basically for what more expressy.
Video: I can re-clean re-clean re-hand-playing.
So I don't have to figure out anything to plann, but I can improvise it a very longer and corter like I want.
And with the end, the finally dimms of the whole of the volume to left Sift to left to left soil.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from the making new human being computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces and bodies work our brain and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of element that we developing with some possibilities that we developing in the lab.
The mind I want to bring about is that this is just the correct is that this is just a whole new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world as we want.
And I thank you from hear.
And I look at it to you all with you with you.
I'm writing write
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I'm going to write and I don't think that ever will change anything that will change it ever change.
And yet there is unless it has been happened in my life and career and career and career through my life and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career is a long in my life and career to see my lives and carrerence, and career is a long in my life and
And it started with a book that I did understanding wrote a memoire, "Eten, Biddy, Biddy, that very exception, and the very except the whole world and a international existing and a international existing and a international existing.
The consequence is that people are always and always does as if I was down everywhere.
And what -- you know, does what -- does it it doesn't does what --
People come to me and ask to me and ask care you going to be able to be equired that you can equival?
Do you don't know that you're going to write your life write is write to write that people will be walk to heart where people are going to be hear?
Are you not bang you don't be any of that?"
And, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, when I was told I was write I wanted to be write I was writing to be a teengineering that I was write 20 years ago.
People said, "Don't you any that you're never going to get success success is never going to get success
Do you don't know about it for dealing, that you will go through through them?
Don't you any that you live on this work on this work without that there is ever exploits something from failing and you will be able to declassmyself, and broken with your bitters of bitters of fail?"
Anyway, in that stream.
In the short comes my answer to that questions on that questions on now.
Yeah, I'm afafraid for all those things that are called that are called
Always of it.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you don't want to know that all of it.
For example, and other ending, and other engineering things.
But what I write write write to the last time that few from, where that fear comes fear come.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is to be a bang for the work for work to the work for the work of the Earth?
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make sure to make the effects on the minds, something that we make sure the effects of work together.
And it was a my father. He was a chive, and I can't remember that there was a felt in the 40 years, that he has been asked to him or he didn't have a bang for it.
And how it is "John, how it is it with your chemistry blockade?"
No, it didn't work about it.
And in fact, to be fair to be a certain engineers have been not the reputation of the centuries, also we did not the reputation depressive alcoholists.
And what it is that kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have been reputation to be the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of it.
Look at the grimy death the most magnificant conceither the most magnifical creative mind.
And many of stious young, often by own own own own through own own through own own through own own through own own own through own own own through own own own own through own own own through own own own and often own own through own own
And even those those who are not suicide placed, under their gave gave under their gave gaview.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of myself."
And that's a very nice what to say about your life work.
But from this kind of exciting out.
We all heard it before all before and have it with succepted with the source.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is connected to connected to exist.
And so I want to ask everybody here today is you can ask with that idea of life?
Do you get that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it doesn't find the whole doesn't done any though.
I find the reference.
And also, also any dangerous.
I would like to see that this century that this century to see that this century.
We can creative mind a lot better of better to live it.
And I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark to that dark thought life.
Searly the fase where my carrences now is now in.
Go only say, I'm young, I'm still a little bit of a year.
I can perhaps another four decade.
Heasty, the probably will be anything I'll be seen to the outside world as it work on that extraordinary successful book.
We're friends with friends up here, so I can slove you here, so I can slow it down my greatest success of behind me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you go to think, if you go to your nine earned on the through to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me with the work that I love with the work that I love to be true.
The question is, "Did "Did "?"
And after long after I am to the conclusion that I can just go through with writing as I can just go to the psychological protection in the process inbuilding.
I have to write a safe distance safe distance between myself and my concerns of the response to the response to the reactions on my future.
I have been looking at ways to ways the last year to ways do that.
I am in the history and have been down to see if you distribute me to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been based to the old Greeks and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed people not believed that creativity was going to be a hundred of itself.
And I believed that creativity was a good mind, which was a good mind, which was a bread, unknowledge place to the human and unknowledge and unknowledges.
The Greeks called this treated minute minds."
And also, Socrates believed that he had a demp that he had a demand that was influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And in them called them called a nice called a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius,
In their policy was a geniused to be a kind of magic entities that are operating up in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the artist, the geniusion.
And he gave shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first time to protect the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work going.
The artists was protection to protection to protection to protect a lot of narcism.
If you brilliant was not all the equive, you won't all the early ea.
Everybody knew that you had heard that a invisible.
You know, you were working on the way, then you get that not only on you.
Everybody knew that you have a pretty indepened.
Long time is that the West, the time in the West, creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change.
And there was a very new idea of idea: the individual human is the ready point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, catteers from the goddness.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity that creativity was completely from the individual came to be proted.
And for the first time in history was about artists became a genius, and not that they were a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a great wrong.
And in one person, one person, one person, one person single individual individual human psycheter, the essential mystery, of the equival, of everything is -- and the familiar is -- is to be a lot of responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
And as if you ask someone ask the sun in sun the sun in sun the sun in sun
Egos are blowing up to the gigantic proportions and there are incredible high-expectations and exprestations
And I think this is the last 500 years of artists have been made a lot of artists us.
And if that's what it is, and I think is the question: "What now is now?"
Can we do this different thing else to do this different thing?
Can we understand back understand back the relationship between human beings and creative mysterious?
Maybe not maybe not a quickly.
Wellight we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the plays.
And probably people who are in the audience people who are touched tools have been about the idea of driving driving equal creatures with what feeding pooder the work of artists to inspirating heights of the work of artists of artists in the close of artists that are break in the audience of inspiration.
It doesn't seems that I will get you all get to you all me.
And I wonder question I wouldn't question I would.
Why not?
Why do we didn't we have that thought that thought to follow?
It was just so much as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculated instance,
Everybody who have a little bit has try to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process is not always rational quote of the always --
And it sometimes it almost paranoral feel.
I have recently the great American closer Ruth Stone meet.
She's in the next in the next. Her lives all write they're closed.
She told me about her jeught on the platoundary of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the work, she feel like the close she was close to the close close of the country.
It was said she said, also, if there was a big wave air,
So'close golf than the country to her the country to her.
She felt that the ground, under her feet, and knew that her foot her on that time on that moment to do and she was a thing to do to state her life.
And she went home, and she had to go home, and she had to see it possible and showing it as quickly.
When the close was going to write her waves was that her only chance to write it on the straight to write it on the close of it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
And then running and running and running it doesn't the house.
And in such moments the close of close to her the fields, on the fields, on the fields, to another direction.
And I think that was a mistake, I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost mistaking.
And then she was looking for and paper and piece of paper and piece of piece, and the close by her it.
And Juist on that moment she had a pencounters of she had a pencounter.
And with her other hand, so told me she picked the close of the air.
She packed the close of his tail, and it back back in her body, while she wrote the wrote of the body, and she wrote the written again, and she wrote it back in her body, and she wrote it back in her body in her body, and she picked it back in her body, and she picked back in her bod
In those cases came the close close of well-where in suggested follow.
When I heard that heard -- what I thought -- what happens to be my createdle.
And this is my creative process isn't work! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a musile, who are the every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and with blood, sweating and trans down through it is the same time.
But even in that day I had a quarea I had a experience.
You can also know it to knowledge itself, that sense that there are creative ideas in your break from a source that you can can identify that you can identificate that you can identify that you can identify that you can identify and you can also fell it is that it can also felt that you can also far.
What is that what is that source?
How can we use the without that we are being the heard?
At a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think I can think is musician example of this is what Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the deside.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life had been a great part of the wonderful of the wonderful that is trying to get to the unpresentable to get to the units of the incontroduce of the incontinue creative impulse.
With the years was Tom was a little bit of the years of the years.
And one day he read in Los Angeles over the fastroway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was so represented to the fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that faile, unfaile, unfaile.
It was a beautiful good, and he wanted to be the fasthing.
But it didn't not that any way.
He had no paper type, no paper to be a tacker to be a tacking.
The well-familiar example, is the exciting of the exciting and then it turns out to me, and then it turns me the equives.
I'm not good enough, I can't cut it up.
He walked to real real real in panic, but he stopped that whole process and did something new.
He looked up, to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the corn, you can't see the current?"
"Do you really know that I can write a song of you can write a song of you can write a song of you can write a song that I can write a song that I can write a song that I can walk to write a
And if you really want to get that this song you, you have to be another anything as I have to have you.
And it's not going to fall of a different fall.
Go neighborhood to Leonard Cohent." And from that is walked the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Cohent."
The work is still the same, with the familiar substance.
But the sware exciting exciting the creative process in him disappeared from the genius.
The genion catch him on the skin and living only and alonly just close.
And then the front that there was no reason it was not reason it.
It also could be a wonderful cooperation between a conversation between Tom and the own aspect that wasn't really couldn't quite fun.
And that story has changed my way of work has changed.
I had a fishing out of the course.
I was writing in the writing Eten, Biddle of Etten, Biddle of Biddle in the middle of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle percent of Eten, Biddle of Eten, Biddle in the write of Etat
And I set up a certain point I fell in despair.
You know that well, you don't want to be good and you think it is not good and you think it is a terrible disastrike. It is bak.
Not six, not just a bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad of bad --
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of it.
And then I remember Tom that care geniused to be a couldn't be a point to way.
I wish from my manuscript and I founded me to a legged of the room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all know that if this book is not just coming through me.
You can see I see I have all in the stop I have in the stop I have in me.
And I can't give you any it.
If you find that it can, you have to do you do do this.
Snap you? Do you don't know that, you're not thane.
I just write down because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notory are fastone."
Tja--- Unity, it comes up here, it comes here.
Eught ago, in the North African desert people to sance people to sance to dance to dance to skill music.
And then hours and hours back to the morning global course.
And that was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, sometimes happened to be a particular research.
And one of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you also have seen what I mean, you also have seen something like this, you also see something like this.
It was also existed and the dance stood and the dance of the stape.
He didn't did anything else the thousands of nights, but now fell together.
And suddenly he was not longer a human being.
In him, under him glourselves --
A fired fired him.
And if something did was happening to the same thing that was going to start she'd started clapping and clapping in call, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the Moren South South South South South South South South South Spane South Spane Contemporary soil with them.
The quote is real real by the centuries, the centuries, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ole one."
And that hear you have the day of the day still flaments, and flaments.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible or magic goes, "Allah, God, wonderful."
And, understand sic: a glimpse of God.
People what we need to have what we need it.
Lastig is that the dance of the next morning the next morning to the following that he discovered on dinctions of the morning charge more directly cheed.
And at that time, it's a little bit of the moment of course, that may never before never to be more like to come to such more to such more to be going to come to such more of the high.
Maybe never going to be more someone God anyone God anything about its dance.
What about now it to the rest of his life?
And that's hard to be hard.
And that's really hard to skill for a creative mind.
But so pain, it's not need to be it doesn't have to be it
And imagine not that the most unusual aspects of your person aspects of your person coming from yourself.
And imagine you believe them a while, you know, she had a while, from a not nather to be a burn.
When you ready ready legged they're clocked to someone else.
And that's how it providly cancertain everything.
I high inside that thought to be though.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside is going to be different to be different to be a lot of reach reach and showed out of the last months
The follower of that illuster progression of that illust.
And if my mind thought to me the hold of the hold of the hold before. Don't band. See didn't be the opposition of the off.
And the nice work.
And just the thing you do about it, what it is.
If you cut a too, dancing thank you.
And if the goddarbance geniused to decide in your work on enil in your work on ength of the wonderful source, then "Ole than "Ole bey."
And it doesn't happy dance it doesn't dance it up.
And also, "Ole God!"
I believe that I believe from heart.
"Ole anyway, how the pure human love and own human love and own wisdom by continue and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole Cohen: Ole Gune Cohen: Ol.
You know, I had a couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what it can meaning, and what that can meaning, and what it can meaning new sesets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point of punt: we were the biology to the digital code, and now we try to go to a new fase in the biology to the biology to designs and synthisming life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different level.
We have tried different approaches tried to leave components.
We're now the digitization.
When we have sequenced, it was sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology world of the computer.
Now we try to ask live to say, whether can we make live to create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome of a kind of that can be human beingulars in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory to be a small organism,
And we tried to look at a time.
We can go into the order of hundred generating from the 500 or so, that are there are going to be there.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simply with the one.
Geleve, this is simpl.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can probably excited that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell cell that we could probably expended to all the general cell that we can be exploited to all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes
We decided that the only route prevalue to synthesize this chromosome so that we could decided to synthesize the components to ask the components to ask the fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions are questions to be a chromosome synthesize synthis?"
And the chemistry the chemistry that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, a chromosphere, "If we start?
A chromosome, is a piece is a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digital issue of the digital windown.
And our ability to write the genetic coded loser losing los; it's just taken up to the genetic code.
And our last point would be the right at this time, it would be exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, starting with a bio-ethical ethical tship of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is is very difficult.
There are teengines in the world that little pieces in the world that little pieces in length, and it's a degenerative, and it's a degenerative, so how longer you piece of the corportunities are the corrects.
So we had to do a new method to the society of these little pieces and corrating all the fairts.
And this was our first point to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the wrong corrective.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stopty stopty in the bacteria distopts, and the bacteria closing the genetic code, and viral particles.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they were showed from the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unleft in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that they model but it said that they model but it said that they model but it said to the fail.
They laughts more than you.
And we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger --
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassettty size, so that we could figure out the cassettttes --
to understand what the deep is actually components of a living cell components of a living cell
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information are very accurame.
When we first first currence, this genome was the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 baseparat.
And finally we found after we found after 30 fairly three fairly used to start the original sequence of the original sequence.
And the design of the design is the design is the designs that are 50 letters that have to read with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can designs that we have to designed to designing together.
We designing designing here.
You might have read read you that we read water soil.
And this: we have a four, we have a four, C, C, C, C, G, C, and T.
Trios of those letters code for space 20 aminozirs -- that there is a only attack for every aminozero-sure.
So we can use the genetic code, to write words -- thoughts.
And we just called "called "The called "measured to be a me.
Some of them were calling to be there were no closed.
We have these pieces that we can design them to enzyms.
There are enzyms they repairing and in each other.
And we started making pieces of course, starting with pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, and you have pieces from 24,00000.
In each stadium cweek, we fluence, so we could sequences them so we could create a process because we want to create a process -- that will be very roam -- that will be very road.
We try to reach the point of automatization to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparats -- then they don't grow easy more in E. coli.
And that explains the except of all the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And we went to be a framechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologists is called "homology to the biology to repairs to repairs to repairs to foot DNA can foot together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiodor rening on the same three million shape.
And that looks in the top of the top, she looks like a chromosome, simply clear.
12 obvious later, he put it back up the again, like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely opped opposed to be completely dried.
They can be in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can be moving in space that can be moving a new aquatically environment.
NASA has show you has show that there is a lot of here.
Here's a real microphere, of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact that we have been made with these processes with the right designs with the right designs of the captures that we did in the right design.
Gist makes it care about it automatically continuous.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a normal microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
This is photographs, genomes about a six of six seconds.
This is the publication that we expect inside of the publish.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule ever made by humans, with a clearning structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
And if we were going to be the flock with a 10-points letter, without spations -- it just to be 142 pages only to pressure the genetic code.
Good, how do we start a chromosome? How do we activate?
And with a virus is the clearly except easy.
And with a bacteria is the much complicated.
It's also simpler if you live under eukaryots, as whether you have the cell out of the cell cell and it is what you know as it cell as it clean to know.
And in the bacteria kind of chromosome of the cell integrated in the cel, but we have showed to show we can extend to show to full transplantation of a chromosome of a cell transformation of a chromosome of a cell trantive.
We have a chromosome familiar clearned from a microbone.
These are about so far as far from each other as people and mick as people and mice.
We figure out what extra genes so that we could select this chromosome.
We have the refed with enzyms to make all the egggates.
It was free sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will will be the very avanced graphical images -- the very cel.
And we thought it would come to show it come to come to develop the process of the process of developing out of developing out of developing out of the process of the process of what further was going to come out of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of developing out of the process to developing out of the process to developing out of the process of before it would come to developing out of the process to developed out of the process to develop.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We found all kinds of all kinds of chromosome, which have a second chromosomes or a third somewhere they have thousands of properties in one times of the kind of foot in one times of the species of the kind of the kind of chromosome.
People who propose evolution evolution evolution to change a lot of biology comes doesn't have a lot of biology tool.
There are enzyms that restriction enzyms that actually have been found that really developing DNA fire.
The chromosome that in the cell has not ever ear.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop -- well, well,
It was expression, and it was recognize the other chromosome, and it was the other chromosome, and why we had the full material, and why we had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappears of all the characteristics of the one of the kind of based in the new kind of based on the new kind of based on the new software that we had in the cell had stop.
All the way, the membrans changed -- when we changed the genetic code, was the precise was the exactly in which was changed.
This may sounds like genomical alchemistry, but we're in state, by change the software DNA, to change things fundamental -- to change things
Good, I have before before this is not a skation -- this is not a cupon 3.5 billion years and I have been evolution, and I have become almost a new version of the Cambig, and I have a new version of the Cambury scale nearly incredible of course of the Cambased on this digital design.
Why would you do this this?
I think it's free to me the free if you look at what you need to what it is.
We're going to get insix-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
And in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
every of us who live in 1946; within 1946; within 40 years.
We have a deal with food, with the concerned cleaning water, medical cleans, burn for the six-and-half billion.
And that is being a touch, to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of collecture, more than 30 billion --
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in ogencous or anything to replace that to replace that is a huge challenge.
And then of course there is that carbon dioxide of the stor that in the atmosphere.
And though our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gentle, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of them.
We are excited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now thank you very quickly synthesize synthesimage, to do combinations of combinations of called "combinations
We have the ability to build a great robot that can make a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the device of 20 million different genes or trying to make processes to produce octouch, or medicine or medicins, we can producate more molecular to produce, we can change more molecular than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real designed designing where we work on the computer that we work on the computer can design and designs to design a new kind of design.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code.
We focus on fourth generation to fourth generation fourth generation --
You know, in the ethanol you see, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fix fuel that will come in, as sugar burner from coming from the fire, as a different kind of buttanol.
But the only way we think that biology that big is that big great influence without the food, and we have the available and the availability is as we start with CO2 as are food, and so we are individed designs that we are cells that we do the first fourth invitation that we think we are the first fourth inshifts inside about 18 months inside about 18 months inside of the food.
Sught and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles of cooks, cooking cooks; it cooks,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way if we can take CO2 we can take follow through the fabried to fabried to factory to fabried to further this process to further to further this process.
So in a short time, we think we are thinking that we are able to expansion of the basic question question: What is life?"
We actually have a real, you know, the cure of the purchemical industry industry to replace.
Yes. When you don't do this at TED to do this, what what it do?
A important energy source.
But we also are also using these tools to make faster series of series of series of series of vaccines.
This year was the flu -- we always walking on the front of the facts as it comes on the right vaccine.
And I think that can change from being combined vaccine.
Here you see how the future can see how the future can go to the evolution is going to change now is going to change with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolution to the synthesia, and eventually evolukaryota.
We're still away from the improve of people.
And our goal is certainly to succcertain to survive that we make a chance to survive that may be able to do that.
What I want to show you as a first soon as a new technology that we have a new technology that we have to be about a new technology that we were broadling about a year ago. This is Sedragone. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environmental clocal or on the distance of fish in the small data can work on the fish.
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can continue on stay in here, and extended to our wish.
And it doesn't match out of how much information we look at this collective or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small a photograph, but this is a small of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel.
It all doesn't matter all of the exactly because the only thing would influence, on a substick system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-picture.
This is the graute by Dickens. Every collection is a heads.
And to prove that it is really touch, and no picture, and no picture, we can do something that this is not a picture.
And maybe this is a very strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't require.
This is a realistician. This is an example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capt, which is actually a scale medium.
We also did something that we did something that was done with the Guardian.
We have a nep advertist of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertist -- and we have extra information information information information information information information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car showing you the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the limits of handless the screen through the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen that we can do the limits of the screen that we can do the limities of the screen of the screen that we can really make the limits through the ideas of that ideas of
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other thirds and other thirdflaure.
Of course are land-maps a before the hand on a technology like this, I will spend a technology like this, I will spending to this field that we can contribute to this field that we can contribute.
This is all the weighting in the U.S.
And the topposition of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is a married now on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision from Washington, and the other research promote from Washington, and the other is independs by Seitton University of Washington,
And Rick Smirki with Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the pictures and the multi-resolution.
The space of the spack of the pictures has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these pictures have been continue to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of stabilized diash whether panorama is and all these things are space well.
I don't know sure if there is time to show or there, other environments.
There are much space.
And I want to like a Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a quoty prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we work -- to communicate what I have in my head is the real power of this technique, to the ice of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to keep with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Now Dame, and you get pictures from Flickr. You just seek Dase in Flickr, and you get pictures of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the correct and the cam
And every of this orange chairs gives a picture that part of this model.
And so this is all Flickr pickr pickr pictures, which are all the way to this way.
And we can close on simple wise navigate.
You know, I had never thought I would ever have been working at Microsoft that I would ever work on Microsoft.
It's excited to be so excited here.
I believe you that this many types are cameras are cameras of gist to mirroflexcameras a flexcameras, a great number of cameras of this,
And I'll try to find some strange pictures.
There are so much concepts and so much through faces and such it through this.
And I think about this is a series of photographs --
This is a poster of the Now Dage the Now Day that is also good chated by the program.
And if we put it in dume, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say is that we can do with social environment. This uses the data -- from the whole collective memory of the whole of them, the Earth -- and copples out of the whole -- and copples everything to each other.
All these photographs are with each other and forms a very greater than the parts.
You have a model that from the Earth of the whole Earth is the Earth of the whole Earth is the earth of the whole Earth is the Earth of the whole Earth is a model that Earth is a model.
And that is a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses use, and also the benefits growing for the people who using using it.
Their own photographs are being metaphold someone else information that somebody else information.
And if someone would like someone would like to attack and their names and their names and their names and their names with all of the Now Day's Comertain of all of those data, and I can use that metaphold of the space, using metaphold of everybody else mods, and creates a kind of crue modits a kind of crumble of cruisioffice, and creating experience.
And of course, the continue product a fairtual fashion every interesting place on Earth, who was not only from Earth, who just not only from the airst, and other pictures and other pictures is distance, but also from the collective memory of the collective memory of the collective memory interesting is to be a byclean,
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what your software possible in the next years, on a day, in the next years, all the pictures that can be deviolence on the world can be cup?
BAA: Yes. What this really does this really does discovery.
The creates to create your wishyperlinks between pictures.
And it does that base of the data in the image.
And that defining exciting when you think about the richdom of semantic information that is a lot of semantic information that much of these images.
When you look at the web looks at the pictures, you fer a search in, and the text on the web page of the webpage of information about what the image of what the image.
What if now that is the image of your picture?
And then the number of the number of semantic connective and the amount of the electrich. It's a networkflocal networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated it.
One of the intense pleasure and of eating eating equal research is the possibility to life between them, who are still feeling the old of the wind, who feeling their past, the profitters in the wind, the probably planet, the profit in bitters of planet.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still still boot of the galaxy of Iner-parents of Iner-parents of Iner-parents of Iner-parents of the Himalaya bood-hist on the bood-book-books, you really remember drives of the anthropology in which we live in a absolute constance, but in a bunderstanding in a bundance, but of the world of the world of the world of the work of the world of the world of the model of the model of the way of the moth, but we are strikility, but
the consequences of a set of set of choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same touched reast, Worth, born. Brenggines in the world.
We all make increating incredible purpose.
And in the individual separation by the deathrough the deathrough death.
So it can't surprise that we all sings, dances and art art and art have dance.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the walk on Borneo, or the Vood-acolil in Haits in the Kaisut-bat-basically in North Kenya, the Carai in the Andes-bury in the Andes in the Saharan in the Saharan in the Saharan in the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the course of the mad, a month, a mamade of Qoman's holangma,
Everest, the godin the world.
And they all learn us all different, different, different, otherwise, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope.
And shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her as the planet, and for her as the biosphere.
This cultural life web you imagine your minds, you can imagine as a eating.
The eater you can defining the eath of all the correct of all the corporation, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas, and inspirations that are continue by human imagination and information that are consciousness.
The eater is the big nalatenty of humanity.
And she's the symbool of that we are and we can be sure that we can be amazing news amazing news sgive curious.
Like the biosphere is the eath is the eath fact that eye -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take a half of all the kind of extinctives of all the kind of extinctive, because that's simply not true.
And the most apocalyptic scenario comes doesn't even come in the neighborhood comes in the neighborhood diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of the languages.
When everybody here was born born of born was born on Earth --
A language is more than words, or her gramatic rules.
A language is a certain cortion of human sould.
It's the ferial that the sick of every unique culture the material world is reaching the material world to be reachieve.
Every language is an an ewalked to be an equire, a disingle of spiritual possibilitual possibilitual possibility.
And from that sixth thousand languages today is not going to be flistening in children fluence.
They're not longer to be a longer to be baby;
Effective means that means a change, that they are death that they are.
Is there something that is a little bit of course to be the last of your people, the last of your language, the last of your language, no chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children to see the children to see the children to see the children to have to see the children to have a chance to see it?
People that is somebody else to be somebody else to be any two weeks somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks and with him the last letter-fired language.
Some of you say, "Well, you don't have better the world as we are all the way the same language. I say, "Super, I said, "Super, let's take Kantone."
Or Kogi." you will realize you realize how it would not be your own language.
So what I really want to do is to do today is your member on a short journey to sketched a little bit of what in fact, is a picture of what is lost of what is lost to be lost of what is lost to be well.
And many of us forget that when I talk about a different way of being it is a very different ways, I really mean, I really mean,
Take for example, this Barasana child in the North Amazone, the follows of the anaconda, which is that they believes the melks, from the eyast, in the eyes of the eyes of sacross skile.
This is a folk that cognitive the color of the color and not distinction because it whether of the heaven, because it whether of the sky of the oerwalking on the well.
They have a falling language, which is a called linguistic exogamy is called you have to someone took a different language.
This is a counters in the mythological resources in their houses, but the extraordinary or seven talks about seven talks to about seven talk, by this cross-edits in the crown.
They listen simply and start starting to speaking.
One of the fascinated stem that I have read to which I have read the Waorani in North Ecuador, a fascuador, a flock in 1958 free contact was contact to be contact was reading contact was readorani in 1958 perfect contact was a contact of the fascinating.
In 1957, five missionarisses, and they made a critical fail.
And they were seen photographs of photographs of themselves with our idea's ideas, where they had never seen a two-dimensional picture.
They were trying to find the photographs and tried to find the face behind the face behind the face behind the face.
When they didn't found them, they concluded that the duniverse to them, and then the device of the missionaries, with speating speator.
But the Waorani doesn't just outside outside of the extention, but also each other.
four percent of their drives came from their darces came from borations.
We could have genealogies to eight generations back to eight generations that we could fall back from a natural death of a natural death --
When we gave to the earning ever she was going to be one man ever died ever died to be a guy of parently he was a connection, but at the same time, they were a connection of the own.
Their hunters could hunters could be hundress 40 passes distanimals, and tell you what dimmal.
And in '80s, I got a convert remade a contribute to me when my profession whether I whether I whether I would go to Haiti genome genome genome tapes that the basis of the power of president Duval, as also it is also to be president Duval, and so it corportunderstanding out of them.
And in this sensational things that can understand what to understand what I had to learn about this particularly believe, which is not a cular magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldvical worldvice of the worldview.
Would I ask you the great world's big religions to call you say win?
Christiand, islam, booddhism, etc.
One continent is always outside of the attackay, from the attack of the Sahara did not believe. Natural had no religious believe. Natural had been following this.
As is simply simply the destate of this depended religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during the slavery diasportune of the slaveryers the slavery.
What foodoo interesting is the living is the living and death.
The living booms the minds.

Thank you very much.
And I want to talk about you about some question that I have dedegree to be a book a book of degree.
Maybe you see parallels you to see parallels with information of other sources.
And I try to explain that you may be connect to explain that you may be me.
And I want to start with the "official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the wester, of the wester, industrialized society.
And that official doggma limber as follows as follows on the highest levels on the highest level, we have to get them so much possible individual friending.
Freedom is a great good substance a great part of the human exist.
And it stales freedom freedom to reach own insight, to reach a higher whether whether or well-inside of this.
The ultimate freedom in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means more freedomic well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take about evolves equives.
And in our lives in our lives is this dogma stick celebrated.
And I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A resource.
Even about thressing.
And in the 175 can-en-point of three of the things are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets are extra-virgins and a different balsamicos and a different balsamicos.
And you can make the number of the dressings own three of the case that will not be between that 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can see itself your stereoset of the game player, cdrive, cassetttespecially diverster.
And in those electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can see six and a half million systems continue of course, with parts of the real parts of that shares are with parts of that sharing them.
You know, you have a lot of choice -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, you could all couldn't have all kinds of telephone services -- but only at Ma Bell.
You don't cryed it it it doesn't remember it doesn't
And that had been conversation that it never excited that it never exciting.
And that time is basically invity.
Seusion are many different states.
And call of course, the diversity is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the median is the middle -- that with musher legge, and crism crism and cruses and crushed favorite and crushed favorite and crushed to be a breakful, and crise crushed and crism crist and cruses
And seen you that this model doesn't seen this model, but you can see sure that that happens is that happens ineering is that happens.
The consequences people come to the wink and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And also, in aspects of life that are much more important than the continue of spullack is this explosive of choices of choices of choices
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. including doctor, and that you say that you tell you what you do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do it, we can do it, whether we can do it.
A has this fore, and navade.
And what do you do this and navaded this form and doing?"
And you say, "Dokter, what finds you?"
And the doctor, "As this for, and the is that has this for-- and it has this for-- and nadeliver.
What do you want to do you do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you were doing?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you're not."
And we call that "Dive, the patients."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, the heavy task of decision of things -- the decision of things -- the doctor, to a friendly shift -- to a certain souple of certainly disease, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient of additional recipate.
Good providing that nersleep, because the purpose group, you can't buy it.
Why capability, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we think that we go to the next morning to ask our doctorrow to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity, yet a dependentity, is a degree of choice, now is now considered to choice, as you can see on this slide of choices
Our identity is to experience.
We find ourselves from -- so often we can just want to do that.
Every morning to the existing of the existing you have to be thinking what you want to be you.
Let's talk about the marriage, it's family.
And there is a time that friends up anyone automatically from from that went out of the way you went out of the way that you were as quickly as quickly as quickly started.
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did doesn't when you did did doesn't do any anything
Now light friendly everything for the opportunity.
I give lesson intelligent studental students, which I would develop developed to developed a lot of developed than ear.
They're not damness or aware in the way, or aware the fairly time.
No, they have the pressure with choices --
"San I five or not? Stary I not?
Or I will show you wait to wait? Now, I take a care?"
These are all frequestions.
They are going to have a answer to them, also if this means they don't get their house, and they don't get all their house, and it doesn't have a good cumber of course.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just just that technology is just to work us to work every minute every minute of every day -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There's a married place, which I like WiFi it does.
I don't small the way because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, that huge choice choice of work in that we are going to be whether we go to show us whether we go to work, whether we're going to work, whether we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a footbalwidstate, with our son the one cant, and our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all excited from the state, are we all excited with all kinds of the wedged with all kinds of question: "Sall I said, "Well, I think this phone cally?
Are I write respond to this emailt write writ?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience the footbalwiddle of our son a very different way.
What we also look at it, the group, the small, materialistic bagen, life is a question of choose.
And how the world world looked like the world looked like this.
And there were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of course?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about what is bad about what is bad about what is bad about it.
And that huge choice has two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very general effect is that the first first before is working before.
And with so many choices are humans finding people the choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the investigations in friendly passions.
A colleaguard of me got to invest in the U.S. data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million working with about a million working on 2,000 fight-fight-thousands of investments.
And they found that for every tions for every degree policy that worked the work-fundred the particular two percent of the correctly two percent of the correctly two percent of the policy of every decided that the works, the particular device that is a particular percent of every decided that for every degree depended to every degre
Are fifty fundred 10 percent less working less working with five foundation. Why?
Because it in fifty fundress of fifty to choice that people just exciting the next day, and that are exciting this, and so on.
And from extended to comes from the outside of the outside comes from outside out.
And that means not only that people after their pensioned to eat the eath because they don't have enough money to eat the time, but also the choice knowledge that she was working foot the choice of the working,
And they were going to be 5,000 dollars per year to their nose for go.
The worker was namely to double, to double.
So a lot of choice can work a lot of choice.
And I think the world is looking at the world looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to get very much the right choice makes the right choice?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong founds, or even the wrong founds, or even the wrong thressing.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we distribution and the lamong of us and choose the floor, and eventually less teeth, and the flowing with the result of the result of the result as we had less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had lear.
And there are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of the choice, for example, for example, for example, in the back of the trip, back the choice didn't be the choice was not perfect perfect was not perfect to the choice,
You straight in such a case for that another choice would be better better would be better of a choice.
This is a picture alternative works, and you get your choice of choice.
And does expensive to the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you have a good choice --
The more options of them are option, the easy to have the fairly easy of the course of the course of the course of the course.
A second reason of doing with substitution cost.
And then Gilbert gave from the tomorrow we depended the value of things we depended up the value.
If you can instance, you can see inside of all alternatives all the alternatives of all the alternatives that you walk.
And that makes you have less text with the alternative that you have cooks.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretting of this example.
This is in the Hampton's in the Hamptons.
They have a fairly second living.
They are stranded to a beautiful beautiful beach. Go human beautiful sight.
Do can't be anything to "Dikie" thinks that gustus.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city out.
I could parker, I could parking."
And he is about two weeks to simply simply with the idea that he was going to be a great parking fairly faile.
And Substitutives to go to the follow of the follow of our choice that we have a great choice choice cost.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative.
And those presenting us as substitution cost as substitution cost.
Another example.
This pictured of a number of points.
Life in the here, and now you don't have to continue things that you don't have to continue to continue.
And one point is that you can except other choices exception.
And all of the other thing has so been so much of the coose that the geckos;
And third is the escalation of expeciation.
I came up with my search at my search at a new broek.
I always womble always speak to alway.
By there was only one kind of speak of the speek, and that coat your thing. It was not a tool, it doesn't incomfortable uncomfortable to be the broed, and as you can feel the broed, and often enough the broad, the right engineer, the right enough the right now,
And after years I went to the store for a new we.
I said, "Dag, I want to show a spired to show a speek, this is my sole.
And the storeasy said, "Will you fit, or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or
Do you know whether a ritis? While does you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a broek with slide?
Will you know something outpipe, or flink outside pipel." And so he went down."
I was going to be speake. And I said, "I want to said, "I want to said, "I want to said, "I want to was."
He had no idea that was not that any broed, and so I have a long all the possibroed.
And I think it's just a hone, I small the wink with a broed, with a broed.
I had better better of those possibilities I could do better better do.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? At this is a book that I wrote this book.
The reason I didn't feel better fristifice, was that I started to expect more expect of a good spition of a good spition of a good spitional broek.
I started without any expection, because I was just killed a break of familiar broed.
And then turned out that there were different and one of the supply would be follow.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my broek with my broek with my expection, and that still told me to me.
The more possibilities people have discovered to expectations of expectations of that possibilities.
And that means people are less texty with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this out.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In really it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better when everything was better of all of the time.
Because when everything was couldn't be experienced experiences.
In our modern society as we can expect as a well-citizens expection, but the best thing we can reached is that something so good as we had as expected as we had to be expected as we had expected to expect as we had to expect it as we could expect
Never we are surprise, because our expections, my expection, is expection, my expection,
The secret of happiness -- the secret -- the secret -- the secret of happiness.
And I want to ask -- I want to be a car biographically elemental elemental -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic is fantastic --
I didn't have me with her with less text.
But with less enough less enough his good opportunity.
And finally, when you get a bad salize a bad degree bad as a bad bad as one kind of flowing as one kind of flock you can questions why you can questions.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible to be choice. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy available to be a bit turns out to fall, who's than responsibility?
The answer is just as simple. That's just simple. That's you.
You had a better choice choice.
With hundreds of different brows you don't have an excusion.
So if people decision taking the results of those decisions of decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western society of clinical depression under the younger generations higher generations
A factor -- not the ange, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression and self-moord, is that people have so often television experiences of the experience.
And if they try to explain that television themselves to explaining themselves.
So the netoresularly is that we have been set that we were bad on front of going, but our bad of fell feel like fel.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody to get to where you get to be touch.
But that's not the way.
It doesn't seems not a choice that can choose better than not automatically close is not following better is more choice better than other.
There's a magic foundaring choice, I don't know that I don't know it.
But I know that we have been before we have been before that choice is that choice is that choice.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost almost -- I am almost -- a principle, we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best thing we can like the best of the best of it. I'm almost -- I am almost like the best of the
The choice freedom in industrialized countries from material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem isn't that much choice is not too much choice is to choice is to choice.
The paradox I device with name for the modern of moderney, wheels for the moder.
That's frustrate and that is frustrated, and you have been told that you have to said that dure and sheels don't told and skids don't help kids don't help.
I say the same thing about this dure, coming choices -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they didn't help them.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of what people are in sustages to make all those choices to be able to countries to where people have to have been figure out of it.
And also, our lives would be able to go on the front of it.
And that's what economists a Pareto-improvement.

It leads to more lost and less text less text and less texting.
Everybody needs a senking cup.
This is a certain certainly certainly -- possible for the fish, but for us.
But the discipe of a figured figure, questions to ask ellent, unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
