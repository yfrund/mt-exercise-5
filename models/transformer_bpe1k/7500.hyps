F@@ or@@ i@@ on years I was a very very very in@@ t@@ ro@@ l L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ H@@ .

E@@ n@@ or@@ m c@@ or@@ y c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
This is the m@@ us@@ t G@@ en@@ e@@ d@@ n't have a f@@ i@@ ma@@ ch@@ in@@ .
We were f@@ o@@ to@@ da@@ y of the B@@ i@@ b@@ le B@@ i@@ an@@ g@@ an@@ g@@ er in the c@@ or@@ t@@ or@@ t@@ or@@ s and I was the wor@@ k L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ S@@ A@@ L@@ S@@ A@@ L@@ S@@ A@@ L@@ S@@ t@@ at@@ ter@@ .

A@@ t 1@@ 0 years of 1@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ ver@@ n@@ , we were going to be the s@@ ame for the s@@ ame for the s@@ ame for the s@@ ame for the s@@ k@@ e.
This is the f@@ o@@ t@@ y wor@@ ld by A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ .
Th@@ at at is a con@@ t@@ ro@@ ss the con@@ t@@ ro@@ ss in the con@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ .
It's a f@@ o@@ t@@ o f@@ o@@ t@@ y of the first c@@ oun@@ t@@ ter that c@@ oun@@ t@@ y with H@@ er@@ , and you know, H@@ er@@ e's a p@@ ie@@ d of L@@ H@@ er@@ e's a little b@@ le of H@@ er@@ e's a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ s in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , in the c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se of the c@@ our@@ c@@ or@@ .
M@@ an@@ other wor@@ d that we c@@ our@@ se@@ , and we c@@ our@@ se in 1@@ 0 S@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er we c@@ or@@ m@@ er that the wor@@ king that we c@@ or@@ n@@ or@@ n@@ or@@ n@@ or@@ n@@ ing me a c@@ or@@ n@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
I don't know the most of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , you know, the most c@@ our@@ se@@ , or G@@ oo@@ l@@ s or G@@ oo@@ l@@ and sa@@ y that the In@@ ter@@ n@@ ing and sa@@ y that the inter@@ est@@ ing and sa@@ w that the inter@@ est@@ ing and so so it like th@@ is.
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s that we have a c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ al sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ fu@@ l s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y p@@ ac@@ t of p@@ ac@@ t p@@ ac@@ t p@@ ac@@ t of c@@ ul@@ t.
And a proble@@ m of a proble@@ m with a proble@@ m with a proble@@ m with the way we had a proble@@ m@@ s with this proble@@ m@@ m@@ s of this proble@@ m.
Th@@ at di@@ b@@ ra@@ l 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 3 m@@ us@@ t on the m@@ us@@ t on the c@@ ra@@ l of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The en@@ d@@ in@@ n@@ ing you to think you to sa@@ y, "@@ N@@ e@@ : "@@ N@@ o "@@ N@@ o is not going to think it is a b@@ ra@@ d@@ ."
And they can do that they can do that s@@ een the su@@ per@@ at@@ ed on his f@@ ol@@ lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So in 2@@ 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ , 2@@ 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ , the c@@ our@@ se@@ s that are the s@@ our@@ se@@ , which can be the s@@ ame da@@ y.
In one of the b@@ in@@ t@@ in@@ t@@ ly things like the ne@@ x@@ t of the L@@ L@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ L@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ L@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ L@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ L@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ H@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ C@

This was the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ y s@@ ul@@ t.
This is more in@@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ en you know, if you can get a b@@ al@@ is@@ e that ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts than 2@@ 0 per@@ cen@@ t@@ ter than 2@@ 0 per@@ cen@@ t@@ ter than 2@@ 0 per@@ cen@@ t@@ ter 1@@ 0 per@@ cen@@ t@@ ter of 1@@ 0 per@@ cen@@ t@@ ter of th@@ ou@@ s in the c@@ oun@@ d.
We had a c@@ our@@ se@@ , 5@@ 0 d@@ one of 5@@ 0 m@@ us@@ .
We had to do it out of a little b@@ re@@ ad of h@@ al@@ f of what we di@@ d do@@ .
We all have all of all of the@@ m.
No@@ w they are in a very very very very very mu@@ ch on a very very very very mu@@ ch on a very very very da@@ y.
E@@ in@@ d the L@@ i@@ ma@@ de H@@ in@@ t is going to be the H@@ in@@ t@@ ac@@ t H@@ in@@ .
We know that there are a little b@@ as@@ e of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se and we can be able to be in your b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally in your b@@ as@@ e of c@@ li@@ v@@ es in the b@@ oo@@ t of the b@@ oo@@ ks of the b@@ oo@@ l@@ s of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ .
N@@ u@@ , of c@@ our@@ se@@ , n@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ , c@@ our@@ se@@ , the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , is is very very very very very s@@ oc@@ ie@@ c@@ es of the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
I think it is that it was that it was a m@@ us@@ t to think it is that we we are going to think the L@@ C@@ . And the L@@ L@@ C@@ .

You know, I had a very very very very very very very very very very very pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ t@@ or@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and it can be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new of of new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new way of new new new new new new new new new new way of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We st@@ ar@@ ound a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to get the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and we are going to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get a new c@@ our@@ se@@ s in the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and a new p@@ as@@ si@@ on in the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y sy@@ n@@ st@@ and@@ s of sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ .
So we have been tr@@ ying to tr@@ ying to be a very very very very very very very very very very g@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
"@@ Wh@@ at is something I think what man@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ o@@ ther@@ , what man@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ o@@ d to be able to be able to be a differ@@ ent differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ er@@ .
We have differ@@ ent of pro@@ duc@@ ed pro@@ te@@ ach@@ er@@ s are tr@@ ac@@ k to be im@@ al@@ s to de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
We are the b@@ al@@ iz@@ ed 2@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ ver@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ h@@ .
And then we have in@@ cre@@ di@@ d the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and we have been s@@ ha@@ vi@@ v@@ al@@ an@@ al@@ s of the an@@ al@@ s of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld of the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
No@@ w we can tr@@ y to do a new way we can re@@ al@@ on@@ der@@ s, or we can en@@ er@@ s, or we can p@@ ut this new new p@@ ri@@ v@@ es of these p@@ ri@@ d@@ ?
This is the m@@ all of a little b@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ m@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the kind of c@@ our@@ se of kind of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se that kind of c@@ op@@ er@@ s, in a c@@ ul@@ at@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ y in a c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ y in a c@@ op@@ ul@@ at@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation@@ .
And we have to tr@@ ying to get a little b@@ il@@ l or a little b@@ us@@ t of c@@ oo@@ d.
We can be in the or@@ der of the h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and the h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so we are more or or so so so so so so so so so so so so so we are in the b@@ il@@ l in the or@@ der of the or@@ der of 5@@ 00 or 5@@ 00 or 5@@ 00 or 5@@ 00 or 5@@ 00 people who are in the or@@ der of the or@@ ig@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er and the or@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ er of the or@@ h@@ un@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ .
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ an@@ y of the me@@ t@@ an@@ y is that are all of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , which is that are f@@ re@@ e@@ p with the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
G@@ o@@ ve this is a qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is a qu@@ ic@@ e.
But when we can get to get to get all the c@@ op@@ e that we can get to get a p@@ ie@@ s, and we can get a p@@ ie@@ s, it's a very very very very very very very c@@ op@@ ul@@ ly that was a c@@ op@@ ul@@ ly le@@ c@@ op@@ ul@@ ar to be a li@@ ve of lif@@ e.
We de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that the on@@ ly re@@ al@@ e was a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very comp@@ le@@ tel@@ y sy@@ n@@ g@@ is@@ m is that we could be a comp@@ an@@ y comp@@ le@@ ar@@ ound the comp@@ le@@ x of the m@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s to be a very very very very very un@@ der@@ st@@ ra@@ in the un@@ m@@ us@@ t of the p@@ as@@ e and to be a very very very very c@@ is@@ su@@ ch of c@@ or@@ m@@ ate of the p@@ ra@@ in the p@@ ra@@ is@@ h@@ t of the p@@ ast sy@@ st@@ em@@ er@@ s of the p@@ op@@ ul@@ ar c
And so we have to do with his f@@ ra@@ in the s@@ m@@ al@@ s with a un@@ ch@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ k@@ s@@ s@@ k@@ ?
S@@ ch@@ em@@ y the p@@ ut it in a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very li@@ m@@ ul@@ ar and en@@ ough we have to see that c@@ ul@@ ar to see that have to see it to see the@@ y@@ ?
E@@ n@@ , if we can do a ch@@ ro@@ s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, "@@ W@@ e@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ om@@ s is a p@@ ie@@ s, but you know, you know, a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ i@@ al@@ .
So, our p@@ ut us to be us of the p@@ op@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ si@@ on is im@@ p@@ en@@ ti@@ ons of ex@@ p@@ on@@ e.
O@@ n@@ e to c@@ our@@ se@@ , to c@@ our@@ se@@ , but is the c@@ our@@ se@@ , but is c@@ lo@@ ve of the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And our l@@ ast p@@ un@@ t of this is on a very very very very very ex@@ p@@ on@@ es on a p@@ on@@ es of ex@@ p@@ on@@ es on a p@@ on@@ es of c@@ our@@ c@@ or@@ .
We have 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ ver@@ n@@ ed 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a p@@ ut of c@@ our@@ se@@ , for a bi@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ a bi@@ o@@ -@@ c@@ or@@ t de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing to ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But the sy@@ n@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ : N@@ A N@@ A N@@ A of N@@ A A m@@ ir@@ .
Th@@ ere are man@@ y s@@ ho@@ w@@ s in the wor@@ ld in the m@@ all of the wor@@ ld that are s@@ m@@ all of D@@ N@@ A in the wor@@ ld in 5@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent in the l@@ en@@ er@@ g@@ in@@ ation@@ , and it's a very very very very very very very very very very very da@@ y, and it's more more more more more more and how you know, how to be more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more to be more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more
So we had to make a new new new new new of the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ h of these things to make these these c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ h of these p@@ ie@@ s.
And this was our first in@@ form@@ ation@@ , with the first in@@ form@@ ation with the c@@ or@@ m@@ ate of the c@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ al c@@ or@@ m@@ er was 1@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little b@@ ac@@ ter in a b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e in the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ig@@ .
We were the p@@ ut the p@@ ie@@ d the p@@ ie@@ d the f@@ our@@ s of c@@ or@@ re@@ d the f@@ our@@ c@@ tion@@ .
and then a D@@ N@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l c@@ u@@ l c@@ u@@ l c@@ u@@ l
The an@@ n@@ ing in@@ cre@@ ate of a stu@@ dy of th@@ r@@ ough a p@@ ie@@ d of the b@@ ig@@ n@@ ing or the b@@ ig@@ n@@ ing in the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e c@@ ir@@ d the c@@ ir@@ d and the c@@ ir@@ d the c@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ c@@ or@@ s and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ ar@@ y c@@ ir@@ th@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al c@@ ell@@ s are f@@ ir@@ al c@@ ell@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s and the c@@ ell@@ s and the c@@ ell@@ .
I was a l@@ on@@ g in the sp@@ re@@ e@@ very l@@ on@@ g with the in@@ du@@ str@@ y and I was that they had to be a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed that they had to be a very mu@@ ch of c@@ ap@@ e.
And they were more than a lo@@ ve of you@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we think this is a sit@@ u@@ ation in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we want to do something a lo@@ t of the gre@@ at the gre@@ at is a lo@@ t of the ter@@ m@@ s of the ter@@ m@@ b@@ er of the c@@ er@@ .
We wan@@ ted to be the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al mo@@ s@@ k@@ il@@ .
Th@@ at's 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ t@@ or@@ s c@@ o@@ de@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we had to be able to be able to be able in c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of c@@ as@@ s@@ si@@ de of c@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ e in c@@ as@@ e in c@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ e in c@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ e in c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ us@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ si
And to be a little b@@ ig@@ n@@ ing of what the d@@ oe@@ s are in@@ cre@@ ate comp@@ le@@ ar@@ y of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a comp@@ le@@ tel@@ y comp@@ le@@ tel@@ y of a comp@@ le@@ t@@ y comp@@ le@@ t@@ y comp@@ le@@ .
The de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed is a c@@ ru@@ c@@ i@@ al in@@ form@@ ation with in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter in the comp@@ u@@ ter that are in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter that are in the comp@@ u@@ ter in the comp@@ u@@ ter in the c@@ ra@@ in@@ form@@ ation in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ ra@@ in the comp@@ u@@ ter of c@@ ra@@ in the comp@@ u@@ ter of c@@ or@@ m@@ is@@ si@@ b@@ le c@@ or@@ y in the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ t@@ ter in the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
T@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ing this c@@ our@@ se in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ , in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ , was 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ , was one of a f@@ ol@@ d 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ d.
F@@ in@@ n@@ ed in the c@@ our@@ se we had been re@@ al@@ re@@ e@@ d, we had been f@@ ound the sp@@ ac@@ e c@@ our@@ se to get the c@@ u@@ re@@ d was not in the c@@ u@@ re@@ e in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And in the wor@@ th of the di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed is the wor@@ ld that are de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed that are c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ d to be a lo@@ ve of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of c@@ our@@ s of c@@ our@@ s and to be a little b@@ as@@ e of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ er@@ s that we have to be a little b@@ as@@ e of c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s that we have to be a c@@ er@@ g@@ er of c@@ am@@ oun@@ d.
We were very un@@ der@@ st@@ and in@@ cre@@ ate her@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be a little b@@ as@@ e in the wat@@ er@@ er of the m@@ ight of c@@ oun@@ d.
B@@ e@@ : : W@@ e@@ 've got a vi@@ de@@ d c@@ op@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ di@@ d S@@ c@@ e@@ t@@ or@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ : A@@ :
T@@ o@@ 's le@@ t@@ ter of those le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for 2@@ 0 c@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ se -- and a c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se -- and a b@@ ra@@ in in c@@ our@@ se is for a b@@ as@@ e for in@@ f@@ ul@@ ar for in@@ o@@ ther@@ .
So we can use the c@@ our@@ se@@ , to use the wor@@ ld to use the wor@@ ld to use the wor@@ ld of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
A@@ n@@ d, we had been ne@@ er@@ ed a m@@ all of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were c@@ or@@ s were no e@@ ur@@ e of them were not a di@@ d of th@@ is.
We have this th@@ r@@ ough these stu@@ f@@ f that we can be that we can be that we can be able to be that we can be able to be a p@@ ie@@ s.
Th@@ ere are are are are re@@ as@@ ons in and in the p@@ ut in and in the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And we star@@ ted to get to get a p@@ ie@@ d with th@@ r@@ ough to star@@ ted with the s@@ li@@ v@@ es that 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ as@@ e of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get to get to get 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ re@@ d to get 1@@ 0@@ 00 people who are about 2@@ 0@@ 00 people to get 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ .
In fac@@ t, we have a f@@ lo@@ t of this p@@ lo@@ t of these stu@@ den@@ ts of these th@@ is, we want to get this stu@@ dy of these th@@ re@@ se@@ , because we want to get a pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent of pro@@ c@@ ent of pro@@ c@@ ent -- and that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that is that you can see that is that you can see that you can see that is that you can see that is that you can see that that is that that is that that that is that you can see a lo@@ ve of these c@@ u@@ re@@ s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ie@@ s.
We tr@@ y to tr@@ ying to be the p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ at@@ er@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So this is a b@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ as@@ in@@ form@@ ation@@ .
A@@ s we don't have been very very very very very very very very p@@ ie@@ d -- and it really really really really th@@ ough@@ t 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ , and they get in E@@ c@@ li@@ k@@ e.
Th@@ at is the c@@ ul@@ ar the en@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ s of the c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we have to do the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other an@@ is@@ m.
We di@@ d a me@@ an@@ is@@ h@@ om@@ e that I can use c@@ alle@@ d me c@@ alle@@ d me that is that that it is that that the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to be us@@ ed by N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ N@@ A N@@ N@@ N@@ A lo@@ ve b@@ as@@ e c@@ as@@ e c@@ as@@ e and you can get a lo@@ ve b@@ oo@@ d.
H@@ er@@ e's a kind of ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .

Th@@ at is in the bo@@ dy of the p@@ an@@ gu@@ y mo@@ s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, "@@ W@@ ell, it is c@@ oo@@ l@@ y, of c@@ oo@@ d.
1@@ 2 2@@ 2 2@@ 4 2@@ 4 2@@ 4 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ se in the c@@ ame wa@@ y.
Th@@ ere are man@@ y in the c@@ our@@ se@@ s that these an@@ is@@ m@@ s that these an@@ other thing@@ s.
This is going to be able to be able to be a lo@@ ve of lif@@ e.
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m in a f@@ i@@ ve lif@@ e.
I know you know, you know, a new b@@ ol@@ u@@ re@@ , you can get in the c@@ our@@ se in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be in the un@@ im@@ po@@ in@@ t of a new b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of c@@ at@@ or@@ s can be a new b@@ il@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ ic@@ i@@ al mil@@ li@@ on of d@@ ol@@ ic@@ al b@@ il@@ li@@ on to be a new b@@ il@@ li@@ on the c@@ or@@ .
N@@ A@@ S@@ tr@@ an@@ y has been been been s@@ how man@@ y of you see her@@ e.
H@@ er@@ e's a very very very very very m@@ ic@@ ro@@ f@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ c@@ u@@ l with this pro@@ c@@ u@@ l is that we have been with this c@@ u@@ l with this c@@ u@@ l with this c@@ u@@ l with a very very s@@ m@@ ic@@ an@@ is@@ h of the p@@ ol@@ d of the p@@ ie@@ st of the wor@@ ld in the p@@ ie@@ st of the wor@@ ld in the p@@ ho@@ w@@ er of the p@@ ho@@ t@@ or@@ s.
G@@ ir@@ t of that they have that they are f@@ oo@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ or@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ s of th@@ ir@@ s.
This is not a spec@@ ies ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ d@@ -@@ f@@ o@@ b@@ le p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ .
It's a lo@@ t of c@@ u@@ p@@ le mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l with a li@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ss a c@@ u@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ .
This is f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ y@@ s, and a c@@ our@@ se of the con@@ si@@ de of the con@@ si@@ de@@ d

We have no@@ w no@@ w that c@@ om@@ e sy@@ n@@ n@@ al sy@@ n@@ n@@ al sy@@ n@@ st@@ em@@ s to do th@@ is, to do so so so the c@@ om@@ e of the c@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ om@@ e@@ d@@ s.
We have to make the mo@@ b@@ le is to be a bi@@ g b@@ ro@@ w@@ om@@ en and a mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ d and a very da@@ y and p@@ ut h@@ op@@ e and p@@ ut a very da@@ y and p@@ ut a very very da@@ y.

This is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very kind of what is a new kind of what is going to be a new kind of what we can do do to do that that that you can do do that that that is going to do it really really really really really can do to do a new kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of the kind of of kind of the kind of of of bebebebebebebebebebebebe@@ ter in the kind of of the kind of that that comp@@ u@@ ter of what is a new kind of what the comp@@ u@@ ter of what is a new kind of what is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very new way of what is a new new kind of what is a new new new new kind of what kind of what kind of what is going to be a new new way of what is that that you can do is a new kind of what a new kind of what kind of what kind of what is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what kind of what is is be@@ ter@@ ter@@ ter@@ m@@ ter@@ ter@@ ter@@ ter@@ ter@@ m@@ en@@ ter@@ ter@@ ien

We re@@ as@@ on the f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ i@@ re@@ .

We have been the ne@@ x@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s that are f@@ oun@@ ds of that are f@@ re@@ a@@ st@@ and@@ s that are f@@ lo@@ t of th@@ re@@ e and to be more or to be more than a differ@@ ent of differ@@ ent spec@@ ies like th@@ re@@ e or more of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent spec@@ ies of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent c@@ or@@ s of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent spec@@ ies of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent spec@@ ies of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent spec@@ ent of differ@@ ent differ@@ ent t@@ ol@@ s.
But the on@@ ly way we think that we have a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y is that we have f@@ oo@@ d, and the f@@ oo@@ d, and to be a b@@ as@@ e and to be a b@@ oo@@ ks and to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to C@@ A@@ l@@ s C@@ A@@ l@@ d@@ ri@@ d@@ ge C@@ A@@ l@@ s are wh@@ y we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we have been f@@ ar@@ ound the way that the way that that the way that the way that the f@@ oo@@ l@@ ab@@ il@@ ity of the f@@ ol@@ lo@@ t of the way that that that that we have the way that the way that the way that we can think we have the f@@ oo@@ t of the f@@ oo@@ l@@ s that we have the way we think we think we can think we can think we think we think we can think we think we think we think we think we can think we think we think we can can can can can can can can think we can think we think we think we think we think we think we think about the b@@ al@@ al@@ ir@@ on@@ y@@ ent b@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ un@@ ough@@ al@@ oun@@ th@@ on@
S@@ u@@ m@@ s and C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ , but -- but -- -- -- -- -- -- -- but by our wor@@ ld -- but by our wor@@ ld -- but by our c@@ ou@@ t, we have all all all other other other peop@@ le@@ , we have all other other other other other other other peop@@ le@@ .
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed that we have that 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
The le@@ ar@@ t in the di@@ d di@@ d in the di@@ d 2@@ 5 d@@ ri@@ v@@ en 2@@ 5 di@@ d to be a di@@ c@@ es of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The me@@ me@@ me@@ di@@ d of A@@ C@@ O@@ 2 and with A@@ c@@ ul@@ a@@ v@@ al@@ .
We can get the v@@ ir@@ d or C@@ O@@ 2 per@@ c@@ as@@ e to be a p@@ ri@@ p@@ p@@ ut to be a p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed to be in the p@@ ri@@ v@@ es that C@@ O@@ ter@@ r@@ e C@@ O@@ K@@ , which is c@@ or@@ m@@ s to be in this c@@ our@@ se@@ .
So in a b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ra@@ in that we are are in that we are we are in his b@@ ra@@ in that we are b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ra@@ in a b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
We have been a little b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally have to be the c@@ our@@ se@@ , you have to do the p@@ ri@@ v@@ es and the p@@ ri@@ v@@ es of in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ v@@ e.
You can do not do this is not to do you can do this is what you can do it it do@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ y b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y in the b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
But we think we think it is us@@ t the use of these wor@@ king of these wor@@ king of these wor@@ king and to be us@@ ing these c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c
This was the 1@@ 0 years we had a very very very s@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ wa@@ ys and the c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ .
I can think that it can think that can be chan@@ ge@@ d by c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ ess of c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ in@@ .
H@@ ere you can see that the fu@@ tur@@ e of sy@@ n@@ n@@ ing that the fu@@ tur@@ e is that the chan@@ ge@@ , is going to see it is going to see it in sy@@ n@@ n@@ ing and in@@ cre@@ di@@ c@@ al sy@@ n@@ em@@ s with sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ n@@ ing sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ , and in@@ du@@ str@@ at@@ e@@ t@@ y@@ ar@@ y in@@ o@@ ther@@ .
We have f@@ ound the f@@ i@@ ver@@ n@@ ed of th@@ r@@ ough the be@@ t@@ ter of th@@ is.
O@@ n@@ e is that we have a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very da@@ y to do you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Wh@@ at I want to see the un@@ der@@ st@@ , is the un@@ da@@ men@@ t, is the un@@ da@@ y of a new new new new new new new new new new way of M@@ am@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ how a new new new new new new new new new new new new new s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s
And it's a om@@ ent of c@@ our@@ se in your f@@ oo@@ l@@ y, or or or or or or or or f@@ oo@@ d.
We me@@ an@@ s of man@@ y of c@@ our@@ se@@ s are f@@ ig@@ n@@ ing and then you can get to get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a b@@ ir@@ d and w@@ ent and our in@@ f@@ ig@@ n@@ ing and our b@@ ig@@ n@@ ing and our c@@ or@@ s and our b@@ ig@@ n@@ or@@ s and our c@@ or@@ s and our c@@ or@@ s and our c@@ or@@ s and our c@@ or@@ n@@ ing and our c@@ or@@ s and our c@@ or@@ y and our b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e and our c@@ or@@ s and w@@ ent of our and our b@@ ig@@ n
And it ma@@ de out of you don't have a lo@@ t of c@@ or@@ m@@ us@@ ing this c@@ or@@ m@@ s are c@@ or@@ m@@ s or c@@ or@@ m@@ s are c@@ or@@ m@@ us@@ .
The me@@ st of his his his f@@ o@@ to@@ p are c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ a c@@ am@@ a is b@@ as@@ e or a b@@ as@@ s@@ ic@@ a L@@ i@@ a of L@@ ar@@ y L@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ ar@@ y C@@ on@@ ar@@ y C@@ on@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ s, in 3@@ 3@@ 00 d@@ ar@@ y in 3@@ 00 b@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ , or 3@@ 00 d@@ at@@ or@@ , but this is in 3@@ 00 m@@ us@@ .
It all all all of that the on@@ ly con@@ st@@ at@@ ed the most im@@ po@@ s@@ si@@ de of what would would would would be a f@@ oo@@ l@@ y, a p@@ sy@@ st@@ em@@ s in sy@@ st@@ em@@ s on the p@@ ri@@ v@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ .
It's al@@ so a f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ on is im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a b@@ oo@@ k, a b@@ oo@@ k, of c@@ our@@ se@@ , of you know, --
This is a gra@@ p@@ p@@ le of D@@ ic@@ ally is a f@@ ol@@ e to a lo@@ t of th@@ r@@ ough a f@@ ol@@ d.
And to see that it is that it is that that the te@@ ach@@ er@@ , and not a c@@ our@@ se and so so we can do something that is not so so so so so so so so so we can do something that this is not a b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
M@@ is@@ h is a f@@ re@@ as@@ e of what is a b@@ oo@@ l@@ s to get a way to make a way to make a way to get a way to get a way to make a way to make a way to make a way to make a way to make a b@@ oo@@ d.
I would not not be a very mu@@ ch of it.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ al@@ ist@@ s is a lo@@ w of G@@ u@@ di@@ an@@ . This is a lo@@ ve G@@ u@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very very very very very very very very very very very b@@ ar@@ ound in a de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing of a de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
This is a very very very very very f@@ ar@@ ound the p@@ ap@@ er of a f@@ ar@@ ound and the f@@ ar@@ e@@ very b@@ re@@ ad or f@@ ri@@ f@@ t or a f@@ ran@@ k@@ er@@ , or a di@@ sc@@ al@@ e b@@ as@@ e of di@@ u@@ m is a m@@ al@@ s of di@@ u@@ m
We have a little b@@ as@@ ed with this h@@ oo@@ l of these c@@ our@@ se@@ , G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ a@@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ es of c@@ our@@ se -- and h@@ om@@ e man@@ y -- there is a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se -- -- -- and a b@@ ra@@ d@@ in@@ a b@@ as@@ e of in@@ form@@ ation -- and in@@ form@@ ation -- and in@@ form@@ ation@@ .
I@@ f you can see this mo@@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ es of these p@@ ut it out of this p@@ ut it out of this do@@ ing it to see it do@@ ing it to see it do@@ ing it to see it is you see it do@@ w@@ .
O@@ r other other other other c@@ our@@ se@@ , or s@@ ame spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And these ide@@ a that we can do that the c@@ or@@ der to be that the per@@ ien@@ ce of h@@ and@@ s and the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
We don't know that this p@@ op@@ p@@ op@@ e that this p@@ op@@ s are more and other other other and other other and other other other c@@ our@@ se@@ .
No@@ w, of c@@ our@@ se are l@@ and@@ s for a h@@ and the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the c@@ our@@ se@@ , I will be a gre@@ at a way to be a very very very da@@ y of a technolog@@ y of a gre@@ at way we can be a lo@@ t of th@@ is, so mu@@ ch of this is a lo@@ t of th@@ is, we can be a lo@@ t of th@@ r@@ ough a lo@@ t of th@@ re@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
This is all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in a b@@ as@@ e of a f@@ i@@ ve on a S@@ N@@ A of the N@@ A N@@ A A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something something something something something something something something something something something something something something differ@@ en@@ t.
This is a tr@@ en@@ s in the W@@ e@@ b@@ le W@@ e@@ b@@ er it is the c@@ oun@@ d.
This pro@@ jec@@ t P@@ h@@ o@@ sy@@ n@@ n@@ , who are two of two c@@ our@@ se@@ , who are not c@@ ou@@ t.
O@@ n@@ e of S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ ds is a very very very very comp@@ u@@ ter@@ , and it's a lo@@ t of f@@ oo@@ k@@ es by N@@ a@@ h S@@ t@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ h@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ t@@ t@@ in@@ , and so the W@@ as@@ s@@ in@@ as@@ s@@ si@@ on S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ t@@ on@@ g S@@ te@@ c@@ ent of S@@ t@@ or@@ n@@ ing on S@@ te@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ d@@ ra@@ in S@@ t@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ an@@ y S@@ t@@ ro@@ ss S@@ t@@ ol@@ d by S@@ t@@ ar@@ y S@@ on@@ e@@ d@@ ra@@ z@@ ing c@@ er@@ .

So this is a li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ le@@ . It's c@@ lo@@ ve by S@@ e@@ a@@ g@@ on@@ e.
Wh@@ en we can see this is we see that the c@@ our@@ se@@ , we can do it by the c@@ ul@@ ti@@ ons and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ve f@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ se@@ .
The c@@ our@@ se@@ con@@ c@@ er@@ ation of the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ ol@@ d f@@ i@@ ter@@ s have these these these c@@ as@@ e of these c@@ our@@ se@@ , so that we have been very very very s@@ ho@@ w@@ s with the G@@ ra@@ l and the G@@ ra@@ l G@@ ra@@ l L@@ a@@ i L@@ a@@ di@@ men@@ t@@ si@@ ons in L@@ i@@ an@@ s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y -- and the s@@ oc@@ an@@ y of the s@@ oc@@ an@@ c@@ es of these things -- and the s@@ our@@ se@@ s are the s@@ am@@ p@@ s of these things are in@@ cre@@ at@@ ing things are the s@@ qu@@ est@@ im@@ p@@ an@@ s of these things are are are p@@ an@@ ce of these things in the c@@ as@@ k and p@@ ie@@ s, and the s@@ t@@ ly p@@ as@@ ic@@ e and the s@@ k@@ es are the things are of these things are of these things are the c@@ as@@ er@@ s of these things or the c@@ oun@@ t@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ t@@ e.
I don't know an@@ y@@ 're al@@ wa@@ ys a little b@@ il@@ l of other other other thing in the c@@ oun@@ d.
Th@@ ere are man@@ y mu@@ ch more im@@ al@@ .
I want to get a lo@@ t of N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ , N@@ a@@ -@@ d@@ at@@ a p@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing and a f@@ ro@@ p@@ e of p@@ ut a p@@ ut p@@ ut a p@@ ut to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ s that we are c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that we are c@@ alle@@ d this is a c@@ om@@ e in the c@@ as@@ e of c@@ as@@ k -- is a c@@ or@@ s -- in the c@@ or@@ t of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ ra@@ in@@ s of c@@ our@@ c@@ es of c@@ our@@ s -- is a b@@ ra@@ in the c@@ as@@ e of c@@ ro@@ p@@ sy@@ n@@ er@@ s of our c@@ our@@ c@@ es -- is in the c@@ oun@@ d@@ om@@ ent of c@@ as@@ e and a lo@@ t of c@@ oo@@ t@@ un@@ ic@@ at@@ ter@@ .
We had to do with the f@@ re@@ s@@ ing with the oc@@ en@@ t@@ y with the oc@@ en@@ c@@ e.
This is a re@@ con@@ st@@ ri@@ b@@ le of N@@ am@@ p@@ le D@@ am@@ p@@ le of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ e, you get out of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, in F@@ l@@ am@@ , in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ or@@ s, and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ or@@ s and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ ess and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ tion of c@@ or@@ y in the c@@ ir@@ c@@ tion of the c@@ ir@@ c@@ tu@@ re@@ e in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
And you know, these or@@ an@@ y of these or@@ an@@ y of these b@@ ra@@ l is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very b@@ le@@ ar@@ n of this de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing of this de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
And so these are all of these c@@ op@@ p@@ en@@ s of these things that these m@@ ight im@@ por@@ t@@ y of these things that these im@@ p@@ en@@ ing im@@ p@@ p@@ op@@ p@@ ic@@ e.
And we can get on the f@@ ol@@ d on the s@@ our@@ se@@ , they can be f@@ ig@@ er@@ .
W@@ ell, I had been been been been been been th@@ ough@@ t M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@
It's so the c@@ our@@ se is so so so that that that is so f@@ i@@ ve in that c@@ our@@ se@@ .
I think that this is that you can see that this is that this ma@@ de that this is that this c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, c@@ am@@ er@@ s of c@@ am@@ er@@ s, c@@ am@@ er@@ s, "@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ s, "@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ s, a little b@@ oo@@ d, a little b@@ oo@@ d, in these c@@ am@@ er@@ s, in these c@@ am@@ er@@ s, in these c@@ am@@ er@@ s, in these c@@ am@@ er@@ , in these c@@ am@@ er@@ ta@@ in this c@@ am@@ er@@ ta@@ in this c@@ am@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d a b@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ d.
Th@@ ere are man@@ y of th@@ r@@ ough by f@@ i@@ on and e@@ very very s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y.
E@@ ver@@ se are s@@ ame s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ ame of of of f@@ o@@ to@@ p --
This is the s@@ ame of the N@@ o@@ b@@ er D@@ o D@@ o D@@ o D@@ o is a g@@ ood c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
I@@ f we have the f@@ our@@ se in a f@@ i@@ ve in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ k@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ e.
Wh@@ at we can do do this is that that we can do to do with the oc@@ i@@ al things that we can do with the oc@@ i@@ al c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of the d@@ at@@ a -- -- the d@@ at@@ a -- -- the c@@ or@@ n@@ ing c@@ or@@ it@@ y, the A@@ n@@ s -- the A@@ n@@ c@@ le@@ c@@ tion@@ , the c@@ op@@ er@@ .
A@@ l these f@@ o@@ to@@ s are with your f@@ o@@ to@@ p with your b@@ as@@ e is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very b@@ ig@@ h of the b@@ ig@@ h of the b@@ oo@@ d.
And you have a mo@@ de@@ l of the A@@ ar@@ th of the A@@ ar@@ th A@@ ar@@ th A@@ ar@@ th of the A@@ ar@@ th of the A@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And so this is a very very s@@ ho@@ w@@ er on S@@ te@@ m@@ s L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ s and L@@ a@@ w@@ .
And this is something in a very very very very very very very comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity in a comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity and they use the en@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
H@@ u@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ wn and p@@ ho@@ w@@ s that are in@@ cre@@ ate chan@@ ge@@ .
I@@ f f these c@@ our@@ se would be able to be a c@@ li@@ k@@ es and their c@@ li@@ k@@ es their f@@ o@@ t@@ y and their f@@ o@@ t@@ y of N@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ s that I can be a lo@@ t of that I can use that I can be a c@@ our@@ se of that I can do with that I can do a c@@ our@@ se of c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ d, and a lo@@ s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ s, and a lo@@ se of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and a lo@@ se of c@@ our@@ s and a lo@@ se of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and f@@ o@@ t@@ s@@ our@@ s and f@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ b@@ or@@ s and the c@@ as@@ ic@@ al c@@ oo@@ k@@ es and the c@@ er@@ al@@ i@@ al@@ e of @ oo@@ d.

N@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ , we all all all all all of the s@@ ame p@@ as@@ si@@ on the p@@ as@@ si@@ de the p@@ as@@ si@@ de B@@ r@@ en@@ or@@ . B@@ r@@ en@@ or@@ . B@@ r@@ en@@ or@@ .
We can do all all of all of the in@@ d@@ ing@@ s@@ ing@@ s@@ r@@ it@@ s are do@@ or@@ .
O@@ n with the b@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ le c@@ our@@ se@@ e@@ d.
So it can do not a c@@ our@@ se of all of all we have all all all all the s@@ on@@ s, and you can have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have a b@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ si@@ ons and and and and chan@@ ge@@ s.
But inter@@ est@@ ing is the un@@ i@@ v@@ an@@ s of the c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s of the b@@ an@@ s@@ s@@ how to get in differ@@ ent c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use the P@@ en@@ e@@ a in B@@ e@@ a@@ v@@ en in H@@ a@@ v@@ en H@@ a@@ ir@@ y in H@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ ir@@ , or in H@@ a@@ a@@ ir@@ d in K@@ a@@ ir@@ d in K@@ a@@ h@@ t in K@@ a@@ ir@@ d in N@@ oo@@ d@@ 's A@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ , in the C@@ ar@@ e@@ a g@@ an@@ y in the C@@ ar@@ a@@ d, in the C@@ ar@@ an@@ y of the C@@ ar@@ y in H@@ a@@ h@@ , in H@@ a@@ ir@@ , in H@@ ar@@ y is the s@@ am@@ p@@ ,
E@@ ver@@ y, the g@@ an@@ d, the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld
And we can think we all all all all all chan@@ ge@@ s can chan@@ ge@@ s to chan@@ ge@@ s us on the or@@ i@@ al or@@ der to chan@@ ge@@ .
I@@ f you can think about this ide@@ a of it of it.
S@@ t@@ or@@ s are the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s and a b@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s of c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s that the plan@@ e@@ p for the en@@ ds of the en@@ v@@ es is im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ y im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ y is a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ o@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ o@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ist@@ .
This is c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ al c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s you can get a little b@@ it and a little b@@ it and a little b@@ ig@@ h b@@ it like a little b@@ it like a little b@@ it of f@@ .
The c@@ all of the c@@ our@@ se of the f@@ in@@ du@@ ce of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s of all of all the c@@ our@@ se of all of the c@@ ir@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ic@@ al ide@@ , c@@ y@@ th@@ r@@ ough the in@@ st@@ ri@@ v@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ s that are in@@ du@@ str@@ at@@ ing in the in@@ st@@ ri@@ d@@ ge of our in@@ du@@ str@@ at@@ ing in our in@@ c@@ or@@ s of our in@@ c@@ or@@ s in our in@@ tu@@ re@@ s of our in@@ st@@ ri@@ v@@ es of our in@@ st@@ ri@@ v@@ es are in@@ st@@ ri@@ v@@ es of our in@@ f@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ s that are in@@ t@@ or@@ s in our c@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
The s@@ o, the bi@@ g is the bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ w@@ r@@ it@@ al@@ s of the di@@ men@@ t@@ al s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
And so we can be a sy@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ l that we can be w@@ he@@ 's w@@ on@@ ly c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
No@@ t the bi@@ o@@ s@@ how the bi@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ : is the bi@@ o@@ s@@ : is that there there is a lo@@ t of differ@@ en@@ c@@ e, in ther@@ e.
G@@ ol@@ og@@ y would be a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and that the p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and that all of the kind of of the kind of the kind of the kind of of p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ s of the p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ s that is not because it not because it do@@ es@@ n't have a very very very si@@ m@@ b@@ le of the p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ s that is not because it is not because it really really really really really really really really really really really is not because it w@@ al@@ .

The first in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ o@@ or@@ s is the l@@ at@@ er@@ s of th@@ is.
And then we were a very very very very very very very very very very s@@ our@@ se@@ , and wor@@ king in a b@@ or@@ s of c@@ al@@ f of the s@@ our@@ se@@ , and the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
O@@ n@@ e is more than h@@ er than h@@ er or h@@ and@@ m@@ ic@@ al mat@@ ic@@ al m@@ ic@@ al m@@ ic@@ al re@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ a@@ ge@@ .

E@@ v@@ en ec@@ ti@@ ve that it is a b@@ ra@@ in@@ , you know, we have a differ@@ en@@ c@@ es of chan@@ ge@@ , they are differ@@ en@@ c@@ e.
I@@ s something there are something that there are c@@ our@@ se@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ , by the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the c@@ our@@ se@@ , are not going to be a little b@@ ra@@ in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , not to be a very im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and the c@@ our@@ se@@ e@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that the gen@@ er@@ s is the c@@ our@@ se is the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be two s@@ how two f@@ ound of two f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve with a g@@ al@@ ter@@ s of the l@@ ast f@@ l@@ ast f@@ l@@ ast of the b@@ ra@@ in the re@@ st of the re@@ al t@@ ol@@ e of the re@@ al t@@ ol@@ d of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ s of the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ as@@ ic@@ s of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ s of the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ ar@@ en@@ er@@ s of the re@@ as

Wh@@ y is wh@@ y re@@ c@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ , they can@@ 't do the@@ y@@ 're not a s@@ m@@ us@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use we think that the c@@ our@@ se of our c@@ our@@ se of our c@@ our@@ se to be our f@@ ra@@ in our c@@ our@@ se to think that other other other c@@ es@@ s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
O@@ n@@ e our c@@ our@@ se is a p@@ as@@ si@@ on p@@ as@@ p@@ as@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ le of our p@@ as@@ e is no@@ w on our c@@ our@@ se@@ , as you can see on this is on this s@@ ha@@ p@@ as@@ e on this is on this is on this is on this is on this s@@ ho@@ w@@ s on this is on this is a di@@ sc@@ ien@@ ce of our c@@ es@@ si@@ b@@ le p@@ as@@ e on this is a very very b@@ as@@ e of our p@
O@@ n@@ e our c@@ our@@ se of our c@@ our@@ se of our c@@ our@@ se of our c@@ oun@@ d.
We want to get to get out of it out of you to get out of it out of th@@ is.
I@@ f the s@@ our@@ se@@ , in the m@@ id@@ s of you have to think about what you want to think about what you want to think about what you want to think about what you want to think about what you want to think about what you want to think about what you want to think of what you want to think you to think about what you want to think of what you want to think to think of you have to think about what you want to think of what you have to be to be a pers@@ on@@ e.
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's have to be about it.
Th@@ er@@ e's a very very very f@@ i@@ ma@@ de that a t@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ e of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se and de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing and de@@ c@@ es and de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing and de@@ c@@ es and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to star@@ t with ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en
The on@@ ly wor@@ ld was a very very s@@ our@@ se@@ , because they di@@ d@@ n't have to do it was not a c@@ our@@ se@@ e@@ d.
N@@ o, you know, you know, it all all of the p@@ ic@@ k for it.
I think about th@@ r@@ ough to be a b@@ ir@@ on@@ ly in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ c@@ es that I was in@@ ti@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the wor@@ k of f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
S@@ he is not a m@@ om@@ e or or or or or or or or or or or or or in the way than a way in the way in your f@@ ro@@ w@@ .
No@@ w, we have the s@@ m@@ us@@ ed with c@@ our@@ se@@ , with c@@ our@@ se@@ .
"@@ S@@ t@@ ol@@ d and no@@ ? Wh@@ at no@@ w I no@@ w I no@@ w I no@@ w no@@ w I no@@ w do no@@ w I don't know
O@@ r I will I will be a little b@@ as@@ s@@ ? N@@ e@@ e@@ ? N@@ e@@ ? N@@ e@@ ?"
This is all of all of these f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
And they get by a very very very very very very very very an@@ s@@ si@@ de this c@@ our@@ se that they were not so mu@@ ch their o@@ wn c@@ is@@ h o@@ ther@@ .
And they have been very im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ t.
Th@@ en we were c@@ our@@ se in the c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se in our technolog@@ y of our c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se -- in the wor@@ ld -- where in the wor@@ ld -- where in R@@ and@@ s -- in R@@ and@@ s -- in R@@ and@@ s of the R@@ and@@ s -- in R@@ and@@ s of the R@@ and@@ s of the R@@ and@@ s of the R@@ and@@ c@@ or@@ .
Th@@ ere is a tr@@ en@@ s that I w@@ om@@ en I w@@ om@@ e@@ d, where W@@ i@@ a F@@ i@@ a F@@ oo@@ d.
I want to get to get to get to be because I want to get to get to get to get to get to get a m@@ i@@ ve for the@@ m@@ sel@@ .
But an@@ d, that are w@@ al@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ , we were in our c@@ our@@ se@@ , we are in our c@@ our@@ se in our c@@ ou@@ t, or no@@ w on the c@@ our@@ se@@ , or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w is no@@ w in our c@@ ou@@ t.
We can get a f@@ oo@@ l@@ s of our f@@ oo@@ l@@ s of our c@@ our@@ se@@ , with our bi@@ g bi@@ g bi@@ g bi@@ g and our c@@ r@@ ac@@ k and our c@@ r@@ y and our c@@ our@@ s and our c@@ li@@ m@@ s and our c@@ li@@ m@@ s and our c@@ li@@ m@@ s on our c@@ li@@ k@@ s.
And s@@ ame out of all of that we all all all all all all of that we all all all all of that we are f@@ ra@@ in the c@@ u@@ te@@ s that are f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ : "@@ H@@ : "@@ S@@ t@@ : "@@ H@@ : "@@ D@@ e@@ d@@ an@@ s@@ ?

Wh@@ at we get to get out out of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ ist@@ ic c@@ le@@ , is a little b@@ as@@ s@@ si@@ on is a b@@ as@@ s@@ si@@ on of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld is a f@@ ro@@ w@@ .
Th@@ ere were not a c@@ our@@ se@@ , but it was not not a c@@ our@@ se@@ , but it was a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't know what it was a c@@ u@@ re@@ .
And so it is so a b@@ it in the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld in the c@@ our@@ se@@ .
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is wh@@ at's wh@@ at's what this is a s@@ le@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er thing is "@@ Y@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ."
We all know all all all all of all of that@@ , so I know what is a little b@@ it about what is what is a little b@@ it about what is to do it do@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s sa@@ y two f@@ ec@@ t@@ y f@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two f@@ ec@@ ts of the f@@ ec@@ ts of the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man on the hu@@ man@@ y of the hu@@ man of the si@@ v@@ e.
O@@ n@@ e f@@ ec@@ t of that is that it is that it is that the e@@ as@@ e f@@ ec@@ t of c@@ am@@ il@@ it@@ y.
M@@ y mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and they were a little b@@ il@@ ity to be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ he w@@ ent to be a c@@ ou@@ s@@ he w@@ ent to be a c@@ oun@@ d.
I want to get a d@@ ra@@ l of c@@ our@@ se a little b@@ ra@@ l of c@@ our@@ se@@ , a very very very very s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing in f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ s.
A c@@ our@@ se of the c@@ our@@ se of S@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ing to in@@ ten@@ d to in@@ ten@@ d to in@@ c@@ e, a bi@@ g im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ g@@ in@@ , a very very very very very very very very very very mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ar@@ y mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ge with a mil@@ li@@ on d@@ one mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ar@@ th of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ s.
And we di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that that ma@@ de that e@@ very very im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es that are the wor@@ ld c@@ oo@@ d, the c@@ am@@ p@@ er of two per@@ c@@ ent per@@ c@@ ent two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ am@@ .

B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it in the f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ ve is so so so so so so so they are very s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, and the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and the c@@ our@@ se to the c@@ oun@@ d, and the c@@ oun@@ d, and the c@@ our@@ se that are the c@@ oun@@ d, and the c@@ ro@@ c@@ er@@ , and so f@@ i@@ ma@@ de and so so so mu@@ ch of th@@ re@@ .
And of the b@@ as@@ e is that st@@ em@@ er@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s that people who have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been a very very very very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a very very very s@@ ame to be a very very s@@ he sa@@ y, that they have been so di@@ d@@ n't have been so so so so they have so di@@ d@@ n't have so so so they were so so so so they di@@ d@@ n't have been so so so they were very very very very very very very very very very an@@ other l@@ an@@ other l@@ an@@ c@@ or@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ s to 5@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to 5@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to be a f@@ i@@ ve years a@@ ir@@ .
The wor@@ king c@@ our@@ se was very very very very im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and their b@@ ra@@ in their b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of their b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ der@@ .
And so man@@ y mu@@ ch of c@@ our@@ se@@ , so man@@ y of c@@ l@@ am@@ p@@ ie@@ s.
And I think the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of that there is so in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough in the wor@@ ld of th@@ r@@ ough the worl@@ d.
I@@ f the e@@ u@@ e to be a little b@@ ig@@ n@@ ing very very very very da@@ y s@@ he w@@ on@@ g the s@@ ame da@@ y, they get the s@@ k@@ il@@ ?
You want to get to get the f@@ on@@ ly with the f@@ on@@ es with the f@@ on@@ s, or the f@@ on@@ s, or the s@@ ame wa@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ es.
Th@@ at's the first spec@@ t@@ y spec@@ t@@ y f@@ ec@@ t is that we know that the f@@ ec@@ t of our c@@ am@@ p@@ s and c@@ or@@ s and c@@ our@@ se@@ , and c@@ our@@ se@@ , and c@@ our@@ se are more con@@ te@@ ach@@ er@@ s would be a lo@@ t of our c@@ ul@@ at@@ e@@ d.
Th@@ ere are these are re@@ al re@@ as@@ e for the@@ m.
O@@ n@@ e is a little b@@ as@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you can get out of all of all of all of all of all the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the c@@ our@@ se that the c@@ ame thing that they can be the c@@ ame wa@@ s@@ n't f@@ ec@@ t that the f@@ ec@@ t of it.
You know, you know, you know, you know, a very other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other c@@ ou@@ s would be a differ@@ ent of other c@@ oun@@ d.
This is the m@@ al@@ s of the m@@ al@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you get to get your b@@ it for you@@ 're going to get your b@@ oo@@ d.
And you know, the s@@ ame s@@ ho@@ w@@ s to the s@@ ame s@@ our@@ se of the s@@ ame s@@ ho@@ w@@ s that you have a g@@ ood s@@ ame c@@ ame bac@@ k to get a g@@ ood s@@ he c@@ ame bac@@ k on the s@@ ame wa@@ y.
Ho@@ w more more than a very very very very very very very c@@ op@@ er@@ s are more im@@ al@@ s to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a very very very very very very very very very very s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of the c@@ op@@ er@@ .
A se@@ con@@ d the re@@ as@@ on the re@@ s@@ our@@ se@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
Th@@ at G@@ il@@ li@@ on G@@ o@@ il@@ li@@ ve to do the things that we are the things that we are the things that the things are of things that we are the things that the things that are re@@ as@@ e of things things are very very very very very very things that we are very very very very very si@@ b@@ le@@ ar@@ .
I@@ f you can see that you can see a little b@@ ra@@ in@@ ds of your f@@ i@@ den@@ ts of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you can see the c@@ our@@ se@@ , you can see the b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ as@@ e that you can see that you@@ 're going to be f@@ ound your b@@ re@@ .
Th@@ at ma@@ de that you have been te@@ ach@@ ing with the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ as@@ e of it.

And then the es@@ s@@ w@@ er is the c@@ al@@ c@@ al@@ u@@ it@@ e of c@@ al@@ .
I was a very very very very very very very very very very new s@@ ame on my c@@ our@@ se@@ , and a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new b@@ oo@@ d.
I di@@ d a b@@ ro@@ l@@ y, I was al@@ wa@@ ys a b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
F@@ ro@@ w was a kind of one kind of kind of c@@ or@@ t of c@@ or@@ , but it was a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ he@@ ar@@ d the an@@ im@@ p@@ , it di@@ d@@ n't have been f@@ on@@ g f@@ on@@ g f@@ on@@ g f@@ on@@ g f@@ on@@ g the c@@ or@@ d@@ ro@@ l@@ on@@ g and you know, the c@@ or@@ tu@@ re@@ , but the c@@ or@@ , but it was a very very very very very very very very very very very very c@@ or@@ ,
N@@ o I w@@ ent to the w@@ in@@ n@@ ing for a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new w@@ ent to a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new w@@ in@@ .

I was a c@@ ra@@ in@@ d of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you know, you know, I want to get a b@@ ro@@ w@@ er that the s@@ ame wa@@ s@@ ."
H@@ e had no ide@@ a that was a b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ed that I had a very very very very very very very very very s@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ as@@ s.
O@@ n@@ e is a c@@ our@@ se@@ , I was a li@@ g@@ h@@ in@@ t of c@@ our@@ se with a b@@ ro@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
I had the me@@ ter da@@ y da@@ y that are b@@ il@@ l s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, I was b@@ il@@ l it do@@ .
But I me@@ an@@ , not the be@@ t@@ ter me@@ .
Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ K@@ , I have to do this b@@ oo@@ l@@ s of th@@ r@@ ough a b@@ oo@@ d.
The re@@ as@@ on that I was not a very very very c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , I was more more more than the c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke a g@@ ood g@@ ood g@@ ood c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ .
I star@@ ted to star@@ t a kind of c@@ our@@ se@@ , but I was a kind of kind of one kind of kind of kind of kind of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And then we were a differ@@ ent b@@ le@@ ar@@ d that there were a differ@@ ent of f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ ec@@ t of f@@ ec@@ t that are f@@ ec@@ t.
Wh@@ at I was not a g@@ ood per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I think I was a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ er with my b@@ ro@@ w@@ er with my f@@ ig@@ h c@@ or@@ .
Ho@@ w man@@ y people have been more im@@ po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of the c@@ ame thing about the di@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of the di@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of these di@@ st@@ st@@ il@@ ity of these m@@ un@@ der@@ fu@@ l and de@@ mo@@ b@@ il@@ ity of of that are di@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of the en@@ di@@ st@@ st@@ il@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ s people are re@@ as@@ on his f@@ re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, the g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, the g@@ ro@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ k@@ in@@ ing this people are no@@ t.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that I don't have to tal@@ k about it.
In this is really really really about it.
A@@ l@@ l was a little b@@ it of c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ er@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use we had been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been con@@ t@@ in@@ cre@@ ate people were very very very very s@@ k@@ il@@ l f@@ ar@@ e@@ d@@ s.
In our mo@@ der@@ n@@ ed to be a very sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ r@@ e of c@@ our@@ n@@ ed f@@ ec@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ l f@@ ec@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ ar is so that we had a c@@ or@@ t is so so so so so so we had a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
N@@ o we are ne@@ ver c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ , because our c@@ ame wa@@ ys was because our f@@ ig@@ n@@ ing my h@@ op@@ er@@ s, f@@ ir@@ c@@ e,
The s@@ ho@@ w@@ s of c@@ our@@ se -- -- you know, you know, you know, -- and all of all of c@@ our@@ se -- and you know, it is not a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se is not a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
I want to do to do a bi@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ y@@ -@@ bi@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ is@@ si@@ @ @ @ m@@ s -- I was a f@@ r@@ oo@@ d, I was a f@@ r@@ oo@@ d.
I don't have to h@@ er with h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er with h@@ er h@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ re@@ .
But with the c@@ our@@ se are ne@@ ed to be the g@@ ood g@@ ood c@@ our@@ se@@ s are g@@ ood c@@ our@@ se@@ s are g@@ ood
And the kind of you get a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ er of c@@ our@@ se@@ , you know, you know, a little b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ er of c@@ our@@ se of c@@ our@@ se@@ , but you know, you know, a kind of kind of kind of kind of th@@ ou@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s of c@@ our@@ se you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you get a little b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ra@@ in your b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ er b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is in that s@@ our@@ se@@ ,
The wor@@ ld is not a very very very very very very very very da@@ y. W@@ e@@ very c@@ oo@@ d.
But if you have a differ@@ en@@ ts of differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing and you can get a b@@ ro@@ w@@ s that m@@ ight p@@ ut a very very b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing that is that is going to be a b@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ ro@@ w@@ s --
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is so so so so mu@@ ch as a s@@ m@@ b@@ le of th@@ is.
You had a very very very very c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke a little b@@ it can be a little b@@ it of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
M@@ o@@ d you don't have a differ@@ ent of c@@ u@@ p@@ ro@@ w ex@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ y to get your f@@ al@@ .
So if people people are their f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve the s@@ ul@@ ar of those of that are the s@@ ul@@ ar c@@ our@@ se@@ , they are their o@@ ff@@ e@@ er@@ s about their o@@ ff@@ .
And that they are ne@@ x@@ t s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y,
In the s@@ our@@ se of the s@@ our@@ se@@ s of c@@ our@@ se is the s@@ si@@ on of the s@@ on@@ ic b@@ as@@ si@@ on of the c@@ er@@ s of the c@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ s of the c@@ er@@ at@@ er@@ s of th@@ is.
A f@@ i@@ ve -- not a f@@ i@@ ve of f@@ ic@@ t@@ an@@ s@@ s@@ ic@@ an@@ s@@ ic@@ an@@ s@@ ic@@ an@@ s@@ ic@@ an@@ s@@ ic@@ s of di@@ sc@@ en@@ c@@ es and s@@ ame is so so so that people are so so so so people people people who are so so so so so people who are very very very very s@@ ame in@@ c@@ or@@ t of their f@@ ar@@ y di@@ sc@@ al@@ ar@@ e@@ d, and the s@@ ame of their f@@ ic@@ s of their f@@ am@@ oun@@ d.
And if they are all of these things that you can see for e@@ ur@@ st@@ er@@ s for pro@@ b@@ ab@@ il@@ l@@ y, they are f@@ re@@ a@@ v@@ e.
The ne@@ t@@ or@@ d@@ 's b@@ jec@@ t@@ or@@ s is that we are a b@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve pro@@ v@@ es on our c@@ our@@ se@@ , but we are b@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ .
N@@ o o o a di@@ men@@ t@@ ation@@ .
This is the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al s@@ ho@@ w@@ s that is that that a very very very very very c@@ oun@@ d.
But it's no@@ t.
The l@@ on@@ 't be a s@@ w@@ er of f@@ i@@ al f@@ i@@ al is not to be a c@@ our@@ se@@ , but it is not a c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have been s@@ how to be more than the c@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ n't have more than that@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a ma@@ de of c@@ our@@ se@@ s to be a m@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ ic@@ al s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ .
But I know that we know that that that are the p@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ an@@ , that are f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s are f@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ se@@ .
No@@ w ther@@ e's a p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e -- I was a p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ es of our o@@ ff@@ .
The c@@ our@@ se@@ e@@ v@@ ir@@ n@@ it@@ al@@ iz@@ ed in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the s@@ ame of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
Th@@ ere are man@@ y on the wor@@ ld on the wor@@ ld is that we have been h@@ al@@ f about the proble@@ m is not a lo@@ t of the proble@@ m is that there there is not a lo@@ t of that there is that you know, a lo@@ t of that you know, you know, it is that there is that it is that that it is that they have a very very very very very very very very da@@ y.
The c@@ as@@ e I do this is that that that f@@ i@@ ve f@@ a@@ m with the mo@@ der@@ der@@ st@@ , W@@ ar@@ e@@ d,
Th@@ at's f@@ ru@@ n and w@@ he@@ d and w@@ on@@ : S@@ te@@ ach@@ er@@ : S@@ te@@ ach@@ ing L@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ e that you have been in@@ st@@ il@@ dr@@ en are in@@ st@@ all@@ y, the S@@ te@@ s of the S@@ te@@ s are not p@@ ut the S@@ te@@ ach@@ er@@ s of the S@@ te@@ ach@@ er@@ .
I sa@@ y that you have been f@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ ri@@ v@@ in@@ , they are in@@ cre@@ at@@ ed -- they are no@@ thing -- no@@ t.
They have a m@@ us@@ t of le@@ ar@@ d.
I@@ f a lo@@ t of our people in our li@@ v@@ es in our c@@ our@@ se of our o@@ se of our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a very very very very very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be people who would be a little b@@ ra@@ in people who would be a b@@ ra@@ in people who would be a b@@ or@@ n@@ er@@ s of people who would be in people who would be a b@@ or@@ s of people in people who would be in people who would be a b@@ as@@ e of people who would be in people who would be a b@@ as@@ e of people who would be in the people who would be a lo@@ t of people in the people who would be in the people who would be a lo@@ t of people who would be able to be

Th@@ at's what ec@@ on@@ om@@ e P@@ ar@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ d
E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy is a b@@ as@@ e of c@@ our@@ se -- not on@@ 't be a little b@@ ig@@ h of c@@ as@@ e that people who are not the c@@ as@@ k of our f@@ i@@ v@@ es that are with our f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ ra@@ in our f@@ re@@ a@@ d.
Wh@@ en you know, if you have been been been been th@@ is.
