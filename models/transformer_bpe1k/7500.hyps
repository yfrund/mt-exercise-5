Forig year, I seen this two dia's seen that the last years, that the last depict of the last three million years of the last 10 percent of the U.S. S. with 400-S, with 40-cromber cromes.
But this represent of this specific problem because it didn't the animagine of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem because it's not the dicate.
The ice is the North of the North pool is in the cape of the click of our global system.
It looks in the winter and crips in the sky.
And the next animagine I seen a version of what the last 25 years of what happened to 25 years of what happened to happened to 25 years of what happened to happened to 25 years of what happened to be a flating of what happened to show.
The permanence is clearning in rood.
As you see the sically, it looks at the dark bark bark bark
And that's the years, the years, the year times the winter.
And the criples in the smp in the simply in the simply in the souple of the smp of the small.
And so the named of the permanence or ancestor, is balmost like blood is like blood as blood is the body skilled shows here.
In 25 years is the from this is the way of this is going to this this.
And that's a problem because the problem because the North of the North Issaid, the North Issay, and there's a very big hold of course of capitity.
Fore country to the totalal reverse in the atmosphere, which would be sfive to the atmosphere, which we can put it the encountry and if we can be call the understanding of the atmospite of the atmospite of the atmosphere.
In some undipance in Alaska borrels in Alaska borreligion of the water.
And African winter of Prophessor Katey Walter of University with a different of Alaska different to a different to a different to a different uneds.
What is OK. The question is right or while we will be able to be be.
And a reason is that this enormous break of break country from the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of reason for the normous of the normous of breason for that.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water than ever is the water than ever greater than ever greater than ever greater than ever greater than ever greater than ever greater than ever greater than ever before the water than ever before the water than ever before the waters.
This is the Kangerlusual suast-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea crite of smell because it landyes is the place where it is the place where the seatts.
These stroms need to be fluence.
On the other side of the planet, on the South pool, the biggest is the biggest is the biggest of the Earth.
And Africans cortes are scientists scientists now is now a negative continent of the encircles.
Meer specific is in the ice of the South pool of the South pool of the South pool waters with some waters another waters.
The whole continent of sources for sources of showing the country.
In the Himalaya, the Himalaya, the last soccle, there are now new mericans that is now a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population of the world's drop of the world's tools of that smel.
In the Andes, this glass of dink water for this city.
Now there are more stromes.
But when they set it is also wish the dreams of water.
In California, there was a very, a very, a reducation of 40 percent in the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reserves in the water reserves of the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the waterres.
And as you could be couldn't exceptions of the predictions of it.
This world's world's global social ship to a dramatical styce.
And the number of natural world, is citing with a incredible and never seen the world,
For more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the last 75 years.
This pattern is fully following in.
If you look at the better of a historical context than you can see what happening.
In the last five years of the last year we have 70 million ton of CO2 hours --
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Kelook at the Stille of the Stillele, from America, west, from America, west, and at the Indian inent, and to the Indian inent, there is a drager of stric drawhether in the ocean.
The only big thing is the only basically the earth, which is basically designs for 20 percent of phossil brans of phossil brans of the earths of fossil brans of the earth,
One is a problem, and cool is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two grand-stoters, sames.
And there was a pretty more still to build a lot of more still centrales to build a lot of more still cool.
But we see a metle.
This is the cities of cools that the building blocal cition in the last years, and where big alternative percent and where the last alternative alternative before.
There is a political striple of the country.
The citencool, and ological gave inst of cition dollars of dollars to promots, which is a testing cool for promots, which is a testing city.
And that imagine me to think about something about something about this.
Rond the core was in Tennesse, in Tennesse, inved, unvement in Tennessard labillion of money.
You have the probably in the new news in the new news in the new news in the new news in the new news in the new news.
This is the only last one na last last falstrict in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adverties of the cities, the Kerst of the Kerst was death.

Here's a big part of the citencycool in West Virginia of this.
The great least mber of the country is the great biggest basically Coal.
Video: Don Blancal clearning me to be Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, Harry Red, they don't know about where they don't know about where they don't know about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Kliance for Klimate two campaigns on told on told to told the told of the campaign.
This is a piece of a piece of of this.
And so "BBy COALergy, we see the climate change as a series of change for our business.
And that's the reason why the most important of the most important of the value of the value of the light of the light of the value of the valuility of valuility of the valuility of the value of the value of city.
Feit is, steage is not show is not show of the right now is not sky.
We find that it's son -- and it's certainly still eyet it is still eyes.
So, you don't have a long change about climate change.
Let me be about us.
Video: Acteur: Schonice cool, you have a lot of about heard.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern cititypermodernital.
Fantastic stic! The machines best wear.
But that's the sound of sound of scales technology.
One the fact that the fact that the burning of cities, one of the most important thing of the earth of the earth is change the earth is change the skly, the skly, which is all of the skly.
Look at running around the scales of cools of the day.
Al Gore: Eindemply put the positive alternative to our economic challenges and that are alternative university.
Video: Stem: America version in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national veility, the climate crisis.
The red sources of all of these things is our dependent of phossil brands of phosprite and inmporated ology and inmported olic.
Now there is a durful, new solution to be a fired to be this.
Fire America of America of crote electricity in 10 years.
A plan to get America of America cition that our firee of the earth of the earth of the earth generate.
And then a solution of solution that are enough to solve our problems to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontded to hold.
Al Gore: And the last cated.
Video: Stem: The thing is to give America currenergy to give America of energy.
And one of the snelst ways to make a last ways to our early dependence of oldependence of oldependence.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Neously, 2: Neage to create good basically certainly cluding of the bits of the bits of the bits of the basically

Al Gore: There is a old African to speakil, "If you want to be a sick too to everything you.
If you want to go to far away to say,
We should be far and far and set of course.
Thank you very much.
And I was a last year, I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I call of the right back with a hand-hand-high-clear business.
So I am I am is not only the LHC is not the last scientific scientific experiment in the scientific experiment in the trees of the trees of the tremenment.
It has to be the stances of the stances that are billion less than a billion of billion of billion to we've started to 100 million times a billion time.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine onder Geneage faile.
We took photographs of that leave Big Big Bangs bininess, and this is the ATLATLATLATLATLATLAATLATLAATLATLATLATLAATLAATAs in diameter.
Spectacular photographphoshotographphone in the scale.
On 10 september for the machine years, we stop the machine for the machine for the machine for the first city.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That is a factory for a factory in the control.
It's a picture of the first particlected of the first particular cited the LHC gong the HC C, and with a piece of the LHC, which is truth, by the detector of the tector of the textor of the tector of the first tector of the first dectory of the first particular of the HC,
Mothers other words, when we saw at 10 September fix mber fired that the machine works, which is a huge expection.
I don't know if this the greatest best of the greatest right or this, or does to Google and saw it was so going to be the Internetpage.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which we had a problem with this gold.
And that they were sound 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of the machine on volution.
The engineers under you say, "Not true. It is true. It is too small of small of drappear."
They can do that because they can do that because they are doing on all the last last last last last temperature of temperature lissuperature of the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last ast last last last last last ast ast last last last last last last ast last ast last last last last last last leavage of the last lass.
So on might between the gard between between the garts, that can be able to be between between strood.
In one of the basically increase between the nects in the LHC, zat a constructiful.
And then by the dreamed thously something that was inside of each obviousands that 13 thousands of thousands.
This was the results.
And this is another indrugs as you realized that magnets more than 20 ton that magnets more than 20 percents.
We described about 50 magnets.
We had to do them from them, what we did do.
We all have flated them.
Now they are back to we.
Eind might be the LHC weather intact.
We will expectly to be criting and we expect to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be what the building the universe of the universes of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, which is the debate of scientific soccurrency of scientific research. It's making a bit of scientific research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard so hard to be so we far to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the HC.
I was the last words on the last words of the English scientists of the value of the value of the value of the value of his learning experiments of his learning Michael Faraday, this is so told to the couly, "Nangarday, which is that our famous our cupplay of the last designs that we are not be able to be designated that our citioned that we are fast."
Thank you very much.
I would start to start with you with you to ask to to your kids to care to call of children you speaking with block with block you.
And then you discover how you to move to the ground, they pick and business, you know, you know, you can get the last solution of space and showing with the criting of space relations.
And Rutell you you can see is because with the world to understand of the world.
If a information, as a inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samples with my advisition -- samples with my advisithi -- I started to asking me -- I started to ask to questions, I started to asking a computer of musical figure as a of musical found as a smelepephital fenerginformation and a country to be a firee to the skilities that we can be able to be information with a citing cital fissue to shows of the cature to ship of cature of fities of fits of fital fical fical five bital fulation of fical fical fite fities -- -- -- -- and ship of phy-ber to be able
and can we have to be able to be able to be this?
This is question of us as we decided that we decided to slock a answered by building the Siftables.
Cort samental is a Siftly a Siftly interactive computer back to a cooks.
They can be able to be set with the hand they can be able to put them to move their movement and they free a screen and they free a screading and contact.
And the nuclear is physical handled like block of the block of the clock of the fired of the fire.
For example of the Siftables a new ecosystem for the ways for the ways of digital information.
And this is that this hold average of physical difference of the movement of their movement moving of movements, and even of the way we move them to move them and showing new and new and leave new and new and new and new and designing new and designing new and designing new and design the way we design of the way we have a more interacts.
I started to start with some of some example.
This Siftly is instice to tell a video to set a filled by cells and others and others to speaks and others and others to speaks.
These interactive portraits are of eactive portraits of each other.
Indidid each other, they will be able to each other.
And if they are being them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be enuwaits and can be able to be the enuwaits of it.
And then they feeling and they movement and hell.
We realized alize that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction, the us, as it was a bary of the interaction, as it was a small of the small of a small of the flast as it was a flat.
In this example of examples of Siftables for the skills for and I can use them to go to small in a leg, where they are become to small of the small of the sks.
If we have been drevies, we have a terue.
There are some cappe of cappe for the education, pretty play spely with tools and logica where we are speak the capitities that we want to show to show to sults the results of the results of the sults of the results of possibilities of course.
And here, I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci reprogrammmits of a simply programs.
Here's a spelt that is a spelt between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you in everybody wanted to get a lot of letters on each Siftable, and sense of the words in a words.
Now, about 30 seconds of seconds the regulls and different ent closing a new series of course.
Thank you.
And this is some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the cluding of the slowed to try and try to make a fourth of this.
They were really really really really really wear.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people are almost people almost inventions of the most interesting of the most interesting things that people needed.
All of what you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they should do you do what they should do you do to do that.
Here's some other people to the single other people to the test.
That's our youngst basically regularly regular.
And it looks like this.
For him was just just blocklasses.
Here's a interactive scildry shows to be a interactive screadd.
We wanted to be a platform for the larms of tool.
This is Felix that demonstreate.
He can brings new capacross the Sifts, by the Siftly the Sift-caraker of the table.
Here's the son he son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the son the right com.
Video: The seon comes from the son comes from it.
David Merrill: No has a tractor in the scene brown.
Video: The oranclearning tractor.
God da!
And by the shape of Siftables and the name places of Siftly the caracross of the carags -- Dideo: Well,
DM: And so his own story telling.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open of course.
and he decision and he decisid.
Video: The cates flassong.
DM: The last example of the last today is a synthesizer and Is a synthesizer and live to developed that we have a sound, where we have a sound, as the lead, as the lead, based as the lead, based and based and based the based and based today.
One has been a four different variations where you can use to be able to do you coose you can use to use it.
These sound sound Siftables in Siftables injected.
You put a sound last cutly in the pattern of Siftly Siftly cerbasically infects as reversal effects as reversal and filter.
They are being a sound sound and capitute.
And fless the alives like tempo and folum that are pattern to the whole pattern of the whole pattern.
Let's look at least we look at it.
Video: DM: DM: We're started with a leave in two Siftables, to a first patroon, to a first patroclear by a extra lot of extra lead.
Now I was the basline of the basline is the basic.
Video: DM: Nu food I say what slagh.
Video: That is I copped the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can call the same block of the smeling of the small of the smelectly block of the smely of the smeling of the smeling of the smeling of the sks.
Video: DM: Nu copple I was the filter for what expressy.
Video: DM: I can reput it pattern to the playing.
So I don't have anam everything to plann, but I can improvisers, it very longer and corter like I want.
And with the fly, the dimmmespecially by the folum Sifts.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of new people, to the new people, of new people, which are better interfaces that are better to the way our brain and body work and light of the brain and work and work and work and work and work and work to the way to the brains of new people.
And I was today I had the time to show you a new element in this designed to single you with some of a single motions that we are singly in the lable.
And the thought I want to talk about the core is that this bad to a very new generation to a very new generation with the Interacters for the Interacters to our world with digital media, which we wanted to our world to our world as we wanted to be able to our world to our world to our world is going to go to our world to our world to our world is going to be able to
I do thank you from hear.
I look at the way to talk to to talk to talk to you all and talk to talk to to talk to to to call and I look at to talk to you all and to talk to you all and I went to talk to to to to cate.
I write write am write am I am write am write am write awrity.
Book, but also much more than data lot more than data.
My whole life I am to be long and I don't think that ever will be change and I don't think that ever change to change it.
And then then there is a longs something really happened in my life and career and career with my relationship with my relationship with my work operate.
And the began with a book that I wrote unless I wrote a memmoire: "Ets, Biddle, Bidd," that is very international work about the whole work about the world, and a International destribuilt of the world.
And the so, that people are now to be able to be able to be call of the booms of called I mean.
Well, you know, where -- coming down the way --
People come to me and ask to me and ask you to me that you can't take that you can't be succcessarence of the succcess?
Now, you don't you to be able to be live to be bang the book, but never set a book more of where people are going to be able to be able to be the people to be lopen?
Now, you don't have to be bang there?"
Every hundred stristed you.
Now, of course, that would be very much of the bremember that I was 20 years ago, I was a teener -- if I was told to be a teach.
People said, "Ben you don't have never succcessary that you never get count?
Don't you to be able to be able to representation by sing?
Now, you don't you to be live to this work on this work is something that there is something that there is something from point and you can get it to the public brothers with your broke bits of broke bit?"
And, one in that streking.
And in the cors is my answered on that questions of this questions of this, "Yeah.
Yeah, I'm bang for all of those things that are being things that are being to be enough.
Always always all of it.
But I also am for a lot of other things that you don't know for all of other things for all of other things for all of other things for all of other things for all of other things for everything for everything for all of other things for all of other things that bangls.
For seeing seeing example, and other engineering things.
But what is being is writing to write myself the last time that are fire.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is being to be a bang for the work for the work for the way to she sent to their earth of the earth of the Earth
What is so such a burn of creative processing us to create the effects of the effects of the global stately of the gality, something like to be the way of the way of the world.
Now, my father. He was skill engineering engineering that there was not remember in the 40 years who was happened to him it has not a lot of him for way.
And so of "Yohn, how is the chemblockay.
Now, so it was not about showing song --
Om to be able to be able to be soil engineers have not the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation depressive alcolists and for the sholists and be.
Scheaps that have been so kind of reputation.
Not only another creative people have creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputting instability.
Look at the grimp of the grimp of the most magnifical creative coming to the 200th century.
And then still you know, flong, fly, by own to do it.
And even though the same place of the skilled of their gave cors.
In the last interview for his dread of the last interview Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailers is a piece of mif.
And that's what to say about your livship of life.
But of this kind of expactly we don't look at it.
We all have been all of the fither and have the sky of the cepted.
The same thing is that create creativity is creativity uncupon is increating and that is a artists and that is a artists to existencount of entist.
And that's why I want to ask everybody here to ask you to ask with that idea of life of life life of life liv?
Do you have that OK?
Now I think about it is a good about nase, I think about it is not a pretty of though.
I think it wearing the wear.
And also another thing is easions.
I wouldn't see that this eught of this.
We can creative creative better a lot of better to live to live.
I know that it was for me, in my situation, in my situation, broadd to be to be to live.
And seen the fase where my career in my career in my career is now the fase of the fase of the fase where my career in my career in my career where my career in my career in my career in my career rengine.
And then I am I'm going to be young, amper fired years.
I can be able to be four decades of decades in the decades of work.
And this is probably probably what I will be publiceer by the outside world, as it work as it was just successful book.
We are with friends of under under to friends you know it to be able to be slowing my greatest success, my greatest success,
Jig, what a idea!
If you think about it is so think, you know, you know, you know, the right to the drive to the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drive of the drange.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love of love with the work of the work of locks.
And the question is: "Hoooo?"
Now, long navailable to the conclusion to be a psychological scribeing as I can described a psychological scribes in the process in process in the process in the process of inbuilt in the process of the clong of the conclusion in the clong of the conclong of the conclusion in the c
I have to create a filed a filed of create stand create between mificians between the responds for the response to the reactions of the futures.
I have the last year I went to do that.
I am in history in history in other history in other depended to see or others to see or otherthers a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of creative percent to help the creative percent of the creative complications of the
My search of the old of the old of the Greeks and Romeined.
Let last because it's a long and increating story.
In the time of the old of the old of the old of people who didn't have to be creativity of people didn't have to be able to be able to be so.
Men I believed that creativity creativity of a lot of reverse of a reverse of place to the humans of the humans of reasons.
The Greeks call these behold call of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And then Socrates believed that he was a demp that he was a demp of the ways of influence.
The Romeins had a kind of typical idea.
And so it called a called creative creative creative creative creative a "genideny called a genidence.
The grapy is that the Romeins with a genion is not a bit of pience charters of charters of charters of characters of the clears of the cience of pience of the right is a genion is that the Romeineins of clearter room.
In their political good entitugical good entitles that are opped in the mure of the ately of the atelus.
A little bit like Dobviby the house of the currence.
If the artists of the work of the genion of genious assistance.
And the sight-shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's precisions that I had the first about the psychological described the results of your work.
Everybody whatever in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The artisted was so in screen to be able to be a lot of narcism.
If you work bread, you know, you wouldn't just the every eater of the way,
Everybody is a wish that a unseverse.
Well, you know, you work to you, then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Everybody is that you have a couldn't have a fun.
Lange time is that was set how in the Westen creativity was protected to protected
And then the Renaissance, and everything is change.
There is a very new ideas, the individual humans is the middle of the universe of the universe of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and clear the ft of the universe, and the follows of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the funiverse of the universe of the mysteriverse of the uni
And then a space for mystical wearing from the good of the global world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity creativity of the individual filleft.
And for the first time in history in history about artists artists and that they were not a genion and not she didn't have a genion and not a genion that they had a genious of history.
I have to say that I have to find that I think a big fire.
Om one person is one person is one engindividual individual she save it or she saved the ship of the euwonderful mysterious of everything is that is to creative and creative the famous of the frather than that is something to a frather a frather than a frather than answer.
or you can ask somebody question in the slike.
Egood become and slows to go and to gigantic proporties and there are instances of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations and put picians and privied to prestations and there's incures and before ces and early pections of the gigantial proports.
And I think this drug 500 years artists capot 500 years artists capot has made it.
If that is so I think that is the question is the question is the question is what us, "What number of us, and I think that is the question.
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a older of the relationship of the relationship between the cumysterious?
Maybe not going to be it.
Well, light we can have 500 years rational humanism not unclear in a 18 minutts.
With probably small of the audience of scientists that early have been about the idea that electly fires of the idea of what with some factors of artists and the work of artists and the work of artists of the heads of the heads of the heaves of the fify of the idea that is the work of the fififuls of the
It seems to get me you all of that.
And I ask it to me it me me to show me it it me.
Why not?
Why would we didn't have to be follow?
And the sky, so many hold as any other ververal corporate of the total major major corits that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who are going to create create create -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know, it is always always have been been always drown.
And that sometimes the early paranormal of the birely of it.
I have the wish I have the great American directly Ruth Stone Stone ches Ruth Stone ches Ruth Stone chertains of American difficult of American difficult of American difficult of the wish clows of the clownonlangs of the wisononlanguage.
They're close in the nextion. Her lives all of scribes they write anyway.
And she told me about her you're on the plating of Virginia.
Somes, if they were field to the field of the work of the closing she was a closing close of the longs of the longs of the longs of the longs of the longs of the field of the close of the long,
It was, as said it said a big golf came aircummic.
And one of close golfed than the country to her her her to her her the country.
And she feeling that the ground, he started to show to show to show that her on that her on that her on that her life for her life.
They went to sent to set house, and they had to set it as set as set as showing and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper than the caper and paper than sent to set and paper and paper than caper and paper than sent than the clowing and sight and she went to set to set and then
When the closing by her her her was her her her engain, we could have a close to write the sks.
Sometimes they didn't set enough.
Then and ring and ring and right not.
And in the sults of sot she went by her her shed by her words on the many words -- to another directly -- to another dichter.
And then you find the beautiful of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are almost mistic.
And then she was in the house in souple and paper and schools and schools by her her through her through her she's she's in her her of home.
Juist that moment had a poty than a potty.
And with her other hand, so tell me she told me she close the close of the air.
And they put it in the closing and then it back in her body in her body back in her body to she write the opscread.
In those closing closing the closing of paper in the closing of paper in the capiper of paper follow.
And then I heard that hords, I thought -- what I was fired my creative process to be my creative process to cook!
And so my creative process of not! I'm not a medium!
I am a mile, who day on the same time, which is the same time, and same time, and swish and trans and trans and trans down.
But even in that day of the day of the days, I had so simply of the experience of the experience of the experience.
You know, you can also know the myself, that there are creative ideas that there is creative in your borrels from a bron that you can can be increative to be increative to be increative to be increative in.
What is that burn?
How can we use it usion without of th?
One a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example of this is musicians to be musicians Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I was a few years ago,
We had the hided of this.
And in fact, in fact, a big, part of his life is the universe of the crath of the crath of the corits that are trying to get all the unexpensive impults that are creative in.
And the years, the 1ars was Tom what the same rustic.

And as he was so resh there's so reason he was a fragmental odie.
And the clearning him, like inspiration that we've got failable to unfailable to unground.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to be the fasth.
But it wouldn't walone.
He had no paper not pies, no paper in the right now in face.
And the great spanced spannam of him: "I went from the melowho crates the melowho is the result of the eught back to put it back to the eught of the familious of the cition of him and then then
I don't am good enough, I can't do it it doesn't s."
He went doesn't real in panic, but he stopped that help of the whole process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and said, "Sorry horry hand-hand-hand-hand-s?"
"Do you really know that I can show a lot of swrite of write that I can show to show you a lot of sk?
If you want to get that this lowing is you need to be later, you have to do it as I well.
Nobody else than anybody else are fall.
And then the lonard of Leonard Cohen." And from that moment of the process of the process of different.
The work is the same thing is the same dark of the dark of dark of dark under.
But the sware spanning that creative process in him in him in him in him of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the genious of the gen

I wish I wish from my manuscrips and I went to a leave to a leage of the camer.
And I said hardop: "Listerer dopers, we know everything that if this book, it's not just by mile, then comes by myself by myself by myself by myself.
You can see that I have all in the stop in what I have in me in me.

And if you have to find that it better can, you have to do you your business.
Snap you e? Do you don't you get that, you're not,

OK, in the notal called that is a lot of course, you know, I was just to cancere."

That was always sky, because the dances were followed professionals.
But sometime, some of some echer is something business.
And one of those dances was transcendent.
You know what I know what I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can also have to seen a performer.
It was as as as as as as as as as as as as the dances of staps.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have the only simply of these projects, about the human genome of these projects, and what that can meaning the human genome.
We started to be a new point of point, we were the biology to the biology of the biology of the biology of the biology to a new fase in the biology and synthetics and synthetics and syntissue of life.
So we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is something that is something that I think of biologists have trying to understand the different nives on different nives on different nive.
We have different bences protected to leave the back to leave leave to leave leave components.
We are now 20 years at the digitalization.
And then we have the human genome sequenced, it was from the analog world, the digital world, to the digital world, to the digital world.
Now, we try to ask you, can we live to ask new life of life creating new life universe?
This is the maps of a little organism. Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the small, which can be humans in a laboratorium.
And we have trying to look at a nice small of small of smaller genome.
We can take in the orth of hundred generate of the 500 or so that we are be.
But if we look at the metabolical currates that relative relative to the unction.
OK, this is simplicat.
But when we look at all the genes of the genes that we can look at the ones of the invitue of the invitue of the lived cell of cell lived cell of cell live.
We decided to be why the only route proposed to be this chromospite to syntheticipictures so that we could couple the components to questions to ask the most of the most fundamental questions of the most frather questions of the most frather questions of the most frather of the most fundaments.
And so we started with questions with questions of the chromos?"
Staken the chemistry the chemistry moleculate to make it never seen never seen never seen ever seen end?
And, if we can do that, you can do a chromosphere?
A chromoslect is a piece of chemical inerts material inerts material.
So, our tempo of the digitalization of life is the faster of life is on exponential as show.
Our mosting to call the genetic code to write the genetic country to slower the genome.
And our last point would be the last point on a exponential curve.
We are started to start over 15 years ago.
There were a number of closing for a bio-ethical ethical ethical tsent of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthrough of DNA very hard to be hard to be a lot of DNA very hard to be a lot of DNA very hard to do that.
There are tiends of months of monits in the world, who small of DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in lengineer, and it's a decided to 50 percent of the world, and how long, how longs the father, how to be a four bit more four there.
So we had to make a new method for the soccurrates of these little small of these little small of the corriging of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi 174.
That's a little virus of fours that bacteria of small of this.
We developing the pieces of the foltcorrectiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontiontions.
and had a DNA-moleculecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spanning part of the bacteria of piece of chemical stoptic stoptic stopts, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and firl the bacteria of corress.
The viral particles were called the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and the E.
I was indicutly in the olician, and I said that they said that they said that they said that they said to good snapts.
They're slowing more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation in which is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of big time.
We wanted to built the full of bacterial chromoslecture.
And that's more 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassetts, so that we could build the cassetts, so we cassetts.
and to understand what the dress of the same components of a lived cell of a live.
The design is crucial information in the computer information in the computer than you should be accurazy accuraision.
And then we standing this genome of genome in 1995 was the standard standard of the standard of 10,000 baseparts.
And then we found the way, we found after 30 following 30 following the wasn't used in the wasn't used in city, it was not started to star.
One part of the designs of the designs of stuffs that 50 letters of the other country to do with all the other country to built the smaller sub-smaller sub-small of the smaller of small of the small of the designs of the designs of the designs of the designs of the designers to build to built of the de
We designed to designed with the engine.
Maybe you have a last sounds, you have water in stop.
Beause dit: we have a fourth genetic ccode: A, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of the letters for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a side of clearning for each office for each ozyes.
So we can use the genetical code to write words to write words of course,
And, we have to be a mimagin.
Some of course that there were no flongs that there were no global directs.
We have this pieces so designed that we can decided to enzymes.
There are enzyms that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to do with crating with crating with skes that five to 7,000 letters that five and you have to 7,000 letters and you have to 7,000 tter, to 724,000 tter, to 72.0.
In each cum cits we came to be a survive of these stuff, so we could couldn't have a process that we could create a process that is -- that is going to be a process -- that will be so.
We try to try to take the point of automatic.
So this is a basketbasketbasketbasketbasketbasketbal.
And then we have the fired to the great of the bases -- more than 10,000 bases -- then they don't have to easy more in E.
And that is the expensive of the modern of modern modern of modern modern of modern modern biology.
And we do to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists recombination, that is used by the biology to be DNA to repart of the biology to sames.
Here's a example of example of this.
There's a organism cus to Deinocococococococococcus to sodurans to so.
And that's just in the bottop in the bottop of chromosphere.
12 ot 24 hours later later in elecially as it was as a certainly as it was first time it was first time it was first time it was first time it was first time it was first again.
There are thousands of organisms that can be thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms of organisms that are thousands of thousands of organisms of organisms of organisms of organism
These organisms can fully populated to be a lot of coogs.
They can live.
I know that there is absolutely that there is live in space that can be able to be able to be able to be a new again, a new amay be envied.
NASA has tricans long show that there is a lot of of of there, there's a lot of of of there, there's there.
Here's a drive microphone of moleculecul that we have made with this processing with this processing with this processing with the right designs of the skes of the stuff.
And it's a orgs for that they car automatical society.
This is not electronen-microscopphotograph; this is a microscope.
It's so a big moleculeculeculeculeculecule.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of sources.
This is the publication that we including including the publication of the publication that we including including including the publissues.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest moleculeculeculecule, with a clearning structure.
The moleculecuulated is more 300 million of 300 million of
And if we would be distances with a 10-points of points letter, you needed the genetics of the cition of the corational code ade again.
So how we started a chromosphere? How do we activers we cat?
And a frus is a frus of equalready easy.
And a bacteria is a lot of increating increating the bacteria is a lot of increating increating a lot of increating increating.
It's also simpler if you put ineukaryots, like as you get the celkers and down and down and doing a other in, and that is what you knows and that is what you know.
And the bacterious of the bacterious of the chromospling in the cell of the cell of the cell transplanlanguage transplantial transplantial transpling to a cell to a differents.
We have a chromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromoss.
These are about so about so of each other, as people and people and mouth.
We food, we food, so that we could be so that we could be able to be so we could be count to be away.
We have the sanceither with enzyms to make all the early piece.
It was free to be singing this in the cell of cell -- and you will be able to be the very cell of cell fired graphical imagins -- new chromosophic.
We thought it was to develop to be about to develop the process of what we trying to developing it out of the process of developing of develop.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all of the kinds of of chromosed chromospite or a thousands of the thousands of thousands of the sands of the kind of of sands in one of the kin.
People that are evolution evolution as as as as as as a lot of change change that have not a lot of biology meet.
There are enzyms that are restriction-enzymess, they are enough DNA verse.
The chromosly that in the cell has not eed.
The cell -- the chromosly that we stopped -- well, the chromos;
It was the same out, and it was the other chromosphere, and it was the other chromosphere, and why we had a free with the new chromosing with the new chromosing with the new chromoses.
He was solived to the genes we had stop.
And in very cort time in very cort times all the corious of the soff of the soff of the new software in the new software in the corits that we had been software in the cell of the corition of the corportunate.
All of the skilled of the burning of the genetic code -- when we had the genetic code in which was changed.
And this is a clines as genomicalchemician, but we are in the software in the software DNA, to change things to change things to change things to change things to change things.
Now, I have all the first time that this is not a skill of the Camburning -- this is prettbillion years ago, and I have a new version years again, and I have a new version of the Cambring of the Camburning of the Camburning of the Cambased where we have to be a new kinds of the corital designal to this is that we maybe be red to be be be be remember, where the country of the cital designal to this kind of the cordrowing of the cital to design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's free is the free is the free if you look at what it is neclear.
We go to take a billion of ses-half billion of billion people's coming the next of the next of the next 40 years.
Om in my context in my context bors in 1946.
Now there are three people on this planets.
every of us that in 1946, in 1946; biness.
We have to food with food with the food with the songer of water, medicine water, free for the sessary.
And that's becoming to do that for next to do that.
We use five billion ton tones, more than 30 billion of five five five of oil.
That's 100 milos fess.
When we have biological processing biological process or whether to be a huge process to be a huge of challenge that is a huge challenge.
And then of course, of course, of the stand that is really coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really come.
And for all of our world's descrips we have a database with undernecessary 20 million gents, and I would see as the future.
The electronical industry had a lot of different components, and look at the diversity of components, and look at the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the anectronics.
We are prettent except by a biological reality and our our expication.
We now have technique to do the snell synthesemethods to do so called the combination-genomics."
Now we have the possibility to build a million chrobots that a million chromosomes a day.
If you work on the deal of 20 million different genes or protect processing to deal to make octack octanial or medictions, new vaccins, we can do with a little team of team to be a little bit of the last 20 years, we can do more molecular to the 20 years.
And it's just standard a standard ection.
We can fires for living for life, chemical production, fible production, faccinproduction, so forth.
This is a screen of maphone of what eching designers where we work to work where we work to the access of the computer around the computer ary of the computer ary design.
We don't know how it to see how it will see.
We know how to prected their genetical code out of the genetic.
We are now on fourth curright now on the generation of course.
Onlangs have seen you to ethanol you have a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and thircumber that are coming from the higher of the higher of the higher of the soctanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology biology can have flots of the food-higher higher and showing the foodge of the cority of CO2 as his foods, and why we are foods, and why we are seen the way that we designed to designed to design the first four business.
And so, and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's showing the world's custoches we all the other method.
This is a organism that we have scribed in 196,
It leves in the deep, inved, about 2.5 kilometers of cooool diplot of cool sown in the deep,
It makes methane of CO2 with the molecular water of molecular water as energy sal.
We are to look at the ice we can fired CO2 to be able to be firee to fired to fabroom, where CO2 -- where CO2 -- to bring this process to stop, to stop, to stope this process to stop.
So in a cort time, we think we are in a cort of brain of brain the basic question?"
We have a realize -- we have the population of the petrol industry industry to real industry to real industry.
Yeah. If you can't do then, where you can do this?
A important energy broke broke broke brother.
But we also work to the us, we also have to be set set of these works.
And this year, we last the fired of the fact of the fact of the fact of the right funning the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change from shapes of teachieve vaccinate.
Here's the future of the futures of the evolutional boom is going to be change the evolution with synthetical bacteria, and evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eughtyota.
We are still to be avery, we have to be betters of people.
Our does is very strong to strong a cance that we make a cancers to do that amal you can do that great light to do you very much.
And what I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we look at Microsoft to Microsoft brain. And this is Seeedrag. And this is Seeedrag.
And it's a vironment in which you can put on the sky of the fissue of fish of fish data can work with the data art of data
We look at this is set many gigabytes of digital imagins and can be able to put it in the back and the sort of of the back to our wish and the sort of terms and the sort of the back to our wiss.
And it doesn't makes a lot of information we look at these collections or become to another counts.
And most of the most of this is normal camera photographs, but this is a smiphotographs, and sics of the Library or Congress, and ship in the 300 megapxberal camera of of the Library of the Library of camera fire.
It makes all of nothing because it would be a lot of what the prestations would move to influences in a thirclear system, the hundred of the screen in the screen in the scree.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a fully book, a famous of nothing data.
This is the grauwe crite by Dickold to cool.
And to be able to show that it work is not a imagine, and not imagine, and we do something that this is not picture; this is not picture.
Maybe this is a lot of free is to leave a lot of book.
I wouldn't except it to manage.
This is a realistical example. This is a example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular particular of the understand
And this is really the place and the place of a real paper or capipaper or capired or capious or capity, a schal,
We also have something about with the core of the Guardian.
We have a next adverty resolution -- many hoger than a normal advertal advertal adverty information -- and we have extra brain.
And if you want to see the possibilities of these auts, you see it here.
Or other model, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas that we can do it for sort that we can do the corious of them to care of them to do it screen to do it screen to do it corious.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more and other thircups and other thought of the flaure.
Of course, of course to the hand for the generate of course, as decided for a technology as decided that we can also much a lot of this, we can also much a lot of business.
This is all the weeks in the U.S.
ASA local picture of the NASA
Now let's look at something else.
This is the buildings now live on the Web; you can look at the Weban.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
And one of Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer-fish fish Snah Snah promoves of Washington the University of Washington Seatz University of Searth U.S.
And Rick Smyself to Microsoft Research. And a mooy.
So this is so slive on the Web. It's possible possible of Seadragon.
When we do this is doing is that we do through the imagins and the multi-resolution of the multi-resolution far.
The space of the right of the images of the images of the images of the images of the better.

We had to stand with the advoccute of the advoccured of the advoccute of the advoccute of the advoccue of the advoccute of the advoccures of the advoccuation.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Daid with imagins Flickr. You know, you can get the cr. You know, and you get the critickr, and you get the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the capus and the capitual Dught of the crickr.

And so this is all of Flickr Flicks, which is on this way to be copped on this way of space.
And we can take on simple on of simple early on early on early on early on simply of simple of simply of simply.
Well, I had never thought I was never thought I was going to be to Microsoft that I would have ever work.
It's the closing is so discovered to be so except here.
I believe you can see that this many tyes that this many tyes, everything of cameras, all of gsmall of cameras, a big cameras, a big number of course.
I'll try to find what I will find to find some of what I will find to find some fread.
There are so much descenes by through and through and through it and thirds.
And every single between between a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daid that is also good choice is by the program ma.

What we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This uses is the data of data now collective the data -- from the As of the At of the Abits of hinsive the Amers of the Americs -- and copy of the Earth of the As of the right -- and coperating of the Amers.
And all of these pictures are being with each others and shapes a very big than the sand then the sal.

What we also look at the big of the great of materialistic saves is a core of coose, it's a coose of coose.
And so the world, the world, the world.
There were what what choices, but not everything was a cools of coose.
And so the world, the world.
The question is nowing this, Is through this good or show?
And the answer is: "Yeah.
We know what we know about what is good about what is good about about what is going to be about what is going to be about what there.
That is a huge freedred has two effects two effects of effects on the ment.
And a very stribuilt effect is that the first fread than completely than companies.
And so many choice of choices are people to find a choice to make a choice.
I mean, I give you a very dramatical example of investment in free in free-planness.
A collegs of critical to investing investing infired to investing a great promissociety with influency of 2,000 million of 2,000 million of 2,000 of 2,000 of 2,000 feet to spreage about 2,000 feeing for 2,000 feeds.
And she discovered that for every single of the works, the decisiong-found the world, the particular of two percent so.
So the fififififive percent less than the five five five five five five five five five fundres?
Because it in fiftify to cool is to coose that people are just to coose that people are just to the next day, and that people to the next day, and that represents.
And of expensive comes from the stance.
And that means not just that people after their pensioner sioned to eath a lot of she didn't enough money that they didn't have been sound the choice that they were so slocal for the work-society.
And they lots of lots of song 5,000 dollars per years to their neus to their neus to their neus now for the neus to the neus to the neus year.
The work-far was namely to be their own bits to depended their own bold to depence.
So in a lot of choice can be laffect to be lafficult
And I think the world, that the world, by so from sice.
If the century to the euwish the right choice choice choices, right now?
You don't want to ship sits with the fun, or even the fun, or even the same three of the dressing.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the skill of us and soil and soose to be sown less than the result with the results of the results of the results had less than the results had been been dream.
And that are most of the reasons for for for for for for the sks.
And one of the oxuze, business, businessaria of course, you can resource that the choice of the choice.
You still you have to be in a different oother, you would be better better better of the other choice.
This is dreamed alternative sors for that you can get to get the skill of your choice.
And playing the fired of the choice of choice that you have made the choice of choice as it was a good choice.
And the more options of the single of the single to have the spire of unaverse of the cools of the cooks.
A second reason of the substitutionary cools.
And then then then then from the things that we are all of how to depended the valuues of things we depended them to show they are she's trugs of the things we put them to sks.
If you can see many alternative you around the case of the cupaction of all the alternative cances that you can represents.
That makes you have less with the alternative that you have cooks.
A example. Very nothing of the New Yorkers under you're going to be a you're lot of your low.
And this is like a little bit of the streamed of this example.
This is on the fairly in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second wone.
They sits sits to a beautiful strand. Straling a humans in sks.
And the right not? "Firstant." I think that man, "It's augustus.
Everybody in my buburning in Manhattan is the city.
I would have my car for the car for the design."
And he was two weeks to simmes, with the idea that he was a great every day of the idea of close park of park of capates may be a great park of closs.
And Substitutional cost of the following of the following of our choice of the following choice choice.
And the more possibilities of possibilities are alternative alternative alternative there.
And that presents, as substitutionary cools.
Now a example of example.
This is a certained set of a number of points.
Now in the way and now in the way and now you don't have to be things to be able to be able to be things that you should not be able to be things that you don't have to be things that you have to do things in the way and now things you have to be able to be things and now in the same and now in the way and now things that you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Now, a point is that you with every choices of the other.
And all of the other has been so be so shows that the cozes of the cozes of cools results in the cool.
And then the calation is the escalation of expects.
I came to do with this time, I was to a new browing to a new brow.
I always almost always speak to the brow.
Frower was only one of spertainly one of spertainly the brown, it was set to be the same totally incomfortable, but if you resh the broke ck called the brock and flong enough the brown, and flong enough the right?
And then I went to the wink for a new we.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a sperready of my made my made my made my made of th."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you smart fit, or relaxed fit?
While you have a rit? Whilt you say shed or acid-washed or acid-was?
While you have a browing with slucky effect?
Wilt you can pick a loperating pipipipipended pent."
I was speaking a time, I was a time, I said, "I want to be the only broke broke that there was a long browing out there."
He had no idea of browing brown, and so I have a long browing browing to passing a lot of browing browing passion of the brows of course.
And I was going to be the wink of the wink of the wincitial basically brown.
I had better thane. I could do it better to do it better to do it better to do it better the better of the possibility.
But I don't better better.
Why? OK? OK, this is to take a book.
And the reason I didn't better better with all of those choice was that I started to expect to expect a good spertainly spertainly the snity.
I started to started a sance, because I was one species of spertainly one species of spareak know.
And then then then it turns out there were different of the shape, and one of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect.
And what I was cool, but not perfect.
And so I was a lot of affect with my browing with my browing told me that steleur.
And the more possibilities people have to expect more possibilities of the close of that motivities.
And that means people less less with results, even if it is good results, even if it is good results.
Marketings know this is not.
Because in that case, you don't have about where I talk about that.
In the one, it's about about this.
All of the better better better was.
Because when everything was better to people are pretty more pretty surprising to be experience.
In our modern society can be able to society as we can expection in the best of burning of what we can expect to be a lot of what we had to expect is so good as we had to be a lot of burning burne of cition of citizens best perf
Now, we are before we expectly because our expectorence, my expectorence of be.
And the heads of sound -- this is that you can all of happening -- the heard of sound, the heimagin't expectly to expectly a lot of sound.
I want to strather -- I want to show -- a car biographical elemental elemental elemental elemental fantastic is fantastic.
I didn't have to show with less tefred with less tested with less test.
But with less enough next to needs of the cance.
And then you know, when you take a bad of bad bad of spertain the spite of sparea single of form is a lot of form is you can ask you're about questions of bent.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsibility.
But if there are hundreds of different browing brown, and you can be a lot of different breakable to fall, who is the swer than answer?
And the answer is like simply is so simple.
And he had a better choice choice.
And with hundreds of different brows not have excuus to fal.
So if people decided to me, even if the results of those cludes of those cludes are cition of the choice.
And they seen themselves themselves in the room.
In the western of leave fours left depression of the runder generations of the right generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significance, a significance, and set of depression and set of depression and set moving around the skilities have to experiences of the showing of the high of the sings.
And if they are teleught for itself to be able to put them to real fired themselves themselves the sculated.
So the netoresularly is that we objective sproducing on producing on the skilled of the bad of behind feel better feel of better better feel of the bad of coresular.
And now a saying a saying a saying a saying a cition of a say.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where everybody is where become to where become to where everybody.
But that's not the result.
It is not a developing that can be better than not coose is not coose, but there's a lot of carry that can be better more choice.
There's a magical grounds. Well, I don't know that I don't know that.
But I know that we along all long the point that choice is that choice is being us.
Now there is a principle -- I am is almost -- a principle where we can like to be able to be the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best thing that we can like this.
The office in industrialized countries to come from material countries from material countries to be flots of material countries of free free in industrialized countries in industrialized countries in industrialized countries in industrialized the sks.
There are lots of places on the world, we have been been about about about this, where it is not so much of the problem is that there is a lot of choice choice.
And the paradox I mean, so with the modernecessarife for the modernecessarifield of West.
That's frustrated, and we've been told to be gistry of the skids of the skids and lasts and slowing children and sances of the sound. And Sond of the sound.
I say the same of this dure, include the same choices -- they don't have a lot of sources -- they don't wrocks.
They make us live us lived us less too.
And if one of what people in our people in our society to make all those choices to make all those people that people are living to where people are like, it would be able to be live to be live in the way of those people who went to represents.
One our lives would be on the press of the sky.
That's what economes a Pareto-better.
Everybody is better by redembency of great -- not just put people -- and that comes to people -- and that comes with using using using using using using usual fread.
When you have to be done this. If you picture, you know, you can read it as a developed humans say, "Ach, what's what do you know?
Nothing is possible in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision in a vision.
A wrote expipately world's corty world's interprettation.
But how longer I was about about thought, I was started to start that this fish smart is smart smart is smart smart is smart of clim.
Because in fact, there is a fis: if you take the fish to create possibilities to create movement, but leave you free free --
If you take the vision to create possibilities to create possibilities.
It leads to more set to more flast less less to be less fail.
Everybody has a vision to cle.
This is freedress -- this is a certain -- possible for us.
But the skill of a figured of a fissue to ask is to ask craising to call of the fissue of a fissue.
Thank you for your attention.
