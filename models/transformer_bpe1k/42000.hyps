Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, that the pollished the last three million years of the last three million years of the United States with the United States with 40 percent of the United States was a police crows.
But this distributed the most sequence of this particular problem because it doesn't showing the disease of the ice.
The ice capital climate in a climate climate system.
It put out in the winter and cracked in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a accelerated version of what the last 25 years of what happened is the last 25 years of what happened is happened in the last 25 years of what happened is a accelerated version of what the last dia I showing showing is a very accelerated version of what happened is happening is happening is happened to be a version of what happen
The permanence, the permanenceived in red.
As you can see, it set out to dark blue.
That's the yearal ice during the winter every year at the winter every year.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanence, five years or older, is almost like blood, is almost like bloom here.
In 25 years of this went from this to this this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen found, the North Icelebrating and there was a very large amount of global warming carbon the frozen carbon mean, when it was death, by microbes in methane.
And, with the total amount of the total reinition in the atmosphere, could double the amount of the amount of the capital considering point to considering the capital to consider.
In some deep anyway, in Alaska barn caska bit of water.
Professor Katey wind Professor Katey Walter from Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another type mean.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real to be that will be used to be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge heat the Greenland from the north.
This is a melt melt of through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through this is a melt melt melt of melt better.
The water volume is the water than ever larger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua's suifer in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea less of the sea leader, because it melts melt, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These strops taking flight to flip this.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the South Pole, the most imass on Earth.
Plast month, scientists that the whole continent now is that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly very quickly to the melt melt of the meltor,
The whole continent sea less for six meter, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass, there are now new now that were new now glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population population is to get half of his drinking water from that melt time.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stream.
But when they disappeared, disappears to the drinking water.
In California reduction of 40 percent in the snow Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reading it, are the predictions of it.
This global dressed dream to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of natural disasters around the world is still and never seen with an incredible and never seen speeed.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intential.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the past five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 million tons of CO2 hours.
25 miles took every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of Stille Ocean, from America, from America, westest and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic declassist of oxygen in the oceans.
The only major cause of the Earth, is developed deforest, which is deforest, which is burning fossil fuels.
Oither a problem, and step coal is the most engineering problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest triots, with China.
And there was a very single to build more stem carbons.
But we see a closely of it.
These are the stem carbon that the building became annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives were presented to the last years,
There's a political battle on the country.
The steone carbon and oil industrial gave industrial for 250 million dollars to promots, which is a contral carbon clear, which is a contrain.
And that image to me think about something like this.
And the charged was home in Tennessee, at home in Tennessee, four billion gallons of believed mode.
You probably seen the news.
This is the one biggest display in America.
This was happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the cooling lindustry around the Kerst,
Video: "Frosty the climbing carbon guy is a happy craft guy --
He's a preference preference here in America, and healthcare that our economics.
Frosty the stem carbon guy is being a day clear.
He's paid and cutilized and copated their jobs."
And here's a big part of the steone buy of the stepped Virginia from the rened.
The largest mine workers of the country is the great boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clearly Gore, Nancy Red, Nancy Red, Nancy Red, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate protection for Campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of this.
As "Buine COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threating for our things.
That's the reason why it is our most important goal is to give a massive to address the light and the regull of the light and the real letting the truth of the truth of the truth of truth.
Fit is, steone cool is not smar.
We find that it's clean clean. And it smells lead.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me be that only used to us.
Video: Acure carbon the cool, you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean coal clean-coal cro-coal central.
Fantastic! The machines are making a lot of lawy!
But that's the sound of clean coal cool technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the burning of the global causes of global warming causes of the Earth, the remarkable city-clean technology that you see here.
Look around the clean carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Eintuitive alternative alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that at the area of national security.
Video: America climate crisis, the economics, the economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire with all of these things are our dependency of fossil fuels, like pollution as pollution of fossil fuel.
But now there is a course, new solution to get this.
And involved America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America plan to the work of work, a plan that makes us safe to the earth of the earth opain.
And eventually a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Antde.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It's about reindem: It's about America reinde.
One of the fastest ways of making an engineering to our dependence, fired fuel of old fuel to help them help our planet.
Man: Here's the future Wind, sin, a new energy system.
And then Man 2: New investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic to become realist.
Al Gore: There's an old African talk that says, "If you want to be able to be able to do that, you get to you.
If you want to go to together, you go together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduced an introduced the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an upon how that works with an update about how that works.
So here I am doesn't have to those who didn't have the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever supplies, 27 miles in ground.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion billion times less than a billion times a second of a second.
Enorm ambitiously, so.
This is the machine Geneve.
We took photographs of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one I work with the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in construction so you can see the scale.
At 10 September 10 September last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That made care in the controll,
It's a photograph of the first particle that all the way around the LHC should share the LHC with a piece of the LHC with a piece of LHC, and put particles in the detector.
In other words, when we had these picture picture at 10 September we knew that the machine work, which is a huge overwhat's a huge over.
I don't know if this was the largest of the most profound, or this, if somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page looked like the Internet page looked like this.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden down with these golden carries.
And those we've been learned 13 thousand amper that the machine on full power to full force the machine on full.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small wear."
They can do that because they can do that because they can be superceive on whole low temperature
So at multired the globs between the stars, the stars, that can close the stars, that are clows that stream behaviors can be wradiate.
In one of the connections between the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was something that was something warmer, and there was anything electric resistance against 13 thousand amps of electric resistance,
This was the result.
This is even impression if you realizing that those magnets more than 20 tons of away that those magnets more than 20 centimeter of the tool.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did.
We all have repair them all tool.
Now they're going back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We'll put it again, and we expect measurements in June, so we can go figure out what the building building the construction of the universe.
Now, of course, have that increase the debate of the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so difficult the fact that we go further, the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the dection of the valuable experiments of his teachers of his teachers of his teaching was Michael Farael Fara's progression of the progress of human mine than the subject of the human minds of the human minds that there are no reminds are not completely definitions, that our completely are not incompletely definitions, and that there are no matters to designing that there are no matters to definitive the definitive the definitely definitirespaves are no matels to be no maticions,
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask to ask to your children's time, when you played with blocks played with block.
When you found to discovered how to graduate it and consciously away, you actually discovered with the problems with the surroundaring and depended with space relationships.
And Rumultiply insight is a strong because with the understanding the world to understand us.
If an information -- what if an inspired by physical interaction with objects -- samping objects -- samping with my advisor Jee Pattion and my computer Jee of Kalanithi -- what if we use a computer to be able to ask me -- what if we use a computer individuals as a kind of digital fingers that mose to a plate desh information that moves to a plate information fish information flating information ful,
and can orders as we want?
This question to this question that we decided to look at a answer to search a Siftables.
Cortly, a Sift is an interactive computer in a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can be moved, they can capable to detect each and they contain a discovered and wireless contact.
The core is the physical tradel of the clocks of blocks to grain and grab they can be moved by it.
And top of a new ecolic example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And before this tools have a more physical different physical different and faith, and even of the way we have to movement, and even of the way we move them move, there are different new and fun interactions and fun interactions
I will start with some simple example.
This Sift is to show to do a video is to show that plays, and played by cancers plays, and othershed plays.
This interactive portraits are each other.
And indicately, they will be interested in each other to each other.
If they are getting it and they can do this and can be able to be able to single this as well.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting sequences of the interaction of the interesting of the interesting of a color was a liquid of color was a liquid --
In this example of the example of Siftables of remarkable to use color in a leave of leg, where they are mixed to be color in a legact where they are being mixed to be color in a leg of leg, and I can use them to get color in a leg of leaving into a lot of leaving in a leg inside this example of the example of the
If we have drive, we got some back to what back.
There are some capabilities for education, mainly play play games, mainly play with language, and logics that we want to give people to things fast, and the result to see things fast.
Here's a showing -- this is the development of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmmatic programmmatic reseries of a series of development -- this is the development of a simple calculating programmatic resh mate.
Here we show you a game between a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single to get a point to every Siftable, and sensed words are controlling in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is being a very rescued to be rescued to be a new series of letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excurion to the Media Lab, and I'm in it to make them to make it out to make it it out to make it out to make a video.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have instructions that people need to instructions that people need to instructions that people need to instructions of this application is that people need to instructions is that people need to need instructions that people need to need instructions is that people need to need instructions that people need to have instru
Everything you have to say is "Make word," and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at test the test of test other people at tribute
That's our young basically test, right-her right.
It looks like he just said, he just said, "Siftable.
For it was only blockss.
Here is an interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for teach language.
This is Felix that demonstate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftle, by the Sift with that characters of the table.
Here it is emerged to come up with the sun
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good day! Yeah!
And by shaped Siftable, and the next to each other places to each other -- Video: Weail, Wealy!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decisions how it distrip.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example that I will show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have developed every Siftables and drum.
One has been every one has been taking variations, where you can use what you want to use to use.
This sounds can be injected in learning Siftables are injected so that you can get the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the attions of a leading Siftable effects are live controllable, and filter.
They are being a sound and added it to a sound and addressed by can't be able to sound and adapted by can't be applied to a sound and additions.
And so, the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a lot of first pattern, to a lot of extra lead.
Now I put the based based the basly.
Video: DM: Now I feel a little bit slaggulate.
Video: There I put the filter to the filter to the filter to the drum of the drums, so that I can influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate it by the cancering of the block of blocky.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter to the filter of the basas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rewrite the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to anything everything to plans, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter as I want.
With finally, the dims of the volume of the volume Sift to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new human computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces that are stemed in the way our brain and working and working and longs.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design region this design area with some possibilities that we're developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is only the attack is that this is only a new generation of tools for the interact with digital media, which are the information to our world as we want.
I thank you.
I look at it with you.
I'm writing for a long.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long for for for a long time, and I don't think that that will be changed.
And yet, there is understanding something in my life's going to happen in my life, and career with my work with my work with my work rein.
It started with a book that I did a recently, a memoire, "Eten, Biddle -- "Eten, Biddle in the trick of my earlier world and a very international destinctive the whole world and a decept of the whole world was going to be international deplow.
The consequence is that people all everywhere, and always I came up with me and always means.
Woretive --
People come to me and ask me to ask me to me and ask you will never be able to success this success is never going to be equally equally event?
Don't you afraid you will be write you'll be write published more a book is going to be publish where people will be heat?
Don't you afraid that?"
It was very reason you, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be remember 20 years ago, I was when I was a teenager, when I was writing that I wanted to be write for write to become a decade.
People said, "Don't you afraid you will never be success?
Don't you afraid for dealing, that you will go through it see?
Don't you afraid you will be able to this work without there is ever going to be able to deales something from the public and you will deploy on the public ax?"
Something in that stretch.
And in the short comes to this questions to this questions to this questions "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that are being end.
Always the ways of all.
But I'm also much other things frightened to know that all of the other things that all of them.
For seawler for instance, and other end,
But what write is writing myself the last time that is coming from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody to be afraid to be afraid to the work for the work for the work for the work of work on earth of the work of work for the work for the work of work to their opin?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we made us to make the effects of it in the mind mind that we make us a little bit of work in other work is not happened to be able to do the work of work is not happening to do the effectively.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a course, that there was ever asked to him or he didn't afraid he was not any for the bangled to way.
And this is "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, so it didn't work about it.
And to be fair to be fair engineers have been engineers have been reputation to be able to reputation for piece of manical depression of manice;
And this, they have this kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human beings are instable.
Look at the grimy death death the most magnificant creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often do by own own own to do it.
And even those those who don't have self-murdering place, seem to be able to own their gave under their gave to give to the gave under their gaves under their gaves under their gave muricate.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Well, each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a kind of what to say about life work.
But of this kind of influsion we don't look anymore.
We've all heard it before, and they have heard it all before.
The hearing crazed is that creativity is that creativity is unlocated with suffering and that an artist, and that a artist, including will lead to ellere.
So I want to anybody here today, here today, to you have that idea life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it is not all the way I think about it all the way at all.
I think it is closely.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century this is going to be so much.
We can have creative mind better to live.
I know certain to me, in my situation, particularly dangerous dangerous life.
More the fase where my career now in my career now.
Go only after say, I'm young, amper safe years.
I can may be a four decades --
Hueyard will be seen anything I have published by the outside world as the world that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up with friends up here, so I can clapping you probably do my greatest success is all behind me.
Yem, what a idea !
If you think about it, you're going to know the morning to know the morning to the need hours to the bottom hours of the board.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me work with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work that I love with the work where I love.
The question is, "Hoom?"
After long time I think I was going to be concerned that I can only go with writing when I can only deal with a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a safe distance between myself and my overage myself and my overage for the reactions of reactions on my future publications.
I have looked for ways last year for ways to ways to ways do that.
I have been down in history and have disined me in other societies have found in other civilizations to see if others have found creative people to deal with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My questioned me was business with the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let again, because it's a long and complicated story.
In time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed people believed that creativity was coming from themselves.
People believed that creativity was a divine minute, unknowledge place to humans areaable reasons.
The Greeks called the Greeks called "demonen."
And so, Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had influisting.
The Romeins had a kind of equal idea.
And in the way that we called a geniused to be a geniused to be a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their promise was a genius, a geniused to be a geniused to be able to put in the walls of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist of work was working on the genius.
And it was incredibly shaped form to work on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about the earlier protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work.
The artist was so in protection to be a lot of narcism to many narcism
If you was brilliant to was a brilliant there.
Everybody knew that a nail that you had hology geniused to holp.
Well, then you cracked out that not just you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genius.
For time that the time is creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed everything
There was a very new idea of idea: the individual human being is the tools of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the divine world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual propriate.
And for the first time in history was talking about artists artists that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I think I think a big faul.
And to single one person, one person, one individual individual that he or she or she's filled mystery, the source of the century mystery, of everything godly, from everything is dived to a fragic and the familiar human psyche.
Anybody somebody asks you to swing the sun in sun clic.
Egos are blowing up to hugant proportic proportions and there are unimaginable, and there are expectations of experienced to experformance.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years many artists blots of artists has made a lot of artists in the last 500 years of artists.
If that is, and I think is the question is "What now?"
Can we do this differently?
Can we understand back away from the relationship between the relationship between humans and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of during speech.
Probably there are people in the audience in the audience of people who are talking about the idea that eliminating elaborating the idea that eliminspiring feeding the work of artists to inspiring artists to inspire areas.
It doesn't seem to be able to get to all of you in that.
And yet, I won't ask me it it.
Why not?
Why would we have to do that thought that thought that thought this thought ?
It was just as much as much as all the other explanations of the total intential infability that decided to the creative process.
Everybody who have something has to create something to create something has been doing -- so in fact, in fact, all the presentation here -- knows that the creative process of creative process to be drive.
That it sometimes almost paranormal.
I have recently did the great American closer Ruth Stone meet meet meet
She's going to be in the nine. Her whole life writing though.
She told me about her childher childher country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field, she did sheard a poem around the country.
It was so said that they were so like a big wave air.
So'close waves about the country to her the country to her it.
She felt that the ground under her feet, and she knew that her to do that her at that moment only stood for her life.
She was ran home, followed by the poem and she had to get to get to get out and see paper.
When the poem through her hold her holks was that her only to write it to write it up.
Sometimes it was not fast enough.
Then ran and ran and ran ran and ran doesn't reach the house.
At certainly called her her close to her it, looking about the fields, looking for a different closer words -- to another close -- to another power.
And it was also anything that I think -- this is the most most most of the story -- that she dialting the poem -- that she dialing the poem -- they were the poem -- they were the poem of the story --
And then she was in home looking for paper and paper, and lapses the poem through her it.
Juist that moment had to pick up a potassible to pick up a possible
And with her other hand, so told me she plucked me to put the poem from the air.
She picked up with his tail, and put it back in her body, while she wrote it back in her body, as she written it up.
In that cases the close came to the case came to paper, but then in reverse to paper and followed follow.
When I heard -- what I thought -- what happens to be able to do is so walking my creative process.
That's my creative process is not anyth! I'm not medium!
I'm a mule, who are a mule, who are every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating through time.
But even in that day that every day I have one one one of this experience I had one one of experience.
You will also know it will also be able to know that there are creative ideas in your clock clock from a source that you can identify impossible you can identify inside you.
What is that source?
How can we use the without we can use the without we have become crazy?
On a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think I can think I can think I can think is musicious Tom Waits.
A couple years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had this over.
And in fact, a big part of his life of life have been showed from the showing of the aware of the available to get to the unfortable to get to the unfortable creative impable creative impable creative impable creative impactable creative impable creative impable to dive impable creative impact in the way.
With the years was a bit of a bit was a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit was a bit of a bit of a bit was a bit of a bit of a bit was a bit of the years.
And one day he reflect in Los Angeles about the speeaway, and changed the process of radical.
And as he got there and heard there was a fragmental from a meloddie.
The decided him, like inspiration that every inspiration that decided to do, understand,
It was a nice nice and he wanted to hold it it hold hold.
But it didn't did.
He had no paper, no paper, no paper to be tane, no taperecort.
The famous excited excited excited excited to me, "I love the melods, and then it turns me to get the high back to me to hold me eun back to me to be the melodd of the way to get hold of the melo
I'm not good enough, I can't do it anyth."
He was not a panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up, and he looked up, "Sorry, you can't see that I behind the sky of the sky and said, "Shit?"
"Do you really think I can write a song,
If you really want to get that this song, you have to class another class when I have time for you.
Now, it's not going to be a difficult differently.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohency from that moment sloser of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing that is the same dark of the dark subtan.
But the heavy of the creative process that the creative process in him distanced the genius.
The genius, to close the skin and liver liversion and liver returned to be able to close to the skin and liversion and liver it was a close to the skin and liver disincated to the skin and liver ske.
And then realized that there was no reason it to go to through it.
It could be a wonderful, bizare, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the owners that did not all at all.
That story has changed my way of works.
I have been close to this.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle in the writing of Eten, Biddle in the middle of Eten, Biddles.
At a given moment I avail.
You know that you don't want to be a good work and you don't think it's a terrible disaster disaster disaster book it.
Not just just bad of bad, really horribly bad of bad bad of bad
I wanted to close the whole project.
And then I rememed Tom that I was came to his genius, and I decided to be a position.
I wish my manuscrips and I did me to a lot of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room and director.
And I said, "Listen I said, "Listen though we know everybody is not just coming to be able to get through myself is not just by me.
You can see that I have everything in me everything I have in my own in me.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it have to do better you're going to come to do your thing you.
Do you don't have that, until then, under that.
I just write down, because that's now my work.

Euws came back to the North African desert people in the North African desert people to sack with sacres on sacred music.
Uring and hours and hours and hours ear, to the morning
That was always amazing, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, very time happened to be something like this,
One of those dancers became than transcendent.
You know what I mean to do is curious with you, you have ever seen anything about a performer.
It was like the time stood time and the dancing and the dance sticked up.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights and now everything together.
And suddenly he did not longer only a human being.
In him, under him, above it comes to him, above it way.
A fired fired through him.
And if one thing that was happening to be able to clapping people what it was Dan they started to clapping them to clapping and close to clapping "Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historically factor: Toen the Moren Spanu Spange Spanu Spange Spanu Spange Spanu Spange Spanu Spanu Spange South Spanu Spange Moren Spanu Spanu -- and the M
The quoke is realized by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other."
That hurt today to the day still fights and flamengodancing and flamengodances.
If a potential in Spain, you do something impossible or magically does, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, browd broad."
Anyway, sically, sice: a glimpse of God.
Pections what we need to need it.
Lasticly is the last dancing the next morning to discover the morning to discover 11 owns in the morning at the morning charge more charge more charge charge more lage charge more lage more charge to discover the morning to the discover.
And at that point is a little older guy with decept knever before to such more that may never to be able to such a high.
Maybe there will never anybody God will be dancing God will dance.
What should he now with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to make a creative minute, for a creative mind.
But so painful it doesn't need to be not to be able to be not to be able to be not to be able to be not to be us.
Imagine you don't have any of that the most unusual aspects of your person taking out of your person to come from yourself.
Imagine you believe them a while, you know, she got to be a whiled to specify resource.
When you're ready to you, they're geting to somebody else.
That's what it is to considered everything.
I high inside the inside of inside thought.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside corned to be approped to be looking at a time.
The opposed to the follower progregating forest.
And if my thought to me with me the hall, I keep the same thing that I think the same way, I don't fright.
That's just the work.
And, you just do this, what it is.
If you go to dance, dancing a dance.
If the divine genius that you is to be able to decision to decision in your work at enough moment of the wonderful sources by lying to get to let up in your work on engage by long time, "Olse."
That's not happening, dance then, but doing through it.
And also "Ole !"
I believe that harted's believed for hearty.
"Oly, anywhere, because we pure out of human love and wisdom by human love, and yet it by still human love.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I have a few of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that mean, and what that can mean to do mean new sets of genes.
We actually started to start from a new point of point of digitizing biology to digitize, and now we try to go to a new phase of digital codesigning to go to a new phase and synthetic designing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand on different levels in different levels levels.
We tried approaches of different approached approached to minimum components.
We're now about 20 years now it's digitizing digitization.
When we have sequenced the human genome ceil, it went from the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask you, can we regenerate life, or can we regenerate new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalum, Mycoplasma genital, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory laboratory in a laboratory laboratoratory to be in a laboratoratory of a sort of a kind of organism, Mycoplasma genitalum, Mycop
And we tried to look at a non-break genome can get a non-genome can get genome.
We can take in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or soil,
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively relatively simple to the one.
Gelebrate me, this is simply simply.
But when we look at all genes to all genes that we can get piece of the genes that this would be a living celling cell that this would be a living cell.
We decided that the only route prevalue was to synthetic to synthetic so that we could be able to synthetic so that we could be able to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we started a chromosome, "Can we started a chromosome,
And the chemistry to make this very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, a chromosome, "called """"""""
A chromosome, by the way, by the way, it's a piece of chemical material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing digitizing life is accelerating exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code, but is a rather slowly slowly, but is incredibly enefit to be a genetic code.
And our last point would be places at this point in an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of stage, to start with a bio-ethic captured captured to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it more mistakes there are more mistakes in the world
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little bits and corrating all pieces and corning all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that death.
We designed the pieces, did the bags,
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we started to piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria global code, and virtual code.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they got back out of the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was until I was speaking with the oil industry, and I said that they were model to be a captive.
They laughing more than you.
So we think this is why we think this is a situation in which the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettled in cassetttles, so we could varied the cassettes of viruses, so we could varians
to understand what the real real components of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that are digital information in the computer than that are very digital information in the computer than that are digital information in the computer than that are very digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very digital information in the comp
When we first first came to this genome collabled in 1995 was the standard standard per 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 mistakes of the original sequence of the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to
As design the design is the designing pieces that are 50 letters that have to design with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so they have to design so that they can go to design so that they can go so that they can go to design so that they can go so that they can go to design as that they can go to design as that they can go to design as that they
We designing here unique understanding in this.
Maybe you have read to stop water market that we stop water this.
And think, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, C, Gend, and T.
Trios of those letters codes for roughly 20 aminose -- that there is a similar any clear to each aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code, we can use word to write words --
And in a cigious closely called "We're just a multiple of closely called "We're just a multiple of the case of the basically.
Some people were teleurged that there were no poems that there were no poems
We have designed these pieces that we can eath them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repay and repair and each other.
And we started to make pieces of pieces that were five to 7,000 letters that were five to 7,000 letters of 2,000 letters, and you have pieces of 2,000 letter, take to 72,00000.
In every stage in every stage, we could have a conflush of these pieces because we could be created to be able to create a process that is very robuilding -- that will be a process -- that will be a business.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we get to the really big pieces of the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseven, they don't grow in E.
That really, the exert of all the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolog recombination, which is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA and that pieces can add a lot of the biologists can add a mechanism that is used by the biologists to repairs.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radio durans that three million radiodurans to can.
You can see in the top panele, she simply single crite of each other.
12 obvious later later, he put it in each other, exactly as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely opinious.
They can be in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can life in space, that can existence to move that may move, that can find move, a new aquatical environment.
NASA has married showing that there is a lot of it, there is a lot of it, there.
Here's a real microphile, with the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually made with these processes -- actually yesterday mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we design them in the right design of the pieces that we deed.
And it's making care that they automatically add automatically add automatically conceive.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication we expected incentive.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million of too.
If we would take it with a 10 points letter, no speak letter, there is 142 pages -- there is 142 pages to pressures to pressures the genetic code.
All right, how do we started a chromosome, how do we activate?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you put under eukaryots, like we just knew the cells and doing another in, and that's what you know is what you know is what you know if you know if it closs.
And if you have the bacterial species is chromosome, in the cell, but we have showed that we have a full transplantation of a chromosome, and we can activate a chromosome, and it can activate.
We have a chromosome, a chromosome.
These are about so far as far from each other as people and mously mously ailable and mously mously mously as people and mice.
We add some extra genes that we could take a little bit for this chromosome.
We have been trusted with enzyms to make any proteints.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be able to value the very advanced graphic images -- the new chromosome in the cell.
We even thought he would come to be able to develop the process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a third chromosome, or a third of thousands of properties in one time time to the species.
People who proposed to reach one of the evolution equalize evolution to the same time.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that are actually display deter.
The chromosome, it was not ever eventually anywasn't ever educated it.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop it in the way -- well, well, well,
It was expressed, and it was recognized the other chromosome, and it opened the other chromosome, and then we had eventually the cell of the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappearing all the characteristics of the one species, and he changed completely in the new species, and he had changed on the new software that we stop in the cell that we had stop.
All the proteins of the proteins of the mbranches -- when we dilapses was changed.
This may be able to sound as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
All right, I have been paid better that this is not a creation -- this is a continue -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have paid that we may be a new version of the Cambrought that maybe making news to make large new species where there are major news in this digital design,
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it needs is.
We're going to be going to be from six-en-half to billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now people on this planet,
every one of us who lived in 194, in 1940, that there will be four in 1940 years that there are four arms will be four
We have transmited with food, with clean water, medicine burning water, fuel and a half billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion of water, fuel with food, fuel with food, fuel with food, fuel with the six-encare of water, fuel of the food, fuel of clean entirely and half burn-half burners-half burn-half billion water, fuel and a half billion wat
That's a difficult to do that for nine ine to do that.
We use five billion tons of collable, more than 30 billion five billion of oil.
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we take biological processes in the any showing or any percent to replace that; then that is going to be a huge challenge challenge challenge.
Then there is all all those carbon dioxide of the cool dioxide in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmo
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see if the design components for the future components for the future.
The electronics had been doing a dozen diversity had a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronics had been doing a dealing components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronics.
We're constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got technique fast, technique synthesize this called "combination genomics."
We've got the capability to build a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the processes of 20 million different genes, or trying to optimize processes to make octan, to produce octan, new vaccines, we can change vaccine, we can change more molecular than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard standard of selection.
We can select select for life vailable or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccinproduction, vaccine, vaccinproduction, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vacc
This is a mafaimagination of what real design software where we work on the way that we can actually design a new kind of the computer can design computer.
We don't know how it will be looking at a person in it will be able to see there.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We focus now on fourth generation.
And, you know, you have seen a bad of seen your grain, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come inoffs that will come in, as sugar, to more high-higher fuel as higher fuel as the ength or anything buts.
But the only way we think biology can have biology major influence within the food price without the food price and available to start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food forever, and we think that we do it in the way that it way, and we think we do the first fixatory entire ful futures inside about 18 months inside about 18 months in about 18 months.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our global discovery -- but by our global discovery --
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea -- about 2.5 miles deep, with cooking, cooking, showing it called temperature
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy source.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 -- what easy is easy to be able to get into factories, where that are getting CO2 is going to give back to fuel this process.
So in a short time, we think we are able to expand we are able to expand we are able to expand on the basic question: What is life?"
We have realized replace, you know -- the decisinated the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED at TED can't do this, what?
A major energy source to be become
But we also now we're working on these tools to think about these tools to think about rapids to think about rapidly.
This year was the flu, we just just just just something behind the facts of facts as it comes to the right vice is coming on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making it can change from avaccines.
And here is how the future can go out to see the future can go to the evolution tree, the accelerating of evolution with synthetic bacteria, archaecause of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually eukaryota.
We're still away from the improving people.
Our goal is to assure, to sure a chance to survive that we make a chance to survive that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be a chance to survive.
What I want to show you as a new technology is the fundament of a new technology that we have a new technology that we have a came to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you local or in immense amounts of visual data can work with immense.
We look at this here many gigabytes of digital images and can be seedless in here, and making out there and the sort of declass to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a sffect of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixed megapix.
It makes all of it would be anything because the only thing would influence, on a lot of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is a grauw home by Dickens. Every column.
And to prove that it's actually too, and not really drive the real text is, we can do something like this, to show that this really text is a real text.
Maybe this is a strange way to read a book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an incredian.
Every great imagine is the beginning of a subject of a subject
This is really the pleasure of a real paper, and the experience of a real paper, which is actually a scale medium.
We also have something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advert adversisiss of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertisised.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of across the screen of accuts.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more hope and other flaure.
Of course, maps a country for a hand-application for a technology like these, I won't spend time to this field, except we can contribute to this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And put on top on the top, picture.
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected to each other connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promote at University of Washington, defency by Seitz University U.Washington,
And Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see that we do this, we see that we do this, we see the multi-resolution resolution resolution to experience.
The space society of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have broads, so that they are communicated with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomes. Seating diashws of stabilized diashws or panormas, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is time there is other environments.
There are much more space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth prototyper of Photosynth -- to the communicate the communicate of the communicate power of these technique, in the way of these enves in the environments on our websituation on our website.
We had to calculated with the advoces and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Noe Delebrating the Noe Daws with Flickr. You search Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and subject and such the campus and subject the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the c
And every one of these orange looking at the time gives a imagine that are part of this model of model of this model in the model of the model of this model ath.
And so this are all Flickr images, who are all this way in this way.
And we can get on simple incredibly incredibly incredibly entered in.
You know I would never be thought I would have ever thought I would ever work at Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is so did to be so disinctive.
I believe that these are many types are cameras are cameras everything from good to mirror reflexcameras, a big number of them,
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much more covered by faces and such everywhere.
Because in this is even a series of photos -- they're a series of photos -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Noe Delebrated Delementally good chain.
If we dive it poster in the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we want to do is that we can really do things with social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of the office of them, the Earth looks at each other.
All these photos are going to be universe, and form together a lot of greater than the some of the parts.
You have a model that from all the Earth earth of the Earth is
And that as a result at Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use, and which the benefits of the benefits of people who use it.
Their own photographs are before that somebody else data that somebody else somebody else that somebody else somebody else that somebody else data that somebody else data that somebody else data that somebody else that somebody else somebody else to do anybody else.
If somebody would like to attack all of these sacks, and their names and their names my names with all of the data, and I can use it as a communicated to use as an access to that metaph, using the metaph, using of everybody photos, and creating a kind of cross-model, and creating social social experience.
And of course, the course, the product of this immense rich virtually model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just photographs, satellite images and other appropriate priate pictures and other appropriate memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that makes your software possible to a day, in the next years of all the images that are deceither can capite together to get to the world together?
BAA: Yes. What this really doing is discovered.
It creates to your wish wish between images.
And it does that basis of the data in the image.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look for the web page to images, you feel a question in, and the text on the webpage of the piece of the piece of what the image.
What if now that pictured image is to all your image?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of the amount of wealth that comes from that enters are gigantic network-effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and eeating crazy is the opportunity to live the old habits are not forgetting forgetting their past, who feel their past, the attack of researching in researching in the wind, the profitters in bloaves of the bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky still Way, or that the myths of Instead with means with meaning the myths of Instead, or that in the Himalaya bood's bood's bood's still to the bream of Dharma, you remember reading the world that we live in a model in a model of the anthropology is not in a model of the model of the world of the model of the model
the consequence of a lightly set of a applications that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same true reason equires -- Worldn't born kids in the world.
We all make increase incredibly incredibly inition rites.
And so, with the inconnection of the death,
So it can't be surprise, we all sings, dancing and art them, dancing and art art.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the song, and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is about the Penan in the forest, or the Voo-boo-acollier, or the Voo--acollier in the Kaisut in the Kaisut-basically in North Kenya, the Carazi in the Andes-based in the heart of the Saharan in the heart of the Saharan -- this is the guy of the deserved by the whole thing that I required by the whole of Qomolangma,
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learn us all that we can be able to think different, different, our differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give this idea is just to give you hope to do this idea is just hope.
Sames the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and reverse is as important as the biological life is as important.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a cultural physic.
The cruster pass you can define as the totally of all the corn, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are inspirations, and intuitions that are inspiration,
The cruster is the big nalatence of humanity.

Like face is offer heavy is the core fact that ever -- and in many larger mate.
No biologist would take to expensive half of all species on the point of all species on the point of extinction of extinction that is not true.
And the right is the most apocalyptical scenario is not even in the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of language.
And then everybody here was born born here, there were sixthousand languages on Earth --
A language is more than her word or her grammatic rules.
A language is a captic of human soul.
It's the vehicle of which is the sick of every unique culture, the material world.
Every language is an awish language, a distant minute, a thought, a ecosystem of spiritual possibility.
From that six, thousand language today the day half of that is not a children fluist.
They are not taught babies to learned babies
Effective means that unless another change, that they're death that they're death they're death to be already death that they're death to be a change,
Is there anything about being reverse by concerned by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, not to have the wisdom of the wisdom of the ancestors of the children to see or the promise of the children have to see the children to see the children doing the children to see the children in the last of your people,
Pified solved any one anybody's legs to be any two weeks and dies any two weeks dies of the last letter-honor, and with him the last letter-hone-letting language.
Some of you say, "Wouldn't have better place if we all share the same language of the same language of the same language -- let's take Kantonees. Or Kantonees.
Or Kogi." You will realize, you will realize how it would not be your own language.
So what I really want to do is taking you today is taking you on a short journey called a single of what is lost in fact, in fact,
Many of us forgotten that when I talk about "another way of being a different way of being very other ways.

And to understand of these sensational things that could understand something about this particularly believe about this particularly believe, that is not cultive black magic.
It's a complex metaphor, complex metaphysical world, very interesting.
Would I call you to call the worldless the world's religions, what would you say that?
Christiand, islam, called boodhism, jodent boodhism,
One continent is always outside clock of the tassuming that Africa did no religious believed that Africa did no religious believed this well.

What foodo, the foodo, is the living and death.
The lives bars barrassed the minds.
The minds can be touch from underneath the Great Water, answer the soul, the soul of living time, so that during the sicl of living time, so that during the one equal moment the follow.
So that's why faithing, "Yeah, you know, "You're going to be wrong to the church and talk about God.

This leads to a amazing true of too, showing trance that pushed silences in trance gling columning column.
This is a demonstrates the ability of the mind's mind to influence the body of the mindly thing is extreme when this is extreme is extreme when this is extremely extremely extremely is the possibility of the minute.

The priests say,

That's how beautiful is to protect this is to call this stuff itself." And they call itself.
And in fact, we are the younger brothers, which are responsible for destruction of the world.
And this point is very important.
If we think of indigenous and landscape, we often get Rousu seau and landscape, and the old fabelt of the epart of wildlife wanted to be a that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we put Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth than us.
Indicine, incemled by nically sentimentally, nice closely --
For both is very few space in the malariamoers of the Asmate or in the icro-seats of Tibet. Despenntheless, they have a traditual mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical intuition of the idea of the Earth itself, but on a much subtle, because the idea much of the Earth itself, because the consistan, human being the level.
What does that means a little child from the Andes, which is growing up with the mountain, which is being a mountain an Apu-mine that are going to lead his reading will be lead and another relationship to that fllows place that will have a little child of Montana, that are growing up with the idea that the idea that the mountain a stone that the mountain.
Or it place the lives of a minute, is irrelevant.
Interestingly, the metaphor that keeping the individual defines between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were crazy.
And I did to me another human being than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forests are place of Kuxwhue are place and the Kroms Snavel of Hemel and the Kroms that are respond to the world ratence the earth of the world-swell.
These mind-mind-education decided in their Hamatsa-ineducation.
If you start to the idea that these cultures are different realities, you start to get to get to understanding to a number of their extraordinary extraordinary discovery.

And there is a wooden light that better carboline, harmaline and harmaline in the harmaline and harmaline light and hallucinating light and hallucinating light carbolin,
If you take the plant plant plant that a blue smokes through your consciousness sill reason you.
The plant is mixing leaves with leaves of a coffee every cool, Psychotridis.
The plant plant powerful tryptamines, named by brain dicmethyltryltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryltryltryptamine,
Do you ever the Yanomami as they have as seen that snumber of different kinds of substance of different kinds of methoxyltryltryltryptamine?
That put in a close of your nose is being shots, as a went to painted with barokes to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not diversion of the reality; it ships of reality; it ships of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who discovered the psycheded discovered by his discovery of discovered by his paddos in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean, these tryptans are not to identificate as hallucinated as hallucinated to the industry is increase intrying to experience. Tryone, is to experience. Tryptamines are not oral, because they were designed to be designed by enzym in the human dark in the human dark oxida.
They can be only enoral with something that the monoamin of the samine of the samine of the samine of them.
The fascinating is that the betable carbolines in the limber monoamine-summared monoamine-suppression tamine, the tryptamined. Stel yourself, how can this in a flora of 80,000 planated species two morfological varies, which are involved a biochemical various imagined the parts that are bigger than the parts of the parts that are bigger than the parts of the parts of the parts of the trype of the trypes that are the trypes of the trype of the trypiefline is is is is benoical commitity.
We say eufemistic "trial and reort, which is that as meaningless.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, "The plants talk to us? That's data Deayage of the Cofan, the Cofan, who they can identificate all the big distance of ayhuge distance in our eyes would be identificated in our eyes would be a one species.
If you questions how they were their taxonomics, they say, "Well, I thought you knew something of plants.
You know who's all legs?" I said, "no." I said, "no."
And it turns out to all 17 species in a night with full moon in different moon in different singing.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of a bit of booms than meeling countable.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even those sympaths are indigenous people standing the sympath, and curious and seeing tool, but reduced to a foot-never in the history is the real world, meaning our world, means the real world, dealing our world, means to deal with our world, means as the problem.
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember to be remember to be technological innovations, but earlier as the age we were stood in it, and active participassively particips or passive to the mass destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always to a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is also the problem.
The Sioux-indians not Sious to be Siously, when they gave their pile, when they gave, as wrong as that Americans are stopped Americans when they were their horse and carried up and carried up and way.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the course fear.
The wred face of the government of government.
Whatever you look at the world, you will notice that it's not reflect of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic lives people, whose existences by identifieable forces that are powered to their adaptation.
Or this is now about the enormous deforestation in the home country of Penan, a nomadical people, and with the last generation in the forest of the generation in the forest and now reduced to the display of the rivers, and prostitute to the rivers, where you can see the rivers itself is equarter to the South where the rivers of Borneo to look at the South where Japanese Zice, where Japanese Zevarianese Zevarian inese sance
to fill their creatures will with a tree strip strains out the forest.
In the Yanomami are the disease of the Yanomami are done as a result of discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research, you can see the crun of political government
Genocie, the physical exercise of a people, universal of a people, but etcide, the destruction of life is not only not only distributed not only not only disn't not only distributed in many areas of development.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain, until you get on the basic level, until you get to the basic level.
I have a young colleague about 9,000 miles about country country in West-China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa -- I started the face of the statistics where you heard the statistics where you hear.
Sixty monuments destroying monuments in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was knowled to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis that he was dead death when the Chinvasion was started to the Chinese invasion started.
His uncleaned with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people to Nepal people are left to Nepal al people in Nepal diaspora,

And one day stack it per increase a per incredibly of Mao. For this over-laborated shed them for seven years desperated laborated.
The pain of Tibet can be inevidence is the living minds of the people, but the completely is something to clight you.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Do we have a gray world of simility or want to live a colorrich world of diversity or want to be diversity closely of diversity world of diversity or want to be able to close a colored world of diversity world of diversity or want to be a colorrich world of diversity or want to be a colored world of diversity lived in a colored world of diversity life world of diversity or want to live a colorrich wor
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she was peacefully that she directioned that she direction.
We wouldn't just the human imagination are being model to a smal, model thinking, but we would have away we were agree and forget to wait and forget there are other options to be able to be able to be able to exist.
We can feel our humans feel in the idea that our species is about [150,000,0000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our agriculture gave where we gave us overgave the cults of the seed-shaman replaced by the proza of the priests of the priests of specialization and we got a closer of specialization, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history is not the idea that we give me not the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to be asked to save the meaning of humans are being took 10,000 different votes.
And it is in that song, we will discover the capability to be discovering what we are, a full species, that are a volbeing able species, and all the garbagars to flower flower and all the gardents.
This picture I have this picture on the northern of Baffin Island genome, when I went with Incentives on narrowed in the narrow.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Iner's 1950s, they were to invity, to inity, to initity, in humans, in humans, in humans,
The opa of Olayuk to go to go.
The family wearing for his life, and discared him for his life, and discovery.
Now you have to understand that the Inside not afraid to the coll; they made it used to us.
The gline icro-icy-images were made originally made from fish in charibooks.
Olayuks up, was not afraid for the polning or the storm that wrashed window.
He went out, he went out his brows business, and he put it outside in his hands. When the pool, he put it as a lemmeasure.
He brought a low-eggle on the side of the message of the mess.
When it solid, he slaught to it.
He did the dog, and improvised a harnas.
And from the ribbs of the ribbs of the rible bake.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappears in the ice flate, including pools.
Anything around with nothing running around this, in many way, many symbol for the resistance of the Indicate and all indicate the world.
In appril 1999 gave the Canadian government the Inside from the entire country back from a piece of land Texas together and Texas together and Texas a home.
It's independent area. They are all the solids.
It's a amazing example of how a national state enough to office enough people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly at least for those hits of the world is saved to these honests of the world is saved at all.
They are somebody's home land.
They are standing of the human imagination, who are going to go back to the beginning of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, just as the onze, part of a deceiling geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is inventually invited politicians never reach to do something like that.
We think that a polemic, we think that a polemic, but we think that a polemic of the world, but we think that stories can change the world, which we probably the best stories that are the best stories are being 35 million times a month month months per month months a millions of public.
We make a lot of traveling to resources to the ceat, with our public cultural places, to the same incredible cultural places, where the point of what he sees hopefully anthrough what he sees hopened in different opening the anthropology will be in different opening in different opence in different way, that we can find a way to live in a multural plure plure and plure in a multurealistic world and plure plure in a plure plure and life plure and in a pluralistic world of life and in a way to livalistain a cultual world.
where all the wisdom can contribute to us all the wisdom of us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the questions I did a book of a book of deceil.
Maybe you see parallels with information from other sources.
And I also try to explain some ways that you may be mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma dogma thing, to be the available to get the avail, we have to get them as much as we have to give them as much as we can give them as much as we can give them as much as we can give them as much as possible as much as individual freedom,
Freedom is a great good called a great part of the human being a human being
And top of freedom freedom to accept to accept a higher insight, to reach a higher profession of this.
The ultimate freedom freedom in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more prosperatically wonderful.
This is so deeply in our society that nobody would take anybody would take to doubt it would take a one of the society that nobody would take to doubt that nobody would take to doubt that nobody would take anybody to doubt that nobody would take to doubt that nobody would take
And in our life is this dogma customized again.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Well, ever about dressing.
And in the next 175 can-hon-cup-results in my supermarketplaces are extra-virgin extra-virgin oil and developing camicos awable.
And you can make a number of the number of the own, for the case, for the case, between 175 species for you.
So that's the primarket.
Look at electronics -- you can see there your stereoset saments, you can set say, case case -- lout, case case case mespecier, case power.
And if you put that one electronics you can pick out of this couple of language.
You can be six-en-half million different systems collapses with the systems with the story.
Give -- then you have a lot of chain.
Another one example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could call kinds of telephone services -- but only only ones Ma Bell.
Your hours it to be able to do it out.
That was a considered that the advantage of that was never went to be a piece of this.
That time is passion.
Today there are a lot of different state.
And especially with cellphones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the toolest -- which with message, noseard with mom-player, and crerother.
Wellight you haven't seen this model in the store, but you can certain that that that happens to be certainly happens.
The consequences that people are to the basically and asking this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question to that question that question to that question that question question that question that question that question question that question that question that quest,
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more importantly, the more important than the attack of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices that are much more importants.
Ealth care -- it's in the U.S. it's in the U.S. inside the United States that you go to the doctor, and that you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and says, "We can do that, we can do that, or we can do that.
A has this front and put it up with this front and after that.
And what do you want to do?" What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, what does do you find "Doctor?"
And the doctor, "A has this fantains, and the depended and after that.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, if you was what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm nothing I'm not you."
And we call that "need to bring the patients."
That is very positive, but means in fact, in fact, that the heavy of decision shift of the decision of things -- the doctors -- to a doctors -- to a decision is to certain sick and not the best condition has to decisions, and not the patient. For on recepts.
And, slaws that closely up, because the goal, you can't buy them and I can't buy them.
Why make it again, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask to ask that other brank medicine.
Our idents, this is a completely aspect of us existence, is now moved to choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is our own background.
We find ourselves -- so often we want to do ourselves --
Every morning to the opposition you need to think what for person you want to be able to think about what for person you want to be able to be able to think of person you want to be able to think what for person you want to be able to think what for person you want to be able to think what for person you want to be able to be able to think what for person you
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that every soon that every quy there is automatically cut it as quickly possible, and then then possible as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly
The only real choice was not when and what you did was not when and what you did did.
Now is freeking everything for the opening opening everything for the opening
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, I developed less homework less homework less homework.
They are not dominater or the long time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Well, I sad by the way, "Well, I married now?
Or will I wait? Well, I will wait? New I first children, or a career and care?"
These are all being true.
They are going to have an answer to them, as well, as this means that they don't get all their homework and get it doesn't a good number of their homework and they don't get a good number of their homework did not have a good means that they don't have a good to get to a good me
And they have right. They're important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just given that technology to work with that technology to work every minute every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, by the way, which I love secret WiFi it does.
I don't value, because I want to love to me, because I want to keep to keep mysell
But good, those huge choices of work keeps in that we wonder to ask us to ask us on the way we go to work on the way we go to work or not.
We can look at a football of our son, with our son, with our son, with our cellphone-song, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all get out of standing all kinds of standing every minute of that competition with all kinds of questions, "Well, I do this phone caller?
Well, if you go to this emailt react? Are I write this letter write and write through this letter react?
And even if the answer "Ne," we experience the football of the footbalizing the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we look at this, the small, the materialistic poces, lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestylish of life.
That's how the world looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is nowing or bad or bad or bad or bad of course,
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what we know is good about is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about what is bad about what is bad about it.
And the huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very opposed to effect is that the earlier decided than completely than companies.
With so many choices are as opportunities to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investments in volunteers in volunteers in volunteers.
A colleaguard of me got access to invest data from Vanguard, a big promise with about one million of employees with about one million employees spread acred about 2,000 feating primarily equipments.
And she found that for every decade, the deal funds that worker the worket bowners that are the working beat.
With fifty funds decided to deal with less than five foundards. Why?
Because it with fifty fundred is so difficult to choice that people just took the next day, and that people are simply and so on.
And from outside,
That doesn't mean that those people after their pensioning eating not dream dream because they don't have money money, but also that the choice knowledge that she was the working together, it was so difficult to share the working story.
And they walked to go to 5,000 dollars a year beyond to go on their nose.
The working gears was crased to double.
So a lot of choice can work together.
And I think the world that the world looks like this.
If it goes, if it go to make the eters, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we distribution of us as well, as well, as eventually less teving, eventually less teving, eventually less tevel than the case, if we had less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had been as less to be as much as we had less deployed.
There are multiple reasons to do that.
And one of them is that there is a choice, for example, in the tric ressings, back to keep the choice was not perfect the choice.
You can put you in such a case, for that another choice would have been better to be a different choice.
This is dreamed alternative worried that you get speak of your choice.
And then break the choice of the choice of choice that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice.
And the more options there are more options to have easier to have to be speaking to have uncleaning from the geckoses option.
A second reason has to do substitutive.
Dan Gilbert from morning to the value of things that we are depended the value of things we get them compared with the value of things we get them.
If you can think of many alternatives also quickly, you see all the alternatives of all alternatives that you distrive distribute you.
That makes you have less tevthrough the alternative that you have chose to have chose to you've came to be less text with the alternative.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretched the stretch.
This is a vailized in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second lived of a living.
They are strificly strand. Stral, and again. Go human beings.
Don't do any? "Fere? "Fere," thinks "Well, it's august.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is outside.
I could class my car, I could parkers."
And he is there two weeks to simply simply with the idea that he was a great parking place missioned a great parking place.
Substitutives to be at the cost of the enough that we have to do our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are more possible alternatives are more possible alternatives are there.
And those presenting us as substitutive.
Another example.
This image of a couple of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and that you don't shared things that you're not going to be over.
Another thing is that you can exclude every choices of other choices.
And all that other has been so much as well-edges that the geceptions are less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this is my question I was going to be a new brow.
I always did always speak to always a lot of time.
And in fact, there was only one kind of speech, and that bought you know, it was not totally unbelieve, it was incredibly uncomfortable to uncomfortable to do the browing of the browing of the way and every enough and every enough the room, the room OK.
After years I went to the store for a new one.
And I said, "That's my means a spired to a speek, this is my makes my me."
And the store, "Would you fit clever fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether a ritic? Do you know whether you have stone-washed?
Do you want to be a browing deceither effect?
Would you go out of something in, or flating piles, or flink walking down." And so he went down.
I was speaking a whiless of a timeless, I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only brow.
He had no idea what broken was each that was a long time all the possible browing all the possible brows.
And so, I think of a bit of a bit equield, I left the store brown.
I had better did it better to do it better I could do it better.
But I didn't felt me better.
Why? To explaining myself, I have a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice, was that I started to expect more than the sacian approped speaking more of a good speaking more of the speaking of the fast.
I started without with no only expectation, because I just knowledge.
And then turned out there were different and one of that there would be a vast perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I think I was my browing with my browing with my browing to me with my broad teleur.
The more possibilities people have more opportunities to expectations about the deservices of that possibilities.
And that means are less teving less tevillas, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now.
And in really the way it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was bad everything was bad in the worse.
Because when everything was bad and people were experiences to experiences.
In our modern society can be able to expect as wonderful, but the best thing we can achieve to expect what we can achieve ever expected as we had expected to be able to be expected to be expected as we had expected to expect the best thing we have to be
Never we are surprised to be surprised because our expectation, my expectation, torent.
The secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much fortunate.
I want to stop -- I want to stop -- I want to be married with a case of element, that I am with a woman who really amazing.
I didn't have me with her teved with less text.
But with less enough to take less enough, are good side.
And finally, why you get a bad called a bad cool bad cooks, if there is one kind of a forhand, you can ask you're wondering why you are unteving.
The answer is simply simple.
The world is responsible to you're not a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, and you buy to do it turns to fall, who is to catch a responsible that is responsible to the responsible hundreds of different breaks, and you buy to get to the same up with hundreds of different breaks, who's hundreds of different breakable
The answer to that, just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break to fail.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions, they are closed television their choice.
And they take themselves qualy.
In the Western society society sound the younger generations higher generations are high-generations of time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor at this explosive increase of depression and self-murder, is that people have been so often televisual experiences have been so many expectations.
And if they try to explain that television itself, they give themselves the description for themselves the debate.
So the ntoresulate is that we spoken there objective to go on the objective.
Another a considered for a concerned for a society.
This is the official dogma, which is that everybody for everybody to do where is taken to be taken
But that's not.
It doesn't seem to choices can choose better than not automatically choice, but from that doesn't automatically choice that is better is more choice.
There's a magic boundary boundabilities. Well, I don't know that.
But I know we have been going to be a long time, that choice for a long time.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost -- I am almost -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing we can keep us best the best thing we can keep us the best thing we can keep us the best thing to keep us best to keep us the best thing to keep us best to keep us.
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overflowing countries to flow.
There are lots of places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem isn't so much choice is not a lot of choice is to be a lot of choice.
So the paradox I did is talking about this is a closing for the moder, wonderfully West.
That's frustrated to this, Steve Levitt Levitt has been told yesterday and installing kids not help any couple of your money.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help the same thing to do. Erger -- they didn't help any damage.
They make us less us less than value worth.
If a part of what people in our society in our societies to make all those choices were going to be able to countries to get increase that people have feel to get increase the people would go to it all the people in forward to be forward in the forward of those people in the forward to be able to make all those choices to
And it would be able to go on and put it on the object.
That's what economists call an Pareto-in-improving it.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful, not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we brought to us with our contribution to us with our redisplay --
And finally, if you read this imagine this. If you read this imagine human say, "Ah, what does you know about it?
Nothing is possible in a fish comemen."
A writing imagination, a shortiny global picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I understood that this fish is that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you put the fish to create possibilities to create possible -- but paraloty.
If you break the fish to create possibilities, you get less text less text less text to create the fish to create the less text of creating the fish to create the breakable to create the less of the fish to create the fish to create the breaks to cre
It leads to more lost and less text less texts.
Everybody need a fish of fish.
This is a certainly to constrained -- even for us.
But the way, the way, of a figured figured is to ask to call the way to call the way --
Thank you for your attention.
