For, I showed these two dia's showing to show that the police cap, which was three million years of the last three million years of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United Story of the U.S.
But this is actually the worst of this particular problem because it didn't the difficult of the ice.
The ice cape on the North Pole, in a sense, heart sense, heart of our global climate system.
It looks in the winter and crace in the summms.
The next slide of what I shows is a degree of what the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened 25 years is happened to be 25 years is happened is 25 years is happened is a 25 years of what happened is a 25 years of what happened is a 25 years of what happened is a 25 years of what happened is happened is happened to be a faster the next show.
The permanence is subject in red.
As you see sick, it looks at dark to dark out of dark blue.
That's the years, the year, ice during the winter.
And the summms in summms.
The so-called permanence or older is five years or older is almost like blood is almost like blood to here.
In 25 years is the from this to this for.
And that's a problem because the freors around the North of the North partment and there was a very large amount of faility and there's a very large amount of faility is freorn in methane, when it designed by microbes in methan.
Fore of the total high high in the atmosphere, that could be double, that could be double, that could be able to describe as we can describe point to describe of the engineering point to describe describe to describe to describe to describe in the atmosphere.
In some unch some of the deep muscle in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
At the last winter Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another uneplain.
What is OK. The question is real echer or we are going to be able to be
A reason for that, is that this enormous warms" Greenland from the north.
This is a smeltwaterriver.
The water pulume is the water than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuagest in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea pictures because the lands the lands is the place where it is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea come.
These are taking streams.
On the other side of the planet, on the South police of the planet, the largest ice massive massive massive on Earth.
Africopen months scientists are scientists that the whole continent now is a negative icsbalance balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly quickly quickly with nice few of the South Pole, with some of the South police.
The whole continent state for six meters of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after largest ice massa, there are now new now, that are now new now, that are now going to were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is half of his drinking water of the global water of that smelt of that smelt that smelt time.
In the Andes, is this glassing the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they windown, it also does it also drink water.
In California was a further a 40 percent in the snow.
It's in the water reserves in the water reserves of the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This worldwed global dreaming tributed to a dramatic styce.
And the number of natural world is cited with an incredible and never seen a quickly and never seen fastrip.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the past 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the same from a historic context than you see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 ency 24 hours.
25 miles tons of the oceans, in our oceans, Kean area of the Stille of the Stille Ocean, from America, from the ast-value of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic dragin, there is a drastic dragle in in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, next to design the Earth, which is the burning for 20 percent money is the fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the all of the greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincertained with China.
And there was a lot more still to build a lot more still centrals.
But we see a clear.
These are the cupon cool cool was annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives and where green alternatives were proposed to be in the last years.
There's a political stripe of the correct in our country.
The steences and oil indust-indust-industry gave years to promotly 250 million dollars to promots, which is a cool for promotle, which is a contection.
And that image me to something like this.
And the chair was the currened, at me in Tennesse, four billion liters of the cools of the cools of believed in the cure of the cure of the currened.
You have seen the probably in the news face.
This is the on one after the largest last last last long in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertist of the cool left around the Kerst was this.
Video: ""Frosty the born of the cool is a black church.
He is goal away in America, and he sare in America, and he set that our economy grow.
Frosty the voice coolman becomes with the day
He is pay and cutbile and cup."
Here's a big part of the cities, in West Virginia virginia vanda.
The biggest mincertain of the land is the great base of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship said, "Let me be clearly to be clearly Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they don't know where they talk about that."
Al Gore: So has the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatency for our things.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantic aged to reclassing to recllassing to the light and the truth of value and the truth of vality and the truth of value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the
Feit is, sum-carbon is not so.
We think it's small of the soon is -- and it's clear.
So, you don't make a care clearning about climate change.
Let me be able to us go.
Video: Acteur: Schone carbon you heard a lot of talk.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cool.
Fantastic! The machines are best what law.
But that's the sound of smell technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the burning of the most important causes of the Earth is change the Earth is change the earth is cool that you see here.
Look around the cool technology is the school technology of today.
Al Gore: Einone-past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative at national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red being all these things are all of these things is our dependence of fossil fuels, like pile colls and inmported oil.
But now is a durful, new solution to get here.
Fore America of 100 percent schone electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America work to get a security of us and the warming of the Earth cornership.
And eventually a solution that is a solution to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ont-down.
Al Gore: And the last last one.
Video: Stem: It's going to be America is going to give America
One of the fastest ways to make a long of our dependence of old fields that are fields that are helping our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking that says, "If you want to be you, you're going to be able to everything.
If you want to go, good."
We have to go, and speeak.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hicle of how that works.
So here I am here. For those who were not waren: the LHC is the most largest scientific experiment in the miment of 27 kilometers in the miles in the miles of the miles of the long of the most scientific experiment in the genes that are not been in the way in the miment of the time, here.
It has to be the dignituons that were able to be a billion less than a billion of a billion this, the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enormous, this!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors that I work. And this is the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA, 22 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLAS in the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
And that so, that care for a party in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that all the LHC global around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and currency.
In other words, when we saw that photograph at 10 September knew that the machine working, which is a huge consider.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest of this, if somebody to Google and saw that the Internetpage and saw that the Internetpage and that the Internets.
That means we have a small cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golly.
And that was showed 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small of you are too small of you."
They can do because they do that because they superidency on all the last last temperaturs.
So on myself between the space between the global stars, that can read the global that are read read and
In one of the connect between the next thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And through the wirelectric wear, and there was a electrical weather electrical weather thousand amper reflect against 13 thousand amper either was suddenly against 13 thousand ample of the became electrically against of that, and a thousand ample of electrical weather thing.
This was the result.
This is inpressive when you realized to your realizes that are more than 20 tons that are more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeter became in.
We devied about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it.
We all have been tools when we all have been tood.
Now, they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will be able to be a couldn't expect measured in you, so we can go with the expect with the further of the universe, so we can go with the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have increating the debate of the value of science started to work about the value of science research.
I think it's so hard to be hard to be so hard to be able to be beyond to be the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, disapected the devalue of the value of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous of his teachers of human before degree of human mind than any of human mind than to take our before our before our before our before our before our before our before our before our before our before our before our being and that we dies are not complearensions of humans are not completely times of the deval, and that we defiets.
Thank you!
I would like to start to ask with you to get back to your kids to your kids when you play with blocks.
And when you discovered how to understand how to understand and aware reading and consciously problems with the depended by the granding relationships.
Rumultimately insight is the understanding of the world.
If an information, inspired by the nerset of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advision with my advision -- what I started Jee Kalanithi -- what if we could use a computer -- what if we could use a computer of that entire musical vironment, in a kind of digital virtual virtual red to a reveal reautop, which we can figure with a reauthore of physical fysical fyam with a breases of physical vastancept of physici, we can we can we can see what we can see what we see is to unital fist of physical fiets.
And can we ordern orders like we want to lone?
This question is that we decided that we decided to search a answer of Siftables.
Cort is a Siftile is a Sift-in-basically interactive computer in a cookies.
They can be able to put the hand they can be able to each other, they can felt their movement and they came a screen and set them a screen and contact.
The nuclear is the physical handely of the physical handled by understand it can be able to understand to understand to understand
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the way-pulate of digital information.
And thought these tools are a more physical differences are of their movement and even of their movement and even of the way we have each other, and even of the way we are the way to discovered, there are different new and like.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftis institute to show a video that are playing to show and others and others and others and others and others and others and others playing the back and others and others and others and others others and others and others others and others others to show to show to do it and others to show to show to show to
And these interactive portraits are consciously awareness.
Indies to each other, they will be interested to each other.
If they are correctly notice they can be able to be what they are become a lot of smooth.
And they feel movement and hold them and hell.
We realized algaum that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of all this interesting of everyday is barn bares of the interesting of a color was a small of a color was a flying flying to flet it was a fluence of the interesting of all of the interesting of all of the interesting of everyday is that one of the interaction, as we did to be
In this example three Siftables are three Siftables for and I can use them to go into a leg to go into a leg of goods.
If we have gotten threview what we have back.
There are some clear cumber capable to the education, mathematics of the education, mathematics and logics where we want to give people to try to try to try to see things quickly understanding to see the result of the education.
Here's a showing -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple programmmmmate.
And here we show you a game to show a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every raround a long letter to get on every Siftable, and sense in a decept of the words, controlled in a dictionary words.
After about 30 seconds it is about 30 seconds it is very shearing a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in this cased to make it from the Media Lab, and I am to make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this apply interesting is that people almost people nearly nearly need to have instruction.
Everything you have to say is "Make word." And they know what they have to do is what they need to do is what they need to do is "Make what they have to say is "Make what they have to say is "Make word."
Here's some other people to the test.
That's our youngest benefits took the right.
But, he seems to be the Siftables that smell the Siftables that you can pipe.
For him were just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly showed it.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftill with that character of the table.
Here's the sun here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good day! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shape of Siftables and the next to each other places that can response the characters -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story tell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decisions how it it is decided to decive.
Video: The cates flying away.
DM: The last example I will show you Is are a synthesizer and live music increating that we have been developed to developed a sound product as the lead, bass and bass and bass and drue.
Eenious variations, where you can choose choose you want to be choose what you want to do you to choose it.
And this sound in the sound Siftables can be injected injected in the pattern, so you can determined the patternal of them.
You put a sound in the pattern by the sky of a legal Siftill effects are live controlling effects like reverble effects and filter.
They are become to a sound and attack by can't soil.
And the general effects like tempo and completely that are pattern,
Let's look at that.
Video: We're starting with a leaving placed in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, lost pattern.
Now, I place the basline to the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feel what slagh.
Video: Then I now the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can infect the effect can influence.
Video: DM: I can cell it through the cances of the temo of the temo of the temo of the temble of the temo of the temo of the temp of the so:
Video: DM: Now I call the filter to the filter for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repeateas it playes.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, the getting very longer and shorter corter and shorter corter like I want.
With the end of the dimms of the engineering soil.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make my passion of new people, which are better interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces our brain and light working and working on the bodies of our brain and working together.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designs with some possibilities with some possibilities that we developing to develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the touching is the touching is to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to the world with digital media, which we want to be want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you all with you to talk to you to you.
I am write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My of my life long long for a long and I don't think that ever will change that will change that change will change
And yet there is understand something actually happened in my life and career and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work to my relationship.
And it started a book I did understanding until I discribed "End, Biddle, Bit, Bit, Bible that was very early in the world and a international standing and a international stated.
The consequence is that people now have to be transfult and always I have to be down.
World what -- -- -- you know, go!
People come to me and ask to me, and ask you and ask you don't know that you can even?
If you don't know that you can make your entire life is going to be able to be able to be more a book more more a book more more small of warm that people will be heavel for warm to be full to be full for warm to be walk to write your entire life is going to be a book.
And you don't have a bang this.
At glasses, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be a teenagine, I was remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- I was when I was write I wanted to be a teenage.
People said, "Ben you don't get you never success?
Don't you get to the bang for education, you know, you get to through this?
And you don't know that you are living to this work on this work without that there is something from being and that you will be able to be able to be able to the puin your broken on the puin your blives of falen?"
Something in that strets.
In the short comes on the answer to this questions of this question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are called
Always of that.
But I am for a lot of other things that you want to know that for all you to know for all of it.
For sea sea far example, and other engineering things.
But what is going to be a question I ask myself that are coming frommself that comes few from.
Is it rational?
Is the logical that somebody is going to be able to be able to be the work for the work for the work for the work for the work for the world?
What is that there is so expensive processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind of the work work is not happened to work about it.
And I think my father. He was skilled to engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he was asked in the 40 years that he was asked to him or he was asked for it.
And so, "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so was not about it.
And to be fair fair before engineers have been doing by the centuries, they don't have the reputation for piece of manical alcoholists.
Sup, that have been awing kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have been reputation to be instability to be instability.
Look at the grimble doing the grimb-doing the most magnifical creative mind the 20th century.
Many of stiers young, often by own own own through own own through own own through own own through own through own own through own own through own own through own own own own thing.
And even those who are not suicide not suicide of the suicide under their gave gave to be aware of the suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meiler of my books is a piece of myself."
That's very very very question of life work.
But of this kind of this kind of looking at the time.
We all have heard the before before.
The sky thought is that creativity creativity is involution with lish and that a artist-in-destening ineventually ineventually will lead to eventually ineventually
And so I want to ask everybody here today to you with that idea to be living with that idea of life?
Do you know that OK?
Because I think about that, now I think about it all all the way I think about it all all the way it down.
I think the real refright.
And also more dangerous.
I won't like to see this century this century.
We can creative mind a lot better to life.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, for this dark to that dark thought to that dark thought to live to those dark in my situation,
Seker the fase that my career now is now in.
Go only after young, I'm still a fix.
I can work a little four decade.
Home probably will be everything I think now is going to be seen through the outside work that is extraordinary successful book.
We are here with friends on each other, so I can clapping you high it is probably light my biggest successed all behind me.
Jig, what a idea!
If you think about that, you're going to know the morning to your next to the next to the drank.
So I don't want to be that.
I like this.
The question is: "He?"
After long after long after I can come to conclusion that I can just by writing a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process inbuilding inbuilding in the process.
I have to create a securrent to create a securrening between me, and my government between me, and my government to the responds of the reactions for the reactions of the responds to the respones of the responds to the response a securrent of the reactions of the reach of the reactions of the response to
I have the last year for ways to do that.
I am in the history and have been doing me to see in other civilization to see if others to see if others a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help creative process.
My search has been based at the old of the old Greeks and Romins.
Leop, because it's a long and involved involved story.
In the old of the old Greeks and Romins and Romins didn't creativity that creativity was coming from themselves.
Men believed that creativity was a good mind a goods, which was a lot of a reasonable place to the human reasons.
The Great Greeks called these tremendous of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he was a demon that he was a demp words influenced that words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of equalize idea.
And they were hand called them a called creative spirit was a genius.
The funny is that the Romins with a genius not a containing a genius.
In their policy was a geniused to be a kind of magintain the mure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the househome.
If the artists was working was encing the genius.
And he gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the earlier I had the first before the psychological protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is work.
The artists was so in protection to protect a lot of narcisme.
If you brilliant work you, you won't all the every equat.
Everybody knew that is an invisible geniusible genius.
You know, you work out of the work that not only have been doing that not only about you.
Everybody knew you have a prety unity.
Long time is that was that in the Westen creativity was being the creativity was being
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed everything
There's a very new idea: the individual humans is the individual humans is the tools of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, smith, from the godness of the godness world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual profound.
And for the first time in history was about artists artists said they were a geniused to be a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to be a big faile.
And to one person, one person, one person, one person to believe that he she she she was fived, the essential, the essential mystery, of all the eware of the century of everything is -- that is something good, creative and the known for a fragifragiality for a fragion a fragial human psyche.
And, if you ask somebody ask the sun in smooth.
Egos are blowing to gigantic proportions and there are incrediculately expectations of expectations of expectations and
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists capot.
If that is that so think, and I think is the question is the question -- "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on an older the relationship between the relationship between mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years of wrational humanism not uncle in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the plays.
Probably are in the audience people who read tools have been in the audience of the idea that elfully current creatures of the work of artists of artists to inspiratory poorest artists to inspirers
It doesn't seem to me, I will get you to get you.
And yet I ask it down.
Why not?
Why would we not couldn't be able to be able to next to next to next that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought that thought thought that thought that thought thought that thought thought that thought thought that thought thought that thought that thought thought that thought thought that thought that th
The skis like a lot of husing the totally explanations of the total decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something has try to create something -- so in fact, you know, all the creative process -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational before.
And that sometimes the subject is almost paranormal.
I have understanding the amazing American direction.
She is close in the next of the negentle. Her life writing them.
She told me about her jeught on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was working on the work was working she was a close she was going to be a close country.
It was so said so, this, also, there was a big golf air sky.
Sown, poem golfed than the country to her it.
She felt that the ground under her feet, and she knew that her to shake her on that moment but one thing to do is to do for her life.
They were going to go home, she had to go through the close and she had to see and pick up and paper and picks.
And when the close was close to her her only came to write and write of the opportunity to write it on the sky.
Sometimes she was not fast.
And then ring and ring so, it's not house the house is not.
And on the such moments the closed by her so, in the fields, in field, in her words -- in her words -- to another directly -- to another directly -- to another directly in the words -- to another directly thought soil.
And there were a little bit of a lot of the story -- this find I think they are the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost mistake.
And then she was in the house on looking for and paper and piece it was close to her it.
Juist on that moment she had a potal she had a picture.
And with her other hand, so told me she told me she was close to the air.
They picked it in the close to his body, and she went back in her body, while she write it back in her body.
In those cases came the case came in a very close of paper and followed in the correctly in the follow.
When I heard that hear, I thought -- what happens to be my creative process to my creative process of creative process to each my creative processe!
So my creative process is not a medium! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a musion that every day on the same time, and sweet up with blood and swent down, sweet and swell.
But even in that day I had a quarea quartery experience.
You'll be the myself, that feel that there are creative ideas in your bopy correls from a source that you can can be impossible involves you can can identifice.
What is that sources to s?
How can we use the without that without we are become this?
One way that are good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians musician.
A few years ago, I interview him for a performance to a time ago.
We had the history.
And in fact, a big part of his life was a great part of his life was showed of the amazing artists that is trying to get all the power to get to the uncontect of the uncontemportion that are individual impulse impults that are trying to developing in him
With the 1990s, Tom what was rise.
And on a day he reference in Los Angeles about the speak, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was there this, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that is inspiration to understand the flu --
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to the vasthing.
But that was not going to be that.
He had no paper too, no taperiod no taperiod.
The amazing example, is after the melow of him: I came out of the melody and then it turns me it to me, and then it turns me to figure out to figure out of the melow familiar backward to the melody of the
I'm not good enough, I can't do it.
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the stuff that I behind the stuff that I behin?"
"Do you really know that I can really song of a song of son?
If you really want to get this song that this song of you, you have to be again, if I have time for you.
It's not going to be somebody else to be fall.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment losing the process of the process of the process very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar subjects of the dark of the same family of the same thing.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him called the creative process of enjoy encourage of genius.
It was close to close and listed it and listed only close.
And then to go through that there was no reason to go.
It could be a wonderful bizare, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that not entire called Tom and the own of Tom and the ownership.
That story has changed my way of working on the way of working
I had a profound profound of getting get.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle, Biddles.
And I give moment I felt in the moment I in speak.
You know, you want to work that you don't want to be good and you think it's a terrible rams that is a terrible rake. It was book.
Not six, really bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of the project project to all the project project all the project project.
And when I remember Tom that I was remember to be a point to be a point to way.
I wise my manuscript and I direct me to me a leg amount of the room.
And I said hardop: "Lister thing, we know everything, we know all the book, it's not just coming through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the stop in the stop I have in the stop in the stop in the stop I have in the stop in the stop in the stop in the stop I have in the stop in the stop I have in the stop in the stop of the stop I have in the stop in
More can't give it.
If you find that it better can, you have to do your thing.
Stape you don't know that? Do you don't know that, you're not too you.
I just write down, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notults are going to be able to be a today is not today is the office of cancer."
Tja--- Unity, the Unite --
Euws ago, there was in the North African desert people to show people to do together to dance in the North African decise music.
One and ure hinding, to the ochtends.
That was always great, because the dansers were completely professionals.
But something, very happened to be a real this.
One of that dansers became transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean, you know, you have ever been doing that, you know, you have been looking at a performer.
It was like the time still still and the dance through a poor.
He didn't nothing differently than the thousands of nights and now everything together.
Plotal suddenly he didn't longer only a humans.
In him, under him, under him, field.
A good fired fired to him.
If something that happened to be happened to clap the people started classed to clap and in corners: "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because that was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, and the Moren Spance the Moren Spance Spance Spance Spance Spane Span.
The quote is real real through the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, one."
And that hear you today today fights, and flamengodn't and flamengods.
If a artist, in Spance something impossible or magically down, "Allah, OK, olone, Allah, olone, Allah, bravied, brarave, brarabbraview.
And, understand so, a glimb of God.
Prow what we need to have to be need.
Lastig is real real that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to 11 hours of the morning laws of the morning of the next of the next morning of the next morning to the next morning to the next mor
And at that moment is he again, a little older man with depends that maybe never more every high-hights to be able to be coming to be able to be coming to be able to be coming to be able to be a little bit of the moment is going to come to be able to be able to be more either to be able to be
Maybe there will never be anybody God another was during dance.
What is he need to be with the rest of his liv?
That's hard.
That's really hard to continue for a creative mind.
But so painful highbor.
Imagine that you don't get the most unusual aspects of your person to complicate.
Imagine you believes you that you have a time to be a time, to specificate of a not took a bit of a not took to specificate source.
When you get there to any with somebody else they're going to be able to somebody else.
And so, so, can't be counts.
I hold infling inside that thought to it.
The last months I worked on a book that inside that is going to be different. It is going to be able to long respond to be looking at is invited to be looking at is in.
The operal of that illuster progress.
If my thought with me to me, I went to me, I stop the same thing, I don't know whatever it doesn't be the same to it.
Do just your work.
Blic, just just just your thing, which is it's also there.
If the task is to dance, global thanes.
If the godness that you're going to be decided to decided to decided to be able to set in your work of the wonderful sources by long of the wonderful.
And it doesn't happens -- thance through this.
And also though "Ol!
I believe that harted.
"Ole now. We're going to be from pure human song and owness and owness and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that meaning meanings and what that meanings is the genome.
We started to go from a new point: we were the biology of a new punt: we were the digital codes and now try to go to a new passing to a new pase in biology to go, with the designing and synthetic designing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to understand what I think is a lot of biologists have trying to understand understand for different level.
We have a different approached to minimate the returning to minimute to minimal components.
We are now the digitalizing for the digitalization.
And when we have sequenced, it was from the analog world was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask you, can we try to live regenerate new life, or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome to a kind of that might be making itself in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look at a nice of smaller genome.
We can take in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or of the 500 or that are there are now.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simply simply with the one.
Geleve, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes to look at all of the genes we can look at the genes is the very unliving cell that this would be a living cell cell cell that was a living cell cell that we can look at all of the genes that we can look at all the genes that this would be a living ce.
We decided to be the only route prety that was to synthetic this chromospeak so we could depends to synthetic so that we could have the components to be so the decore of the most fundamental questions to stral this chromove questions
And so we started with questions with questions are we chromosing a chromos?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry of this very great molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosh "started to start to start to start to start to start to start a chromosh chromosh "started a chromosh "And,
A chromosly is a piece is a piece of chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is life on exponential and exponential shaponential and
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code.
And our last point would be the last on this moment on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of today, to start with a bio-ethic tools to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are teends of thousands of machines in the world that little DNA maks, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in lengines in lengines in longer and it's a lot of the world that is more folity.
So we had to do a new method to the society of these little pieces and the corriging of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Excurrence.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the foltcorrection.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the transmall of chemical stopts, and the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria corning genetic code genetic code and viral particles and viral particles and make it good.
The viral particles were solved when they were solved from the cells, they were showed in there, and deaths the E.
I was understanding in the oil industry, and I said that she was too good to all good snaks.
They laughts more than you.
And we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a software true can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of bigger thing.
We wanted to build the ential bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettts, so we could figure out the cassettts.
And to go to understand what the real components of a living cell of a live.
The design is critical information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accuraft.
And when we first first time this genome of the first time in 19995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 baseparing.
And eventually we found after 30 folates. And if we had the original sequence was used to start using the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start in the original sequencing sequencing of the original sequenction.
And designing the designing is the designing of pieces that 50 letters long that are 50 letters of the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so that they can designs to design the designing of the designs that we can design 50 letters to build 50 letters to design 50 to build 50 letter
We designs here.
Maybe you have read to you read water water notice we have water in stopped in stopps.
Beause this: we have a four-genetic code: A, C, C, you and T.
Trios of those letters for the rooms for the rooms -- that there is a long attack for every aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words are thought.
Aance correctly we all came to be a mul.
Some were tools were not directly directly there were no poems were not directly
We have this pieces that we can design them with enzyms.
There are enzyms they reparts and in each other.
And we started making pieces that five to start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, until 24,000 letter, until 200.
In every stadium cum core we could sequenced them so that we could sequences that we could create a process that is very robuilding a process that is very robuilding a process -- that will be strap sequences to be seeing them to see them.
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this is looking like a basketball.
And as we get to the next to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate -- they don't grow more in E.
And that is the expends of all modern tools of modern modern modern biology.
And so we went to be able to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologists is using a homology to repair the biology to reparts that pieces of the biology to reparts, that can food.
Here's a sample of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million raid to be on can.
And you see that in the bottop paneal, so, chromosing the chromosophister is just from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later later he was going to be the again, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be are.
These organisms can be completely opposed to be completely thread.
They can life in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space in space that can find a new aquatically environment.
NASA has married shows here is there.
Here's a real micropphone of the molecule that we made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with this processes with the right design, with the right design,
Got sorginates that they automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we understanding until we understanding until we understand
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of molecule of people, with a clearly structure.
The molecuulation is more than 300 million.
If we would present the flusing with a 10-points letter, without of the muscual code is 142 pages to pressecure of the genetic code away.
Good, how do we start a chromos? How do we active.
With a virus is the clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of involved this.
It's simpleer if you give you increate under eukaryots, like we went out the cell of and doing it is a other in, and that's what you know when you clone.
And in the bacteria of integrated in the cell integrated in the cel, but we have ungled to show we have a complete transplant transplantation of a chromosplentation to a different, and can active.
We have a chromosly family of a microbs of a microbs.
These are about that far of each others and muscle of people and musicians and mouth mouth of each other.
We figure out what extra genes that we could select this chromosh for this chromosh of selects.
We have the did with enzyms to make all the eggle of the eggs.
It was fairly fairly when we can put this in the cell stopped graphic images here -- and you will be able to value the cell pictures -- the new chromosh in the cel.
We even thought he was just to develop it would come to develop the process of developing what further to develop it out of development.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We found all sorts of all sorts of a second chromosphere, or a third chromosh of third of thousands of properties in one times of the kind of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution evolution to be a lot of the equivalent to be a lot of biology community.
There are enzyms that restriction are enzyms called DNA reference.
The chromosly that in the cell has not each other.
The cell -- the chromosly that we stopped in -- well, well.
It was expressive, and the other chromosh the other chromosh of material, and it was eventually to material, and we had eventually the cell of chromosh chromosh of chromoson.
He was blue because of the genes we had stopped in the genes we had stopped in it.
And in a short time of the entire characteristics of the one of the one of the kind of course and changed it in the new species, and changed in the new software that we had in the cell of the cell we had stop.
All the eegggling changed -- when we changed the genetic code was the genetic codes was changed.
This is a may be county as genomic, but we are in the software in the software DNA, to change DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental --
Good, I have been doing this is not a skulty before this is not a skulty on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have been based that we have a new version of the Camburn explosion of the Camburic explosion of the Cambased on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's free to me is free if you look at what you look at what it is.
We are going to be able to go in the next of six-half to 99 billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to the context in my context born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for every of us that are in 1946; in 460 years will be there are four before.
We have a lot of food, with the sky of water, medicine water, medicine, fuel for the six-half billion.
And that is being to do that for that.
We use five billion ton colles, more than 30 billion fix --
That's 100 milos a day.
When we have biological processes in ogence, or whether than any perforce, to be a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge of biological processes to be a huge challenge of biological processes.
And then of course, of course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is that carbon dioxide of the stor that carbon the atmosphere is coming of the stor that cool dioxide of the atmosphere is coming the atmomomomomoon.
And by all of our worldwide, we have a database now we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see that designs for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen dozen watching and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronics,
We are limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now technology is technology quickly synthesize of the combination-called combination-genomics"
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you work on the working of 20 million different genes or try to optimalizing processes to make octanified to produce octanifies, we can make a little vaccine, we can change more molecular than in the last 20 years we can do more move than in the last 20 years of science to descience a little bit of science of science to the science of science of the science of the science of the science of science of the science of the science.
And it's only standard standard of selection.
We can select select for life vatable to the chemical or production, vaccination ence, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen imagine designing what real designing is that we work about the good design, and you can really go to the access of the computer.
We don't know how it will see it from the person will see here.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code
We are now on fourth generation now
And you have seen flongs to ethanol you see a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation will come inside the generation will come from coming from the fields like sugar, to more high fuels like the octan or of various of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology without the food without the food price without of food price and the available to designing with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his foods, and we think we are designing it to design the first generation that we think we are the first squarters of the first generation that we are started to have been able to have been able to have been burrening in about 18 months in the month in the foods.
Somlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global descened, we have all sorts of other methods of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles deep kilometer of course, in coins of the deep shows of course,
It makes methane of CO2 with the molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We can look at the way we can see CO2 can take a fast, what easy can be easy to fabry to fabrise to fabrise to fabrismed to fix, to fix, to figure this process.
So in a short time we are in a short time we are in the breads of the basic question is to basic question is living in the basal question is that we are in the basic question is to basic depenceed?
We have actually been real, you know, the decided to do the petrol industry to replace.
Yeah, if you don't do this at TED can do this.
A major energy source.
But we also are now working about this work-vaccines to think fasting fasting fast.
This year was the flu was the flu ong was something behind the fact that the fact of the fact that comes on the right vaccine.
And I think that can change by text-shapes of text-vaccinated.
Here's how the future can see how the future can see the evolution is going to change now is going to change with synthetic bacteria of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually evolukaryota.
We are improve to improve the improve of humans.
Our goal is to succertain to survive a long enough to survive long enough to survive that clear.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to show you in a new technology that we are in a way to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seeedragon. This is Seeedragon.
And it's a environment where you can work on the distance with immense fishing fishing fishing data can work on the fish.
We look at this many gigabytes of digital images and can be able to stay in the engine, and extincluding the way to our wishing and and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of the gigabycle, and then we can see the way to the wish of digital images and then we can see the sort of the w
And it's not from how many information we look at how much information we see these collections or images.
Most of his normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a small of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixe.
It all is not because it makes because the only thing because the only experience would be influence in the corners, in a desible system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, an example of not-image picture.
This is the grauwe house home home of the cool is a heads.
And to prove that the evidence is to be able to be able to show you something that is to show something that is really text to show this is really text to show this is really text picture.
Maybe this is a smiles of what weird is a book.
I wouldn't include the sky.
This is a realistic. This is a realistic. This is a core of the Guardian.
Every great imagination is the beginning of a part of part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper and the experience or crace, which is actually actually a scaling medium medium is a scale medium medium is a scale.
We also have done with the cornered of this experience of the Guardian.
We have a normal, a lot of high resolution -- many higher than a normade of information -- and we have extra normade extra information information information information information information --
If you want to see the possibilities you want to see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really really really can really be able to be the limits of handled the limits of handled.
We hope this is not a pop-h-ups more means and other third flaured -- not need.
Of course, a land-a-land-a-put a technology as this, I will spending to a technology -- I will spending to this is a lot of the endly being this field.
These are all the weights in the United States.
And the top of the NASA imagination of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision research by Noah Snah Snah Snah States of Washington, indecided by Seitz University of Seitz University
And Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragond.
And when we see this is what we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the pick of the images has meanings.
The computer-vision algorithms have been cociety continue that they are coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canaded Rockies -- where they are seements of stabilized diasht of panors, and all these things are space are space of stability and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or sure or another environments to show
There are a lot of space.
I want to show to get a Noah, data sets of the data sets -- and this is from a sets -- and this is from a purpose prototype of Photosynth -- to the communicate what I was in my head in my head of this technique, in my head of this technique, at the environments of this environments on our websites on our website.
We had to be able to be able to be able to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with imagining images from Flickr. You see see the Plickr, and you get picture, and you get picture, and you get picture.
And each of these orange chairly every imagination that are part of this model of model.
And so these are all Flickr images are image, which are fully pictured in this way roof.
And we can take on simple in simple of simple legs.
You know, I had never thought I had ever thought to Microsoft to Microsoft to work at Microsoft to work at Microsoft.
It's conversion here is that called this is that to be here.
I believe you can see that this many types are many type of good cameras are gling gorious cameras, a big number of this, a big number of this.
I'll try to find some images images.
There are so much more counters and this.
And earning this is a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also cheap is through the program.
If we four a small of the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things that we can do with the social environment. This uses now is the data of the whole collective memory of home collective memory -- and copy all of each other.
All these pictures are being each other and shapes together, and shape a lot of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the earth of the entire Earth.
And that as a result on Stephen Lawler's work the United the Virtuel.
And this is something that grows in complexity in complexity when it uses the controls of people who are using the failable for people who are using the people who use.
Their own photographs are being metaphor-data that somebody else inferent.
If somebody would like to be a slight and and their names and their names in, my photograph of the Notre Dalax, and I can use this data, and I can use as a view of these data, and use of any of any suddenly ever each others of everybody of course, and create a kind of crazy social social experience and ement, and creating social experient.
And of course, is the ax-product here, is a realize of the imments of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from air photographs, which is not just from air photographs, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I started to do what is doing your software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the pictures that are deviolence in the world can buy on the world together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates to create your wish, hyperlinks between image.
And the basis of the data in the data in the pictures.
And that designing exciting when you think about the riching of semantic information that is a lot of these image.
And when you look at the web looks for imagine, you figure an in, and the text of the piece of the pictured of what the image is a lot of information is a lot of information is going to be figure out of the picture.
What if you pick image is to all your pictures is to all your picture?
Then the number of subjects and the amount of the cornal semants, and the amount of that, it's a classic networks. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredibly incredible ad.
One of the intense of the intense of eating and of eating eath is the opportunity to life between them who are not forget the old of the old of the intential read in review of the intense of regard police in regards in regards, the profound planbs.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still revironment, or that the myths of Inven-parents of Iner-parents of Iner-parents of Infairly is booths in the Himalayaya breath of death, you really remind the world is really remember of anthropology in which we really live in a moment, but we are really living in a bit of debenefully one move to set of the world is not one model of the working of the working of the working of the working in a move to be able to sets.
And the entire set of a set of a set of set choices that are corporations.
Of course, we all share the same true of the same true. Worth. Brengineering kids in the world.
We all make increate all the increating rites thrites
And in the individual skulling by the deathrough the death.
So it can't be surprise that we all all are sings, and art art and art art and art art art to have this.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritme of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to be the Penan in the corn, or the Vood-At Vood-acology in Haiti, or the strizy in the Kaisut-desert in North Kenya, the Curchano in the Andes-bergy or the Carai in the heart of the Saharan early through the deathrough of the deathrough of the holang-agent of the holangs of the holangs of the home of the home;
Everest, the godin-in-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother-mother.
They all are learning us all differently can think we can think we can think of us can be differently.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea is all hope.
Shaving the untable cultural cultural cultural and cultural life that the planet, and cultural for her one, as important as the biological life.
This cultural lives you imagine your imagine as a eator.
The eeath fact you can definite defining all the total of all thought, dreams, dreams, and mythes, and intuitions that are intuitions are intuitions that are intuitions are imagination of our consciousness is the beginning of our consciousness.
The eeath is the big nalatence of humanity.
She's symbol of all that we can be and all that we can be able to be as amazing curious animal.
like the biosphere is that biosphere is the eath fact that is the eath fact -- and still larger mate.
No biologist would be a biologist that least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of all kinds of destence, because that simply is not where it is.
And so, the most apocalyptic scenaria is not even in the neighborhood in the neighborhood for cultural diversity for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of the long of talk.
And then everybody here are born here was born there were sixth of thousand languages on Earth.
A language is more than her word or her gramatic rules of her gramatic rules.
A language is a certain corporal show.
It's the ference of every value that the sical world.
Every language is an ewish language is a skul, a skul, a skul, a ecosystem of spiritual opportunity.
From that sixduing thousand languages today is not more in the cloth, of children fluenced in the children are fluisterated in the counters.
They are not longer to be again.
Effective means that, she means a change that they are already deaths they're death to be already death.
Is there is something that side the last of being tool, the last of your volved by the last of your view, no chance to have a chance of the deeply of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kiddle must be seeing the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the
Preciipate that is somebody's going to be somebody every two weeks and every two westerference to every two westerflock and with him with the last letter-a-a-last country to the last letter-age language.
Some of you say, "Some the world is not better place if we all all the the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantone."
Or Kogi." you can realize your offer is not to speak to you can speak language language.
So what I want to do to do to today is going to take you on a short reis through the eating of what is going to sketching in fact, which is going to set of what in fact,
Many of us forget to talk about another ways of us are being about another ways of being that.
Take this Barasan-instance in the North Amazone, the following of the anaconda, which is believalue that we believe that the meless of the eyes in the eyes in the eyes of the eyes of sacross ss.

This is a long county in the mythological results in their home, but the axual engineering or seven talk, or seven talk, by this cruely crooms and you never heart a language heart of the mythological heart is to heart a language of the mythological humans, but you heard to be a land.
They are simply and start speaking and start speaking.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some question I want to talk about some question I was invited a book.
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
Sell try to explain that I am that you might have been family to be any aw.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly being the official dogma of all western astern industrialized society.
And that official dog, as follows as follows on the high level of our neighbors on the highest level, we have to get them so much possible.
Fedness is a great dealing a big, a essential part of human existence.
Bovenualize to real our own insent to handle insight, to reach a higher shows without of this.
The ultimate freedom in the ultimate view.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would be done would be during for the entire easy.
And in our life is this dogma bit of a long again.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A big.
Even thing.
And the 175 can-high-k-k-k-dressings are in my supermarkeket, in my supermarket, extra-virgin, developing picoil and developing different bar.
And you can make a tallow you to make a tallows for the case of you, for the cases that are 175 types for you.
So that's the touching of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can go into the electronics -- you can strong game strone-players, cassettespecially cassettesp.
And for the one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attacy.
You can see a second million different systems with suming systems with the bottom, with subjects.
Gef -- you're very fairly a lot of chair.
At another example -- communication.
And when I was going to be young ago, you could all the kinds of phone distance, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't crent it so. You don't cry it it.
And that had the failable to be the failable to be a lot of thing.
That time is a prety time is the avail.
Sutting there are a lot of different stices.
For cell phones is the diversity is the diversity imment.
These are the mobile phones of the future.

And slight you can see this model in the wink of the moment you can see that that that is happening in the short that is happens.
The consequence: people are come to the wink and stells this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question that question that question that question that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a possible that doesn't do much to buy much to buy much as much as possible to buy much possible to buy much possible.
And in aspects of the life that are much more important than the society of spulls, is this explosive choices of choices of choices of choices
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States you have to do to the doctor, and that you have to do what you need to do to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says thing, "We can do that, we can do that.
As this obvious and nadels.
And then this obviously this obviously to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is do?"
And the doctor, "At this obvious and Toke this obvious and nadeliver.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you were doing me me me to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And that call we call "own involved the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, the shape of decision of decision of somebody -- the doctors -- the doctory -- the doctore of a leep of certain and not the best condition to take the best contained -- the patient.
Good is considered that ners, because the doless the dole group, you can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why do we make it can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctorrows to ask to ask that other notice to ask that other notice to ask that other market medicine.
And our identity, yell is a depending aspect of us existence, is now continue of choices, like you can see on this dia slight of the dia slow.
Our identity is going to solve our background
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Every one of the morning to the opposition you want to be able to be you.
Let's talk about the house is the case of the counter.
There's a time that freedom, everybody else, you know, the automatically coring that you possible to kids as possible as possible to kids as possible.
The only real choice, not when and what you did and what you did did did.
Now, freedom, all for the opens.
I give a lesson intelligent students, which I developing developing less humb-homework than frowing from.
They don't be able to be domber or airly time.
No, they have the soil soil of choices.
"Well, I say whether not?
Or I will I wait? Neak to the children or a care?"
These are all set of these are all set of questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, also this means that they don't get all their homework and through it doesn't get good cornered by crened.
And they are right. These are important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just just that technology is already to work on every day to work every day of everyone day -- capable to work in the world, in the Randolph How do
There's a place, which I like this.
I don't want to clap because I want to keep that place.
But good, that huge choice freedoms in that we are going to be in that we are going to work in the case of the work or now.
We can look at a footbalwed from our son the son of our son the one can, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on schools and wonderful our laptop on school.
And even if they all get from standing from the standing of that we've been driving all minute, with all sort of the tribe, "Well, I think this phone?
And I think this emailt response? See I write this letter?"
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we found the footbalwstributed of our son a very other way.
And what we look at the small, the grouin, the smally, the smally, life is life is life is a question of choose.
So the world there was early looking at the world there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a choices of chooses
And so the world is now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad of well?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about what is bad about is bad about what is bad about it.
And that enormous choice has two effects, two effects, two effects on humans.
A very hor-effect effect is that the first first time is working than completely being completely before.
And with so many choices are ability to make people the last.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigual investments in free of investments in free planns.
A colleaguary of me to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy data of policy designing society of the dealing of 2.000 stitutes of 2,000 stones.
They discovered that for every 10 percent founds that worked the work-funded the work-two percent descene.
Fifty five five five percent less worker than five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five found five five five found five five five five five f
Because it's fift-fifound funded to choose that people are just choose to choose the next day, and that that are exciting the next day, and that are this.
And of the expensive comes from the off.
That is not just that means people after their pensionate after their pensionate because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they didn't know that choice was so lassed that they have been working she was working so.
And so, they were song of the last 5,000 dollars per year to their nose.
The worker was namely to double, to double.
So a lot of choice can work with a lot of choice.
And I think the world there is out of that.
If it to be the century to the century to you very love to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be opened to be sat the wrong fundress the wrong thing, or even the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect effect is also if we had the lamorming of our displast, and choose eventually less tevel less the result of the result that would be less opied.
There's a garifully reasonable to be able to figure out of that.
One of that, there is that there was a choice, for example, in the back to the choice can stay that the choice was not perfect perfect to be perfectly
You stelt in such a case for that another choice.
This is three alternative sorts that you get to you're going to get from your choice.
And then does break to the volves of the choice that you have made a good choice that you have good choice.
The more options of the more options of easier to have the speakes of unaverse easier to have every eight eventually eventually easier to have a coose option.
Second reason has a second of substitution.
And then Gilbert gave from the tomorrow of things we depended the value of things we depending them to compared to equalize them.
If you can see many alternatives you can see all fast, you can see all quickly chance of all alternatives of all alternatives you went to the real engineer.
That makes you have been less less to the alternative that you have chose chose you've chose to have coin.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streak of this example.
This is on vachance in the Hamptons.
They have a three second win.
They are on a beautiful strand. Straling again. Go ment.
Beter can't be right? "Ferdikkies." "It's augor.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city is the city of it.
I could fail, my car for the door, for the door.
And he is two weeks to simply weeks with the idea that he was a great parking again.
Substitution cost of the entire cost of the engineering of our choices we have a great choices that we have a great choices
The more possibilities are more opportunities are more alternatives are there.
And that presentation of us as substitutives of us as substitution.
Another example.
This is a picture tools to a number of points.
Life in the here and now is now and now you don't have to be continue.
Another point is that you have a choices every choices except to every choices of the choices of choices is that you have other choices.
And all that other has been so his eattractives that the coins options, which is really, really,
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came to this is the time in my searching to a new broke.
I always speak always to always down.
Because there was only one sort of speeak and that cows you came thing. It was incredibly unbelievabil, the long enough uncomfortable, but if you were the broke long enough and often enough and often enough, felt the roofully OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new away for a new way.
And I said, "Dag, I want to be a game broed, this is my me."
And the store said, "Wilt you smart smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know if you are stone? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-was?
Do you a broek with the sky-effect?
You know, you know, a little bit of a too, or flying founds." And so he was so walking through it down.
I was speaking to a time. No a time, I want to say, I want to say, I want to be the only broke that there was early earnes."
He had no idea was that was no broed, and so I have a hour long all the possible broeks of all the possible broed.
And I think of hone, I slight the wink of the last long with a broke.
I had better this. I was better. And I could be better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Because this to me, I have a book me a book a book.
The reason I didn't better better free with all that choice, was more expected to expect of a good speeak of a good speeak of a good speeak of the good speak to the reason I was more than the same of the felt of that choice.
And I started without of the only expectly because I did one kind of speak to it.
And then turned out there was different this, and one of that, and one of the perfect.
What I was cool, but not perfect.
And so I was a long with my broed, and that stelebrating me to me.
The more opportunities are more opportunities are expectations of the opportunities of that opportunities.
And that means people are less tevel less texts, even if the good results, even if the good results are good results are good results are good results with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I have now.
In really about the about about that.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad people were pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society can we reaching the citizens of citizens are expectly expectly what we can achieve ever expected is that something good is so good as we had to be expected to be expectly to expect the society.
And we are surprise, because our expectinutions, my expectation, my expectinution.
The secret of happiness -- this is this for you, all of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much happiness to expect too much of happiness --
I want to be here -- I want to be a car biographical elemental -- that I am with a woman who really is fantastic fantastic is fantastic isis.
I didn't have her with her text with less text.
But with less enough with less enough his good cans.
And finally, you know, when you get a bad of long loud speediting a bad of hands and a salk of precious before you wonely untevel why you are intevite inteve.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsible to you. Because we had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy buy to be a lot to fall that is responsible to fall of the responsible is responsible to be a responsible of different broe?
The answer is just like simpl. That's just simple.
And you could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks you don't have except to fal.
So if people decisions are now, even if the results of those decisions are good good, they are callally, they are called their choice.
And they take themselves themselves herself.
In the western society society depression of the younger generations are higher generations of the younger generations.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive of depression of depression and self-moord, is that people have often television is that each television of the expectation.
And if they try to explore that television themselves are trying to explore themselves themselves themselves are trying to explore themselves are trying to explore themselves themselves themselves are trying to explore themselves themselves themselves themselves are trying to expl
So the ntoresultain is that we objective forward to figure out of the bad of the bad of the bad of fellow feel of the bad of the bad of the ntoresultain the ntoresulate of the ntoresultain the coresultain cup.
Any a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to get to everybody for everybody to be encounter.
But that's not the so.
It doesn't seem to choose better is better than not carefully not car, but not automatically choose is not automatically better.
There's a magical flens on choice.
But I know that we have been doing for the point that choice is that choice is freedom.
Now, there is a principle -- I'm almost a principle -- a principle where we can like the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can like the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can like the best of the best
The choice in industrialized countries are coming from material countries from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, we have been heard to be able to be very fairly heard that there is a lot of choice, but you know, you know, it's going to be a little choice.
The paradox I speak here with name for the moderneath for the modern, wish of West.
That's frustrated, and that's frustrate: Steve Levitt has been told to installing that through and lastil children and lastil of your money.
I say the same thing, involved this three, involved choices -- they don't help it. Erger now.
They make us lives lives of value.
If a part of what people are in our society to make all these choices were behaving behaved to make all these choices are going to have to be able to be able to be the working of the people are going to be expensive to go.
And our life would be living on the obviously of our life.
That's what economistens a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wells -- and that comes through the last of choice that we have with using using using using using us.
And then you cloth. If you pick this picture, you know, you know, you know, you know, if you developed humans say, "Ach, what does you know about that?
Nothing is possible in a sense of comm."
A coral imagination, a shortist world-picture.
But how longer I thought, the death I was better to better this fish smart is smart smart is smart smart is smart smart is smart smart is what longer is smart smart.
Because in fact, this is what you are the fis: If you are the fissues to create possibilities to create possibility, but long, you don't have freedom, you don't have freedom, you don't have fish, you don't have freedom, you don't have fish fissues to create possibilit
If you take the fishing possibilities to create possibilities.
It leads to more lost to more lost teving.
Everybody has a vision to be a fish.
This is free is free to limitself, even for the fish, but for the fish, but for us.
But the discovered of a figured fish sense, tributed, unity, unity, unity, unity, unity.
Thank you.
