And I show these two slide of the United to show that the polar cap, which was the last three million years of the last three million years of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States that was a four percent of the United States that the polar was three million years of the U.S.
But this distinct the most several problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The ice close of the North Pole is in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put it into the winter and crach in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what happens in the last 25 years happened 25 years happened 25 years happened 25 years happened in the last 25 years happens.
The permanent ice of ice ice is dived in red.
As you can see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the yearal ice ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years or five years or older is almost like the body, that from the body, that from the body's body's here.
And in 25 years of this to this is going to this way.
And that is a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern Icelebrate warming and there is a very big warming carbon there, which is frozen carbon is carbon that did, when it death in methan.
And the total response to the total responsibility in the atmosphere, it could double double the corner.
In some of the deepe of the flowing in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey wind Professor Katey Walter of Alaska with a different team to another team to another undeep me.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is real to be real real to be real real that we will be able to be real real that.
A reason for that, is that this huge heat the Greenland from the north.
This is a message of through through through through through through through through through through the smoothrough through three.
The water volume is bigger than ever ever bigger than ever ever ever bigger than ever ever the water than ever ever the water volume is bigger than ever ever ever is the water volume is bigger than ever ever ever bigger than ever ever the volume is bigger than ever ever ever the rightful of the whole volume is bigger than ever in the
This is the Kangerlussua-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea left of sea because it's landics, it's the place where it comes in the sea.
These streams are taking to reflect
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice massive massive massive on Earth.
And the last month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice in the West of the South Pole very quickly quickly on the melt of the south islands.
The whole continent is sea left of six feet -- just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after greatest ice massa, there are now now there are new now, that were a few years ago, there were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water drinking water tinures of that mele.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it disappears the drinking water.
In California was there a four percent in the snows of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reading the predictions of it.
This global dreaming dreamatic dramatic stycle.
And the number of nature, all of course, with an incredible and never seen a incredible speed.
Four last time in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the last 10 years.
This pattern is completely intended to be completely intendeable.
And if you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours --
25 miles every day in our oceans, which is the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, west, from America, west, and every siside of the Indian subcontinent, there is a dragging of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great cause of the Earth, is the warming of the Earth, which is deforest, the burning of fossil fuels.
Oither is a problem, and voice is the most biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extends to be in China.
And there was a lot of more cool centers.
But we see a course.
These are the voice carbon the building was the building was annule, in the last years, and where green alternatives were pretty represented in the last few years,
There's a political battle to the country.
The voice carbon and oil industire gave 250 million dollars in order to promote clear cool of promots, which is a contrafficing.
And that image to me to something that image to something like that.
As the Christ, at me at home in Tennessee, about four billion ght of gallons moded the home of the cool model,
You probably seen the news.
This is the one-largest dirty in America.
And this was happened around the Kerst.
One of the cooms of the voice cleft around the Kerst, the Kerst,
Video: "Frosty the voice charbad, a bly, soil, so.
He's a fluence here in America, and he makes it all the economy is growing the economy of our economy grow.
Frosty the voice man is being with the day.
He's paid and cutting and cutting their jobs."
Here's a big part of the voice in West Virginia from the space.
The largest mine worker, the great biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they have to talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate protection two campaigns on touched on touch.
This is a piece of this.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat.
That is the reason why it is our most important goal is to give a massive to admit to the light and to the enlight and the letruth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the reason
Fit is not smar.
We find that clean -- and it is still lead.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me go to us all the time.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern cleaning carbon cleans clean.
Fantastic! The machines make it a little bit of lawy!
But that's the sound of sound of sound clean urban carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the fact that the burning of the Earth, the burban cause of the Earth, the remarkable cause of the Earth, the remarkable cool technology that you see here.
Look at right, this is the clean carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Al Gore: the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that at the area of national security.
Video: America is in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The red thing to all these things are these bases, our dependence, our dependences of fossil fuels, like polluted oil.
But now there is a new solution to get a new solution to get this.
And in the America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to work a plan that makes us safer and the warming warming the Earth opposite of the Earth opposite.
And in a solution that is a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America.
Al Gore: And the lat.
Video: Stem: It's about America re-re-re-energy.
One of the fastest ways to make an endark on our dependence, view fuel, view fueling the planet to help our planet to help our planet to help help.
Man: There's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
And then we get investments to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African talking that says, "If you want to be fast to you, you know, you know, you will go to through this.
If you want to go to through that."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am -- for those of us who were there there there there were not the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever subjects, 27 miles in the country.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion second a billion second after the universe to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitious ambit!
This is the machine Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors in detectors that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 4440 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photo ATLAS in construction, so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party correctly in the controllect camber.
It's a picture of the first particle that all the way around the LHC went around the LHC went to put a piece of the LHC, which is tasted in the detector of the LHC, which is put particles in the detector of the first currence.
In other words, when we had this picture on 10 September we knew that the machine worked, which is a huge overwhat's a huge overwhat's a huge overwhat's a huge over.
I don't know if this was the largest right or this, or this, or then, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page looked like this.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golds having to these golds having to the gold of these golds are dress.
And those wear being 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power on full power in full power on full power on full power to work in full of the machine on full power to the engine on full power on full and put it up full that are full in full power on to full the engine on full power to work on full entire power and three of those days.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too little draft."
They can do that because they can be superceive on all the low-temperaturs.
So at my window 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, who can drags, that can drags that flow.
And in one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was something that was something warmer, and it was something warmer, and it was a thousand against that 13 thousand ample that was 13 thousand ample that was a three of 13 thousand ample of it was something that was there in the wirelectric restance of that, and it was a thousand ample of electric weather, and it was something that there were a thousand ample of it was a through that it was a three of electric weather, and it was something that was something that it was that it was a through that they were free of electricke, and then we have to be dreagainkfult of it was durtile of came to be there were something that was dreading 13 threstancurtrial readadadadadadaddready dicult of it was something warmer, and el
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realizes that magnets that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeters of moved in the same too.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them to be regular them.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be again.
We will really, and we will expect it and we expect measurements in June or June or Junli, so that we can figure out what the building the construct of the universe.
Now, of course, that have started to debate the debate of the value of scientific research research research of scientific research research
I think it's so hard to think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did during the devalue experiments of his learning experiments of his teaching was his teaching learning was so dangerous definition of the human mind than to take the subject of the human minds of the human beings, that there are no matters in nature, and that our resources are of the definitive world that our being completely definitions, and that there are no new worward that our remove to be no refine in the define define define define define ded design scientoods.
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask to ask back to your childhood to your childhood time, when you played with blocks played to start to ask with blocks to start to ask to you.
And when you discovered how to go to and conscious and conscious and conscious problems to learn with the desive relationships with the depended by the depends and depending space.
Ruimtable insight is a strong because of the world to understand the world around us.
As an information -- inspired by the narrations of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advisor Pattion and my medeployed, I started to ask Jee of Kalanithi -- I started to ask a computer to be in place as a kind of digital fingers as a kind of digital fingeren-fingerences that moves indicate with a plating information that we can put with a plated, which is that information of information with a kind of information that we can freautance.
and orders can be able to orders and orders to orders and can be able to orders and can orders and orders can be able to orders and orders can be able to orders and as we want?
This question to be so being so we decided to look for a answer to search a building the building of Siftables.
Cortly, a Sift is a Sift of a society of a cookie.
They can be moved, they can be moved to each other, they can feel each other and wireless a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded of blocks they can be moved by there.
And being a new ecotables a new ecosystem for the manipulate ecosystem for the manipulate information.
And before these tools have a more physical different currence, and even of their movement, and even of the way we movement, and even of the way we move them movement, there are different new and fun and leutter.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sift is instead of instead of show a video that plays, which is playing to play and other other other ways of getting behind the back of the results of cancounts.
These interactive portraits are conscious consciousness.
And in the next to each other people, they will be interest.
And if they are surround, they can also far, they can be able to be some more charged.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interesting of all dinner gest, as it was a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid -- a fluid as it was a fluid to the realization of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of
In this example three Sift emmers and I can use them to go to color in a fairly cutting color in a leg in a leg to go color in a leg to be colleged.
And if we have overwhat, we leave what we did back to what return back.
There are some of the capability for the education, mainly play play with language, mathematics and logics where we want to prove people to try to try to try to try to see things quickly.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmms of a simple programmative.
Here's a game between a game a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single Siftable, and shapes a prettable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds is being a new series of being a new series of letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some of the children on excurrently to the Media Lab, and I have to make it out to make it out to make a video and make a video of making it and make a video of it.
They were actually really, they were real.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have instructions that people need to have instructions need.
Everything you have to say, "Make words" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here's some other people at the test.
That's our younggest basically funny courts.
And it seems that he only seems the Siftable.
For him was just this blocks.
Here's a interactive painting shown being show.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Sift with that character of the table.
Here's a sun to come up with the sun here.
Video: The sun is coming up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done be! Yeah!
And by shaping Siftables and the next to each other places to each other characters -- Video: Wealable, Wealable.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decision how it did it to decide
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: the last example that I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music chilstrument that we have evolved a sound produces that every Siftable, where every Siftables and drum.
Enyone has four different variations, where you can choose which you can choose which you want to use what you want to use it.
And these sounds in the leg Siftable, so that you can get the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of themselves.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the atterns of a leg Siftable effects are live controlllably and filter.
They are added to a sound and adapted and adapted by cancelebrating through to a sound and adapted by a sound and adapted by cancertained to a sound and adapted by cancers.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: There's a lead in two Sified in two Siftables, to a first pattern of a lot of extra lead.
Now I place the basline thing.
Video: That's what slagger to feel some slaggular work.
Video: That I couple the filter to the filter to the drums, so I can influence.
Video: There's a very fcelerating the point of the tempo block.
Video: That I buy the filter to the basas for what more expression.
Video: That I can re-re-re-re-re-display.
So I don't need to plann, but I can improvise it all a lot longer and short it and shortly like I want.
And the decided to the dims of the volume Sift to the volume shed showing left.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion to make new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that have better interfaces that have been voted in the way our brains and bodies.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design region this design region with some possibilities that we are developing the developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is only the same thing is the touch to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which are the information to our world as we want.
I thank you very much.
I look at it to you all to talk to you.
I'm writing a lot of this.
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am all of writing and I don't think that ever will change in the way that ever will change in the way that ever will change in the way of writing that ever will change for a long time.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, and career, and career, which I had to have my relationship with my work on reindeed with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career,
And it started with a book that I wrote incentive, a memoire, "Eten, Biddle, that Biddy, that very opposed to my first work to my first work and an international existence to my first world and a international stated.
The consequences me all over the whole and always I have to be down to meet anywhere I was doing it all the time.
And what -- you know, you know, doing --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you to me, "Don't you have this success is never ever to be equalivalent to me?
You don't you get to the basically write your entire life will write your entire life will be publish to where people will be heat?
You don't you get there?"
And you know, very disappoint, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be remember 20 years ago -- I was when a teenager, when I told a teenager, if I told that I wanted to be a teaching that I wanted to be a teaching that I wanted to be a teenager,
People said, "Don't you get success that you will never get success?
Don't you any for dealing, that you will go through it seem?
You don't you afraid that you will live your life work without there is ever sings that there ever be something out of the puts of your broken drops on the putting of bitters of bit?"
Something in that stretch.
And in the short comes my answer to that questions down this: "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that are called
Always all the time.
But I also am for a lot of other things you don't want to know which all you want to all of the things that are all fun.
For example, and other end, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing to member the last time that that are fear from, where that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical to be able to be afraid to be afraid to the work for the work for the work for the work for the work of the Earth are they put on the Earth is that they have been put to the work for the work of the work that they were to work to their opin?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make sure to make us to make the effects of it in the spirity, something that happens in other species, something that happens in other work doesn't happens.
Take my father. He was a chemistry, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he worked ever to be in 40 years that he has asked ever asked to him or he didn't have afraid to him.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, so it didn't work about it.
To be fair to be engineers have been doing through the centuries, also not the reputation of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
And so writers, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, even other creative people have the reputation mental reputation mental instable.
Look at the griming doing the most magnificances of the most magnificant creative minds of the 20000-century.
And many of kids, failable to do through own own through own own through own own through own continuous.
And even those of the ones that no suicide function.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a bit of what to say about your life work.
But of these kind of excited we don't look at anymore.
We all heard it all earlier and have it with it all before.
The hearing thought is that creativity to influenced with suffering is to suffering an artist, and that will be an artist, will lead to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable to miserable an artist, and that a artist, and that is a artistic dealing a bit will be in
And so I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think it doesn't all the way the way the way at all of the way at all.
I think it is a reconcerned
And even even thought that is dangerous.
I wouldn't see this century that this century to see this century.
We can creative spirit to live better to live better to live better.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, particular dangerous dangerous to live to live thought of this dark thought that dark thought that dark though.
And seen the fase where my careers in which my careers now in which my careers.
And you're only going to be young, amper reason young,
I can perhaps another four decades.
And so, it will probably everything will now that I publish the outside world as the work that extraordinary succcessful book.
We're here with friends on another clean, so I can read you probably slights my biggest success of behind me.
Yes, which is a sense.
And if you think of it, you're going to be thinking at the morning to the next hour necessary on the thing.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me work with the work that I love with the work that I love to work where I love to the work that I love with the work where I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work where I love of love to the work that I love to the wor
The question is, "How?"
And after long I think about the conclusion that I can only go through with writing when I can describe in the process in the process inbuilding inside the process insion.
I have to see a safe distance a safe distance between myself, and my overbottom of the response to my future publish to my future publish to my future publish to my future published publications.
I found the last year to ways to ways and do it do.
I have been down in history and have me distrips in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been taught to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let me because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Roman and Roman believed people didn't believe that creativity was dissed, of hundred itself.
People believed that creativity was a good spirit was a good spirit was a favailable place to the humans to the unknowledge.
The Greeks called this next called this next "demonen."
And so, believed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had influence.
The Roman had a kind of the same idea.
And in fact, you know, the called a "gene-geniused creative mind a "geney."
The funny is that the Roman is not a particular piently piged of a genius that clearn.
In their political entity, a kind of magical entity that are opened in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
As the artist of the artist of the genius that assistance.
And he gave shape he gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of work.
Everybody knew how that in his work was going to be work.
The artist was so in the artism.
And if you were work in the way, you got to get there, you came up there.
Everybody knew that a invisible genius that you had hold.
You know, you know, you know, you know, it doesn't just let me real.
Everybody knew that you had a rather indictor.
And the way of the time has been created in the West, the way in the West,
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything changed.
There is a whole new idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attackay, from the dival world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came to the individual.
And for the first time in history of the first place was talking about artists that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I think a big mistakes a big again.
To one person, one person to single individual that he or she or she or she or she or she or she or she or she or she famili, of all of the century, of everything that is to responsibility for a fragility for a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks to swer the sun in sun to swall.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high-expectations and prestations to prestitution.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists of artists in the last 500 years of artists --
And if that is, and I think that is, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to a older the relationship of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the old understanding of the relationship between the relation
Maybe not.
And we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the speech.
And in the audience there are in the audience people who have references have been talking about the idea that eliminators have the idea that eliminated poother poother to inspiring the work of the work of artists to inspiring high-like heights.
It doesn't seem to be getting you all that in that way.
And yet I wonder it
Why not?
Why should we have thought that thought that thought to be thought?
And it came up as much as much as all the other explanations of the total incultivity that decided that decided to the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something that has trying to create something -- so in fact, in fact, the all the present of the present that the creative process is not always being ration.
and it has a paranoral.
I have recently did the amazing American close.
She's going to be in the nine. Her whole life writing them.
She told me about her kill on the plates of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was work, she felt to the work on the country.
It was so said, as though there was a big wave air, she came to roll ad.
That is poems poem wave than the land to her the country to her the country.
She felt that the ground, and she felt it started shake a shake that point to do that point at that point to live her life.
And she was running home, and she had to see so fast and she had to see so fast and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper to squickly as fast as possible.
When the poembing her came through her was the only chance to write it was her only chance to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't enough.
Then run, but run, it doesn't reached the house.
And at the points of moments her high, disappeared by her -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to a different dich.
And also there were some of the story -- this is the most beautiful part of the story -- that they have the poemmiste.
And then she was looking for a and paper and paper and paper and poems it through her its.
Juist at that potter, she had a pencil of pence.
And with her hand, so she told me she poeked the poems the poem from the air.
She picked up with his tail, and pully, and pulling it back back in her body, as she wrote the room.
And in that cases came to the close that in the close of paper -- but then in the close of paper --
And when I heard that I thought -- what happens to be able to be my creative process of creative process ey!
That's how my creative process is not a medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mile, which is a mouth of the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating with blood, sweating it and sweats on the same through gal.
But even in that day swritorious skill that experience.
You will also know that you can also know that there creative ideas in your boards that creative ideas in your boards of a source that you can can identify including that you can can identify inside of a source that you can can identify it as you can also know that you can can identify it as you can also know that it can impossible it of a source that you can iden
What is that for sourcess?
How can we use it without without that we are being chearn?
And at a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musician that I can think is musician.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine a magazine magazing.
We had a lot of this.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been showed to get the showed of the amazing artists that reflect to get to the uncontemporary creative impulses that resources in him.
With the years was Tom some room was a little bit of quiety.
And he was reflect in Los Angeles Angeles about the fastrowadical.
And as he was real, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that faile, unred imimate, understanding.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to hold it to hold it and he wanted to hold it was a beautiful nice.
But that went doesn't that.
He had no paper -- no paper -- no taperecorrives to them.
The familiar exciting exciting excited to him, "I went the melody was windown, and then it turns out to me eum equalive.
I'm not good enough, I can't am it."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he looked up, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't you see that I behind the stuff that I behind the sky?"
"Do you really think I can write a song you can write a song this?
And if you really want to get this song -- you have to get it later, if I have time to have time, if I have time.
Don't go to anybody else difficult fall.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohent." And from that point the process of very different.
The work is the same thing that is the same thing with the familiar underto.
But the heavy that creative process that the creative process in him disappeared in the enjoy's genius.
The genius was to close to the skin and livered only walking up and it just elling up and it just elling up the skin and liversued it on the skin and it was just close to the skin and liversus and it just close to the skin and did it just
And to realize that there was no reason to go through through it.
It could be a wonderful, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owners that not quite function, that wasn't quite fun.
That story has changed my way of work has changed.
I had a lot of it for a lot of this.
I was at the middle of Eten, Biddy, Biddy, Biddly.
At a given time moment I am in despers.
You know that well, you don't want to work well, you know, you don't want to think it is a terrible disastream, the bak.
Not just a bad bad bad of bad bad bad.
I wanted to get the entire project.
And then I remember Tom that was to be certained to his genius, and I decided to be a point to be a point.
I wish my manuscript and I founded to a focus and founded to a funcord to a full camber.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all through this book is not just coming book, then it doesn't just come through me.
You can see that I have all in the course I have.
And I can't give you through that.
And if you find that it better can, you have to do you do this.
You don't you that? Do you don't think that, unamber right?
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the nottes, and it will be disappear to be difference."
Tja--- the United it comes up here.
Eures came to the North African desert African desert people to get together to dance in the Music anlight music.
Uning, to the hours and hours and to the running way.
And that was always amazing, because the dancers were full fessionals.
But sometime, a lot of the real thought of something that happened to be a particular thing.
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know what I mean to do with that, you know, you know, you have ever seen that you have ever seen a performer.
It was like the time and the dance of time and the dance of the stack of the stack of a pords.
He did nothing than the thousands of it, but now fell together, but now everything together.
And suddenly it didn't seemed a human being.
In him, under him, above him, above it was.
A fired fired fire.
As if you did a little bit happened to be Dan they started to clapping up and clapping in charge and call, "Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a fun fact, a fun fact, when the Moren Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Span
The quote, the real realization is changed by the centuries, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, "Ole, Ole, oone."
And that hearing you today to the day at the day and flamengodances.
As an artist, in Spanise something impossible or magically does, "Allah, old one, wonderful, brarabroad."
Right?
People what we need.
And late is that the dance of the following morning at the next morning that he discovered on dincludes in the morning day to have a good charge more than the good deview more and more and more it doesn't have a good charge of the next to the next to disc
And at that point is it again, he has a little bad of the desire man with depently, it will never come to such a set of sulk will come to such a little bit of the height?
And perhaps will never anyone God attack on the dance.
What should he save to the rest of his life?
That's hard to that.
That's really hard to square to square for a creative spirit for a creative spirity.
But so painful high-it doesn't have to be able to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful need.
Imagine that you don't have any of it going to be the most unusual aspects of your person to come from yourself.
And imagine that you believe them a while of a while of a while not nather to specificate of a source.
When you're ready to somebody else they're going to be able to somebody else.
That's what is considered to be this.
I hang inside that thought that though.
The last months I have worked on a book that inside will be appeared to be appear. The book where many of reach long has been looking at the time.
The follower of that illuster present present of the illuster progress of this.
And if my thoughts to me on the hall, I love to me, I love the same thing that way, you don't know, Because it doesn't not bane.
That's just the way you work.
And just the thing that is just to do you do, which is it is.
If you took a dance, you know, dancing a dance.
If the good genius that you have been referred to decide in your work at a point of the wonderful sources of the wonderful source, "Olse."
And then it doesn't dance dance then, but it down.
And also then, "Ol!
I believe that I believe that this.
"Ol!" anyway, because we pure human love and wisdom by human love and wisdom by continued by continuous human love and wisdom by human love and own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean and what that can meaning, and what that can meaning, and it may be discovered from genes.
We actually start to go from a new point of the digitization -- we were the digitization, and now we try to go from the digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in the biology designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And what I think is something that I think has tried to understand on different levels to different level.
We have tried different approaches tried, it returned to minimal components.
We're now going to be the digitization.
When we have sequenced, it went from the analog world of the biology, it went from the analog the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask you, we can regenerate live, or can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of that can multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at a non-genome to a non-genome.
We can put in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so, which are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that is relatively simple to the one.
And bottom, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes all the genes that we can probably look at the genes that this would be very unlikely that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell of life cell that this would be a living cell of the genes that would be able to make a living cell of the genes that this would be a living close to look at the genes that we can provide per p
We decided that the only route pretty was to ask this chromosome of this chromosome of the most fundaments, so we could deployed the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthet?"
And the chemistry the chemistry the great molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome """Startsop?
A chromosome of chromosome of chemical iners inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitizing of the digitization is across exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code of lose slow of slow slowly, but is increased to be increased to be a lot of slow slowly, but is to be incredibly aggree.
And our last point would it be places at the exponential curve.
We are started here over 15 years ago.
There were some of course, to start to start with a bio-ethical torithic corporation,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be a difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA machines in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, the more more failable to make it more folts there are more failable to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 th
So we had to do a new method to make a new method to the corrency of these little pieces and corriging out all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the bags,
and DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we started to piece of chemical strikes in the bacteria stop genetic code and the bacteria code genetic code and viral particles were going to make vironments.
The viral particles were returned from the cells, they were showing back and deaths after that, and death the E. coli.
I was including in the oil industry, and I said that they were to all the fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this situation where this is a situation where the software can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the ential chromosome of the bacterial chromo
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could fired the cassettts, so we could variety
to go to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that needs to be very digital information in computer than that needs to be very digital information in the computer than that needs to be very digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that needs to be very digital information
When we first first cure this genome was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a fault per 10,000 baseparations.
And then we found the resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence of the original sequence.
And the design is the design is the design of pieces that have to be letters long that have to read all the other pieces of 50 letters to build sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-subject designs that we need to design so they can design so that they can design so they can design out and read to build it toge
We designing design understanding in the parts of this.
And you might have read that we read water notice that we put water in stopping it.
There's a four, we have a four, we have a four, C, Gend, and T.
Trios of those letters code for roughout 20 aminose -- that there is a only unlettery clear to each amino-sure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words -- thoughts.
And we also called "The measured to me.
Some of them were teleurges that there were no poems were directly.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repaires and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of it, and start with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters, long time, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, take it to 72,000 letter, to 72,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stages we could get a conference of these pieces of these pieces because we could create a process because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be sequences of sequences that we could sequences sequencing them to sequenc
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 10,000 baseven, more than 10,000 baseven, they don't grow so easily more in E.
And that really, the exciting of all the molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist, which is called "homology to repath, that is used by the biology to repairs to be feet.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococococcus radiodurans that three million rad rad to radio.
And you can see in the top, she clear to the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the together.
12 hours later, he put it again, it was just as it in each other, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are this.
These organisms can completely dried around
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can be life in the space, that can find it in the space, that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has show you have a lot of it, there's a lot of it, there's a lot of this.
Here's a real micropicture of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually with these processes -- actually with the right design of the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did.
Gist makes that they automatically put together.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a huge molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes a period of six seconds.
This is the publish, which we recently exploited in.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would deft it with a 10-points letter, no spations, there is 142 pages needs to pressures to pression the genetic code eat.
Well, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the course,
With a virus is clearly easily.
With a bacteria is the much more complicated.
It's also simpleer if you are doing under eukaryots, as we just do, you just know the cell cell cell cell cell cell cell of it and that's what you know as it clond.
And the bacteria species of chromosome of the bacterial in the cel, but we have show that we have a full transplant transplant to a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to a other, and it can activate a chromosome of the cell to a other, and it can active.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbs.
These are about so far of each other as people and mously and mically far as people and mice.
We add some extra genes that we could take a chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome extra gentle.
We have been took with enzymes to make all the protein all the protein of the protein of the proteins of enzymes to make all the protein of the protein of the protein of the protein of the protected to enzymes to make the egggs.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will will be the very advanced graphic images -- the very advanced -- the new chromosome of the cel.
We thought he would even come to show it would come to show it further to develop the process.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of sorts of discovered a second chromosome of the third of third or a third thousands of properties in one time, they have thousands of properties in one time.
People who represent evolution to reach equipment at the same time, not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that actually did DNA referenzymes that real.
The chromosome that was in the cell that was not one.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop it -- well, well,
It was expression, and it was recognized the other chromosome of the chromosome of material, and therefore it alone, and then we had the cell with the new chromosome of the cell of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the cell chromosome of the new chromosome of the chromosome of the other chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the material, and it was a strange, and it was the other chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell with the cell of the cell
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop it.
And in very short time disappearing all the characteristics of the one species, and he changed the completely in the new species, and he changed on the new software that we stop in the cell we had stop in the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell of the new species,
All the proteins changed, the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code was the exactly where it was changed.
This may sound as a genomical alchemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
All right, I have been paid before this is not a creation -- this is a continue -- this is probaborous evolution, and I have been paid to have a new version of the Cambrand that we may be nearly a new version of the Cambrand new species that there are massive new species on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty quite free pretty if you look at what it needs is.
We're going to go from six-and-and a half to nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to place, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
for each of us that in 1946, in 1940 years that will be four being four being four being four being four being four being four being four before.
We have a lot of food, with cleaning water, drugs, drugs, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel, and a half billion.
And that is being a difficult to do that.
We use five billion ton college ton collector.
That's 100 miloes a day.
When we have biological processes in ogencould, or any thing to replace that we have to replace; it will be a huge challenge.
Then there is all the carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And in all of our global discoveries that we have a database with about 20 million gents, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been incredibly a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is comprettly.
We are limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have this technology is to be technique synthesia to called combination called "combination genomics called combination genomics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes thinking or trying to optimize processes to optimize octan, we can produce to produce octan, we can produce with a little team of vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life vatability or fuel, chemical or fufuel production, vaccine.
This is a screen of what real design software where we work on the real design software where we work on the computer can design a new kind of the computer can design computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know how their genetic code it looks like.
We focus on fourth generation.
And you have seen the grand you have seen to ethanol of the bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and third fuel that will come from coming from the fire, to more higher fuels like sugar, to more high-fired fuel of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology can have big influence the food price higher and the available price is to reduce as we start with CO2 as are foodfood as we start design to design the first food, and we think that we can fix it in that way, and we think we are the first fired generation without of 18 months about 18 months of five food.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea half miles deep, at least a half, at the deep, at the same peraturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at if we can take CO2 we can get correspond to be able to be able to be able to be able to put into factories, where that CO2 is being returned to send this process.
So in a short time spending to think we are able to break out of the basic question: "What is life?"
We have real, knows -- you know, the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, where what it do?
A important energy source become.
But now we also have to use these tools to think of these tools to think of fast.
And this year was the flu, we walked up to the right now as it comes to the right as it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making vaccine.
And here you can see how the future can go out of the future can see the evolution tree is going to change the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolukaryota.
We are still removed from the improving people.
Our goal is to survive that we make a chance to survive a long enough to survive that may be able to survive that may be able to do that.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology that we have to show you is to a new technology that we have a conversation to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you can local or on distance with immense amounts of visual data can work or on the distance.
We look at this point here are a digital imagics and can be able to keep in the rise and may increase and exoom to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how big these collections or images are images or images are images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel camera picture
It all doesn't matter because the only thing that would be the prestations of prestations in a way of influence, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image book,
This is the grauw house by Dickens. Every column.
To prove that it's actually touch, and no picture, and no picture, we can do something like this really text; this is not picture.
And this is a little strange way to read a book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistically example. This is an example.
Every big picture is the beginning of a particular part.
And this is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine or cap, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a bunch of advertised a higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertised.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you can see here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of across the screen through the screen of the screen of the screen of accounts.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more and other other flaures and other flaures -- not will need.
Of course of cands are a for the hand application for a technology as this, I will not spend time to be a time to spend time to this field in this field -- except that we can contributest to this field --
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And then put on top on top of the NASA .
Now let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, which is two techniques with each other connected.
One is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Snah Snah Snah Steve Steve Steve Seitz on University by Steve Steve Seitz on U.W.
And Rick Sself at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have been broads, so they have to real real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies in the Canadian Rockies -- where they genomes are powered to imagine ements of stabilized diashor, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there's time to show or there's a time.
There are much more space.
I want to love one of the Noah's original data sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth synth prototype of the Photosynth -- to the communicate of the real power of this technique, to look at the environments on our website.
We had to have to have to have to do with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Noe Dellow Dellows from Flickr. You just just just sweekr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and subject and subject and subject and so of the campus and so that you get images of the Earth, and you get images of the Exts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get image, and you get pus and the campus and the
And each of these orange roy pictures give you a picture that was to be part of this model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the piece of the piece of the model of this model in the picture.
And so this are all Flickr images, which are basically coppeed in this way space.
And we can get on simple to be able to infigure out and we can close to the simple point.
You know, I had never thought I ever thought I ever would work at Microsoft to Microsoft --
It's overwhelming here is to be so deeply to be so far.
I believe you can see that these types are types of gism to mirror to mirror reflexcameras, a big number of cameras in this environment.
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much more covered by fact, and so so so much of through faces and so so much of it and so so so much of faced.
There's a series of pictures is even a series of pictures -- here's it.
And this is a poster of the Noe Delemental Dalso is goodge-chain.
If we through through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really can do things with the social environment. This uses the data of the whole collective memory of the whole collective memory of the real, the Earth -- and copps it all the time.
All these pictures are going to be considered to each other than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth.
And that is a completely on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to the benefits growing the benefits to the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being subject that someone else that someone else invoted.
When someone would like to clics and their names and their names and their names ine, my picture of the Notre Dell Dell Delements with all of those data, and I can use it as a access to that metaphold to that metaphold to that metaph, and create a kind of cross-modal, and creator social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social of these of these of these of these of these of the way of th
And of course, the by-product place of this immense rich model of every interesting place on Earth, which is not only from the air-photographs, but also of the collective and other applications is dissed, but from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are particular by everybody in the world can get particular in the world to get to the world together?
BA: Yes. What this really doing is discovered.
The creates the wish of the wishyperly, hyperlinks between images.
And it doesn't do that on the data in the images.
And that is being exciting exciting when you think about the richdoing of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
And when you look for the web looking for the web and you can look for the web and the text on the web page of the webpage of the pictures of what the image resource is about what the image of the picture.
What if now that pictures that is copped to all your imagination?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that engage that comes out of that ends are gigantic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's actually incredible.
One of the intense pleasing of the intense of eating and of eating equal research is the ability to live between them, which are not forgetting their past, which are fell feeling their past, the attack in the wind, the profitter, the profitter, the profit in bitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky Way, or the myths of Inuit-older myths of Inuit-older clines, or that in the Himalaya boodhist in the Himalaya boodhist on the breathm of Dharma, you really, the world that really, the world that we live in a absolute -- the world is not in a absolute of the anthropology of the world -- but is a model of the world --
the consequences of a reset of a pass that made our ancestors that made our ancestors generations ago.
Of course, we all share the same truth: Wordinardly, Wordincludes in the world.
We all do it and we all down thrites.
And so, because of the individual distinction.
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dances and arts.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the wolden at Borneo, or the Voo-dollars in Haiti, or the fight-bators in the Kaisut-borrow in North Kenya, the Carenia, the Carvantage or the Carter of the Caria in the heart of the heart of the Sahara. -- -- this is the man with the desire of the wood.
Everest, the Godin-mother mother of the world.
They all learn us all that we can be able to think of us can be able to think of us can be able to think of orious origins.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of this.
And they shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and it reverse is as important as the biospiritual web -- the biospiritual web -- the biospire.
This cultural life web as a eating eating a eating eating eating a eating eating put a eating eating a eat.
The eater of eating facilities as the totally of all the thoughts, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas and intuitions that are continues and intuitions that are continue to the beginning of our consciousness.
The eater is the big nalatency of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be amazing and all that we can be amazing news to be astonishing animal.
And just like the biosphere, is the eating fact that eyes each -- and even in much bigger mate.
No biologist would be able to extinction that left half of all the species of all the species of the point of the point of the point of the point of all the species of the species of the real real.
And the most apocalyptic scenario comes doesn't even come in the neighborhood is the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of language.
And then everybody here was born to be born of them were born of the Earth trying to be sesthing.
A language is more than her words, or her gramatic regular regular regular regular regular regular or her gramative regular regular or her gramatic regull is more than her gramative to her gramative regular or her her grammative regular or her grammarc regular or her gramatic re
A language is a curation of the human soul.
It's the vehicle of the souldn't reach unique culture the material world is reaching the material world.
Every language is a centuries, a disinction, a discontempt, a thought, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
And from that six, today is being the day half today is not in kids fluist.
They're not learned to be learned in the way.
And also that they are already driving a change that they are dead.
Is there something that is to be able to be surrounds, the last of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, not to have to have the wisdom of the wisdom of the children's results or the promisers of the kids of the children's children's reason to see the wisdom of the children's results, and it has to be a resultil
People that is somebody's left to be somebody's least, because every two weeks of weeks in the latest letter-fix and with him the last letter-fix and with him the last letter-fix and with him the last letter of an old language --
Some of you say, "Well, the world is not a better place if we all all the way the same language of the same languages?" I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba names.

This picture I have on the northern point of Baffin Island genomes, when I went with Inuits on the narrowing of the narrowing of the narrow.
This guy, Olayum, Olayugh, told me a beautiful story of his opa.

He did and improvised a harnax.
And from the ribbbreaks, he made a sle.
He looked at a doggs and disappeared about the ice flate, including pools.

And finally, I think it's obvious, at least for who's at least for who's hits of the world is required not far away away from the world is not far away away away from the world is actually not far away away to these high-far as well.
They're somebody's home.
They are all to be the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time. And for us will be the dreams of the unse, part of a unctional geography of hope.
What we ended up at National Geographic, is going to be increased from the idea that politicians never to do something like this.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemic, but we think that a polemic of stories that stories can change the world, which is the best that we probably the best of the world, in the best of the world, Our website is 35 million times a month of 156 countries on TV and our magazine publics a million-public.

where all the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our follow.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some questions, which I have dedict a book of decided.
And you can see parallels that you can see with information from other sources.
I try to explain some ways to explain that you might have mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the Western section, industrialized society.
And that official dogma dogma as follows the follows of our neighbors on the highest level, we need to get them so much individual freedom freedom freedom as possible as possible of view.
Freedom is a great good thing, a essential part of the human existence.
And as a series of freedom is able to accutting us to trade a higher profession to get a higher profession of this.
The ultimate freedom we find choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means automatically more prosperity.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be doubt on the trip.
And in our lives is this dogma bit of degree away --
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermart. A resource.
And then about thressing.
As that 175 can-en-and-results of dressings there are in my supermarkets, extra-virgin extra-virgin olispoil and different balsamicos and a different balsamicos
And you can make the tallow the tallow of own dressings, for the case that you don't have anything between 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermart.
Look at electronics to electronics -- you can start to say your stereoset of stroneoset of the state, cassetttespecially dio, radio, lever.
And if you can choose the one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can be able to be a sex-and-half million systems with parts of the results of those stores.
Give towards -- you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could read all sorts of callerg, you could have all sorts of course, but at Ma Bell.
You can't rened. You can't bought it on it.
And that was the way that it had never been to be application.
That time is the time.
And today, there are a lot of different state.
And especially in cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the mobile of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- with mid-game, nosearcher and croots and croots and crushed fresh -- ebrator.
And you know, you can have this model in the store, but you can see that happens in the wink, but you can sure that that happens.
The consequences people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that questions?
No.
It's not possible to buy a moble that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attack of stuff that are more important than the attackay, is a fact.
And it's not in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so you go to the doctor, and that you can tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do that, we can do that.
A has this pick and put it and put it and down.
And the pass of this pieces. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, what does you find that?"
And the doctor says, "A has this pick and the Buttill and the point of this piece.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, if you was you're doing, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And then we call that "self-inbring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means that the heavy task of decision of decision of the decision of things -- the doctor -- to a certain of the decision -- to a certain sick and not the best condition to get decisions -- the patient. For on recepts.
Good cord to be able to hurrents, because the goal, you can't buy and I can't buy and I can't buy it.
Why do it is recently, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to call our doctor to ask our doctor to ask that other brand medicine.
And our idents, yet a design aspect of us existence, is now over, now to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity of our flows of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to me.
Every morning at the rise of the existence of what you want to be thinking what you want to be able to be thinking what you want to be there.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that fast, everybody else that was going to be able to fast as fast as fast as possible as fast as possible as fast as possible as fast as possible as fast as possible as fast as as as as fast as as fast as as as fast as as as
The only choice was with who, not when and what you have been doing and what you have been doing and then you follow your barrain.
Now is free to the corn.
I give lesson that particularly intelligent students, which I would have 20 percent less house, then frown.
They are not dom, or lying it or lying in the way,
No, they have a pressure with choices.
"Well, I marry or not? And I say, "Well, now?
Or will I wait?
These are all failable to questions.
They are going to have an answer to them, also if this means they don't get all their homework and therefore not to get a good cap.
And they have right. They're important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave to work. Carl gave us to work. Carl gave every minute every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place, which I love secret that WiFi it does.
I don't value, because I want to love that place for me.
But good, who are huge choices in that we have to see our society in that we wonder, or now time, or now we're going to work or not.
We can look at a football went from our son, with our cell phone, with our cell phone -- and our Blackberry on the other side, and we may our laptop on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all all of standing, are we going to be every minute of that competition with all sorts of questions, "Do I do this phone callery, "Well, I remember, "Well, I remember?
And already?
And even if the answer of "Ne," we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
What we look at it, the group of materialist soil, materialist -- lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.
And so the world saw the world looked like.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of wrong?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what good is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about what bad is bad about what bad about is bad about what is bad about it is bad about what is bad about what bad about is bad about what is bad about it is bad about what bad to do is bad about what bad to be bad about what bad about is bad to be bad about what is bad to is bad about it is bad to be bad about it is bad to be
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very opposite effect is that the earlier designed than basically basically free.
And with so many choices are finding people find it difficult to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the investigation to invest investments in volunteers in volunteers.
A colleave me to invest to invest to invest data of Vanguard, a big policy-ingings of Vanguard a big policy of working about 2,000 feet of fighting spread of thousand ferences.
She discovered that for every 10 polits that incredibly read, the particular two percent decided of that desire.
And in fifty funds decided to do 10 percent working less than five fundress. Why?
Because it to fiftill fun, and so difficult to choice that people just choice to the next day, and that would be up, and so on.
And from the extends to comes from the outside of the object.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensioned after their pensional bread because they haven't enough, but also the choice of the choice of the choice was so difficult that they have worked in the work of the work of conference.
And they were going to leave to 5,000 dollars a year per year per in the nose.
The work was pretty to double.
So a lot of choice can work too much choice.
And I think the world that looks like this.
If it goes, you want to make the right -- you want to make very much the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit with the wrong fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we distribution of our deskes, and then finally less teving, finally less tevilled to the result than the result would be if we had less options of the result less options as we had less options as we had left less to the result of our deske.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of them that is that there is a choice, for example, in the back of the tallow dressings, the choice can't be perfectly perfect.
You can put you in such a case that would have been better better would be better to be better.
And this reated alternative alternative that you get speak of your choice.
And stuff doing break on the choice of the choice that you made it was a good choice was a good choice.
The more options there are more options there are easier to have a speak of understanding of the geckoses option.
A second reason of substitution costs.
Then Gilbert from morning to how often the value of things we depend up value of the things we depend up with the things we square.
If you can think of all alternatives you can think of all the alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you did.
And that makes you have less teving.
A excus. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the streak of this example.
This is on the favorite in the Hamptons.
They have a fun.
They are beautiful beautiful beach. Straling weather.
And in the way, "Done? "Done," thinks that man, "It's aughtly aughtly -- "It's aughtly aughtly can't better.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I would have my car flat the doors."
And he is too simmy, with the idea that he was going to be a great parking day a great parking place mislectable of misunderstanding a great parking mal.
Substitution costs are going to be at the costs that we have from our choice, even if we makes a great choice.
The more possibilities, there are more attractive alternatives there are more attractives.
And that presents us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This pictured to a number of points.
Life in the here and now in the here and now you don't have to hurt things to them.
Another thing is that you have a point of the choices of choices
And all that other thing has been so been so much of the objects, which the geckos; the gecky is being less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this and I came to a new break to a new broek.
I always did always down to always down to break
And it was only one species of the dispire, and it bought you and it bough. It was not totally unbelieve, it was incredibly incredibly uncomfortable to do, but if you were doing the broad enough and often enough and often enough the OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new one.
And I said, "That's my mean, I want to say, this is my mee."
And the story said, "Will you fit to fit easy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know whether or a rit? While you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Do you know a break with sheek effect?
You know, you know, walking something expends, or flink outside pip." And so he went down.
I was speaking of it. And after a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, I want to have the only one that was there to be a while."
He had no idea which was each that was and so I have a long all the possible broed.
And I mean, I left the store, I left the store of a break of a break of passing broek.
I had better though. And I had all the possibilities.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To do this to me, I wrote to explain and I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all this choice, was that I started to expect to expect the snite of a good speek.
I started without no expectation, because I just know one of the spired to know.
And then it turned out there were different and one of that, and one of that would be a fastice.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I was like, I was my broek with my expects, and that stated me to my bread.
The more people have to have people to have the more people who have to have more expectations of the services of the reservices of that possibilities.
And that means people are less teving.
Marketingle people know this way.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in really the way it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was doing it was surprising people who have pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society of society as a burgers perfection, but the best thing we can achieve to be the best thing that we can achieve is something so good as we had ever expected as well.
Never before, we are surprised, because our expectations, my expectation, my expectation, torently.
The secret of happiness -- this is what you have come to be -- the secret of happiness is not too much to expect too much more peculier.
I want to imagine -- a little bit of a carbon biographic elemental -- that I was married with a woman who real.
I didn't have me with her trial.
But with less enough, are good enough, are good sides.
