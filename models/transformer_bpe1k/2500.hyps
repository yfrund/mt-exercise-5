In the Gomen of the Groods, and Rominess people not five people don't five people are not fienough people are not fienough the same of the same of the same of the Grood.
And I think that creativitivitivity a good of a reasonly reasononly the place of the place and the place and the place and the fadentor.
The Groom of these call these put this is the ficity of creativitious "The endemoney did "
And in Sock Socates that he had a demight that he had a demiflet she had a decerence.
The Rominedins a kind of ideidea.
And they have a generateous to the creative creative a generation.
And the other thing is that the Romins and a generation and a generation of a basically person a person in a generate.
In their others was a general kind of a magine magine that ever ever every socevery single of the maturature of the aturaturing of the anything of the mits
A means like Dobbbitise.
If the artivironly work the next of the generateassistantist.
And the showing of the work work work work work.
And Broot! That's the possion the first thing I was the first thing about the first thing about the psychological multimical resulty of the results.
And the every wish that is work in work in work in work
The artived in mmight in momency and example to be a lot of cisime.
And if you have a bilically she was not not not all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all the eage.
And If a wist that a shows that a shows you had a show.
Berause you know, the same thing that not only not only not only not only not only not only not only not only not only not only be be be be a year.
And, a wist that a gonly dical dical diced a lot of a gonly diced general dice.
Let's be the Weeever the Westivitivity and creativity.
And then the Renam the Renairish, and all all all all all all the Renened.
There's a very idea very idea very idea very soce: it's the muniverse of the universe of the universe and the universe and the unimay and the universes and the unimay and the universe.
And a shot of mystice of the world, and sources from the world's deal.
And this was in the rational mital human.
And the every folities that creativitivitivity,
And for the first thing in the society is that work about a geneeey that we don't have a generation and they were not a genereeeds.
I have to say that I think that a big g homed.
Om one person a sonly one of a sindivives that he he he he he he he he he was the same ame of the browish of the source, the anything that the every same of the every very shows of the same thing that is a lot of the society of the poinsionly a poinsione.
As you mybe fious in the same mouttts.
Egood to be increate and productions and productions and productions and every exput to be a lot of poptions of poptions of piculated.
And I think this drun this dric years ago, a lot of a lot of the last years.
And if if if think that is the questive, "What do do do do do do that?"
Cunce?
And we are show we understand on a one of the relationseen the relationsociet?
Maybe not not not not not not not not not not not not not a sess;
And we can do 500 years we've been a year, not a mirirdn't be in a 100 minut-minuds.
And the shape of the audiences that people who are people who have the scientifive the idea that have have the idea of the idea of the ideagain, and the face of the fact, and the pircle of the instirgs and the before of the eastence.
And it is not to be a little bit in the done in the mean,
And I mean, I mean, I me.
Why do any?
Why we don't have to be a day to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be a fold to do why
And the showing of the entions as a lot of the entions of the magintal maginsimits that are increating in the creative in the creative in the creative in the creative in the creative in the creative in the creative the creative that the creative the clocal communitive that all the encedits that the slocal five the encors
And then a set of a little bit has a product of create and so so so so so so so that is not here and so that are not always not always not always not always not always are not always be.
And the sonly banany of the any of course.
And I have the long gglong American American Stters Stunched.
And we have a dick in the next of the next of the next of the next of the next of them.
They have the store about her on the plators of the platory of the Unitia.
And when they were on the five the world, the world, the world, the world, the girds.
It was so said, a big g or a big g glast a big g cloulds.
And the same thing about the land the land the land the land her than the her than the her than the land the land the land the land the land the land the land the land the land the land the land country.

They go to the home hight, by the next of the moved and they moved and the possible and the pasick and the pasick and being and being and the pasicture.
And when it was a her her her her her her was a her her her her her to be the skids to be faill
Some it was not not not the next of it.
And then then then then then then it is not the human man is not the human is not the human is not the human homen
And so the sonomy society by the dices by a shows of the same time, and a showing -- a distanother did --
And so I was a show -- this is a showed -- this is the mirst of the story of the story that they were busine.
And then they came in home and papappapappapapapher and the dice.
Jugs on that had a posed than a posed to a posed to be a posed to be a posed than a potts.
And with her her to the let me me me me me the again, the again,
They have the diction of the distant, and the week in her in her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her and it it it before and it in the representttty in the her her in the slow.
And in all all the next of the diction in where the next of papapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapher than the next of the fold.
And I was a hor, what I thought -- I think that I though, my fair, my faird my faird my foom --
And so my work to be a creative a medium! I don't medium!
And I think a music, who day, which is a thought of the same thought of the same this, and each and trany and a lot of a lot of hor.
But then I think that day in the same thing I have a shows so so so so a around areage.
And you can be be a bigh of that that eash that creative that creative that creative in your borors a brarains that you can think a brarains of ficidentificicive you can think that you can think that you can think of a borimay of ed.
What is that for busin?
How can we can think it that we do that we think that think that we think think that think that that that we think think that that do do it it this,
On a way to do us to do us us for us for us to us us to us us us us to do us a way of us
The gst contemporty that I think that I think that I think is that I think is the Ways.
And a years ago, I wright now I was a came of a came of a cor.

And so he thought he in Lots Anglish Angglish the cor, and the circ.
And then he was so her a fral hold he was a fraghtine.
And the she came inspiration, as that is that faker fious of the five fious of the ence.
It was a mome of the fasue and he wanted wanted to fase the fasuts.

He of the every much in pan, but he dimental came that that the came thing thing that the deed.
And he said to the last hight, "Sor, Sord: "Sor, you can't see that I don't see that I don't see that I don't see that I don't do it is not the last hor,

It was work is a society with the same thing the came time,
But the same thing that are creative the creative in the creative in a crically and he was a penery of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation.
It general sham on the human and the human and the learning and the cop.
And then to be the realized that was no realthy to be by the real.
The kill is a society society is a kind of conversical conversictil Takids and the Task of Task Tak Tath,
And that's my hities of my work on the work of change.
I have a profive of of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the profive a profive a lot of a five a profive a profive of a profive a profive of it.
And I came in the smmiddle of Ets, Baaaairds,

I wanted to be the project of the project of the whole
And then I memmight to To me me me me me me to be a posed and I was a posed to a posed to be a posed to be a posed to be a posed to be a point of the sically a posed to be a possist,
I went of my home of my manmany and a hights and a high-leave a hights.
And I said, "Lup, we don't know that all all all this is not all this is not a booook, it's not only not not not not all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all of the mout.
You can see that I think that I have a stice I have a little bit in what I have to be in what I have to be in what I have in the stany in what I have a little bit in what I have a little bit in what I have to be in what I have a stick in the stic.
And I don't don't have to be to do it.
And if you have to do it it it it than you're going to do you this.
Sep you that you? Do's nothing that you're nothing that you're nothing you that you're nothing you that you?
I have a smuse, because that's that's going to work my work my work on my work
O, and in the came and the tull and that easy that is a fice that easy difference of differencould."
Ta--- U.SSSStunity on the next of this is a lot of the next of the next of the next of the next of the neeration.

And the ry and and and and and the own and the own and the officullors.
And the always was a lot of the professed and the professionals.
But we are very happened the every searing something something something something something that happening
A dance of those of the world's work than the trance.
And you know what I know what I know what I have a little bit is also so so so so so so a feel of a perfore of a perfore of a perfore of a perfore of a perfore of a little bit of a perfore of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a feel of a feelelel
It was always in the still and the ansanswer by a per of a stance.
He is not changes than the dustry of the energin, but now now five now fious now thousands of the samounts of camounds.
Plotal learning not long long long a mental less of long le.
In fact, there's a body body body cool.
And a good fious do do do this.
And if if if if if people happened in the people was what it was the Dan Ah, and the Dan eah, "All All All All All All Got, Ah, God, God, God."
Because it was the hight.
And then a less leage of the Moris: Too-and the Moran-and the Moran-Sancalled these Morances with these Morany and they are all these Morany and the Morany and the Mor.
The space is the echill by the euph, "All All All All All All All All in Oh, Oh, one in one in one in one of the euhol."
And that's a fious of the day of the still and fairs and faill and pansically and pansically pansice.
If you take a Sanimpossible or something or or or or or or or the eashollar: "All All All All All l All l l l l l she distance,

Peope we have to have a ceas.
Lastig is that the dansansansansings the next that he was a day that he was a day to 11 11 of the sincluen't be a chill of the since.
And so that he was a little bit is a whole of the one is not a lot of the entiful that are more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than anything to be more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more

What he have to be the rest of his life of his life
That's a move to be it.
That's a devely to be a creative and a creative to a creative picture.
But so the put of the ft of the red.
And then you don't know that is not going to be the most of the most of the most of the most personly person of your person yourself of yourself of your body is not the most one.
And you have a good that they have a good of a girl, you have a nam of a nam specifice specifice
And when you can be a little bit of the most of theory, they are being anything to be anything of the one of anything of the one of the one of the body

I was a day that are day that thought of it.
And the last ast one of a book, I have a book, that is going to be be a lot of the long remember, where many to the long a lot of course.

June Cohen: Ol!
And you know, I have the only ly ly one of this projects, it was a project of these projects, and the human and the engince, and the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new before
We starts of the biology of a punogy and we have the biology of the biology and now we are now try to be a new new new new new fask in the fology of the biology of the big systs and the fastick of the fish of the flone.
So we always proproteced to full the great fairc.
"What is something something something something that I think that I think a lot of a lot of a lot of a differences on the different of different different different difference.
We have different to be a different of the terter, the terms to be compuuual minminuts.
We are now 20 years ago.
And we have the world, we have the world, have the world, was the world, the world, the world, was the world, the world, the world, to the world,
Now we can do to be a new new new reasons, or or or or or new or new new new new new new new new new new new new new create it?
This is the came of a morganish Mycoplasma myics of the incum with a kind of the general kind of a kind of a kind of figure that a kind of figors in a didiculoriany in a sulorganian.
And we have a proteced to be a small or or a small increate ince.
We can be in the orth of the orth of the early of the 500 of the 500 or so that are all of the orious that are coulds.
But if we look at the means of the means that are relation, which is relation,
And the anything this is a five of five five fly.
But if we can look at the only genes that we can be per that we can be a single of the sonly be a cope that would be a cope of the leave a cope of the leave of the leave being of the cope of the leave before that we can be a cope of the cope that we can be a cope and then we can be a lot of the fave that we've got
We means that the only thing that the only thing to be a cools to this is the company syness syncissue that we are so so so so that the componly componly the componly that the company of the funderstice of the funday of the funderstill funderstill that that that is a day to be a day of the company to be a local flo
And so we started started frawing a chross of the same chross a chros?"
And the chemice of this is the envircular and we have to be be be be be eas?
End, if we can do a chchill momother?
A choically is a tricically a sourcy society material materi.
And then our point of the learning of the leave the leave expentions on expentions of the pentivice.
And the same thing to be the geneased to be the general longglong country is but it's onomic ever each the general re.
And our last the sunt of the moment place on a place on a expentive.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There's a big of anything for a bio-showing in a bio-shotal pical experiments.
But it it is the synnnning of DNA difficult.
There are sands in the world that are in the world that are world that are flet 30 percent to 30 percent and so the work and so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than 30 perience.
So so we move a new medid for the making for these small these these small these corder the crigors of all of all the corors of all of cors.
And this was our first first first first first first information of the generation of the generation of the generation of the 19.
That's a small of through that bacterians of thing.
We have swer the same time, and the flast cors corors
And and they had a DNAAAl of culed of the leave leaters.
The spans are start of the terms and we start of the terterms in the terimagining in the bacterimagins and the bacterimaginside and the terms and the terms and the terious and the back of the terimaginside of the bacterimagical real and the bacterimagins and the terimagins and the ters and the ters
The fird cells are cells and slocal cells out from the cells and they cells and they cell.
And I was in longglong-industry and I said that they said that they said that they moved to be a decape.
They are more than more than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than
And why we think that this situation is in the ssoftware in a sourcy in a biological system.
But we wanted to do a lot of a big g g g g a lot of a great.
We wanted to be a lot bacterimachill mother.
That's more than 50,000 letters in the endindids.
And then we closed to slots in casses in the casses of the cirusts, we are faircts, we are fairctone-faircts.
And to get to be what the done of the world's work of a less of a five the coundy.
The working is a cruce, and if you start of information in the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer information information information information information information information information in the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the
And we have the first thing for this is the first thing in 1995 percent in 195 percision one of a society 190,000 per 190,000 per of per and per per per 199999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999995 5 5 m
And then we have a five society 30 five the enginction of the endenty didn't have the enough it was not being in the enough it was not being in the world of the source.
And so the design of the working is the working of the work that are country that are country that are all all all all all all the enters of the tters of the tters that we have to be the increate that we have to be working that we have to work and so that we can work and so to work and so that we can be work and so to be a lot of the work and that we have to be working to be a lot of the design of
We working this is increating increating in.
And I have a shows that we have a water of water in the water popopeners.
And I think we have a vivior, we have a vide, A: A, A, A, A, A, A, CA,
And then of the leave that o's done of the trun and 20 percent -- a trun of a true of every sonly increating in a true of inustan.
So we can be the geneal social swrite to be a fious day.
And, we can do do a music.
Some were no last ast that the contold that that didn't ince.
We have this this, we can be so that we can be be be eeymyymmying.
There's the resmmbers that they have a lot of every very sother.
And we started to be show the way to start of the way to be increate that are five that are sountry of the long and then you have a long and then then then slows of 200, and shows of 20,000 than 2000000000,
In fact, we know that are a foceee-flows of these things that we are so so so so so so so we want to be a circle of create that we want to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be a lot of you can see that we want to be a flot of a lot of the soceeeecum
We try to try of the environomic inction of the entimitions.
So this is a basically a basical.
And we have a big of the big and more than 10,000 -- 1000,000 than 100,000 baagain.
And the posside of the moders of the momodernits of the molecular cular biology.
And why we do to be the other means of the other means of the other mean.
We have a means that that he was a homination, which is increations that is before that is used by the biology to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be a so-re.
Here's a example.
There's a ganism m me me me increate inedanodiod's dure that dances that million dance.
And this is in the body in the body is a showing posside the possible of every source.
And 12 2 2 percent to the later of the every very precty came precty as the first thing thing thing thing thing of the first thing thing thing
There are are organized this is these are these mout.
This is increate of learms can be increated to be increated the eorganized this.
They can be a facum facum facum facum facum facum facum facum
I know that there are very sonly in the least that less the most impost, that is a feel of the most of the environly be a billion dreason ds.
NASSSSSSSSASSeight here is a lot of here.
And there's a single of the mole, of the mole, we have the molel that we have these cessing that these cessingle of the cessingle of the course, but we have the working of the world,
Gist for theory that they are between they are foots.
This is no econen-microscoppicropicropicroscoppicroscophicroscope.
It's a microscuups that we can see that we can be a microscope of the microscope cup.
These are a picture, and a periose of the office of the concept of the source.
This is the audiencountry country.
This is more than 50,000 letters in the endindice.
It's the grouldly molecule, by a societs, with a curure cture.
And the moleculed than 300 million ds.
And if we have a 10--10-10-10-leave a 11111111111111111111111111111111111112 2 again.
And how we starts to be a chromos? How do we do it in the pos?
And I think it's a vious the onal maginside may may
And I was a lot of a lot of increating a lot of increat.
It's also the same thing if you get a sourcy areimagin, if you look at the came celely and the came time, and a other other other other other other other other other other other other other incept of you can do do do it is a sourcy and you know,
And they are the bacternics is the momoveststically instically incceary country that we have a long increate that we can see a transpace of a sources of a sountry of a sourcountry and a country and a country of the posside of the point of a lot of the posside of the posed poinsive to be a lo
We have a chrosing possim of a microbicropicrobicrobicrobicrobicrobicrop.
And these are so much of elececonly as people and people and people and people and people and people and people and people and people and people and people and people and thousands.
We foods what we have a came that we have a cross that this is so so so so econg econe.
We have the posed to be the same of all all all the enty course,
And it was flational increational and we can see the copy and you can be the copy and you know, the circle of the came thing -- and be be be be be be be be be be be --
We thought that he would be be a same to be a show we try to be what it is what it was a single of the same thing to be a single of the sone.
This is a sentivice of mean.
We discovered to be a sourts that have a second a sourcy or a source, or a source, they have a day, they have a day in the enentivire of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the sources

We going to go to be a billion the re-year---year--year-year---year---year--year--year--years.
And in my context in my place in 1999. I was 199.
There are now people on this planed's --
And for our own that our less the 199999999960 years ago.
We have to be food, with the same of the same of water, water, the or the or or for the or or for the seastan-or for the billion drease,
And that's the postion to do that for the next of the next to do it.
We use use of billion dollars more than 30 million dollars than 30 milarologic.
That's 100 million dits day.
And when we have a biological came in cources in the circcleart that is also that is also that is a day to be a day that that is a day.
And there's course, which is courlice of the stany of the or the motty of the posside of the tate.
And our others our world's work we have a now of the work with a billion 20 million the company that I would be work as I would be work for the componey for the compones for the company for the company for the company for the company
The ectrononics are industric have a different componly componey and every sindustry the diversity is the way of the way of the ents.
We are example, we have a biological reality and our reality.
We have nothing to be ank the same ame celect synthesesesessed to be increations the combininess of the combininess of the combininess of the combininess
We have now the mother, we have a big billion a million done of a million droper day to be a million the point of a millike.
If you think of 20 million dology or the endents of the product of the circise of the soctants, or socts, or producing in a new produced in a new producing in the ince, we can see in the society of the sircular than the built of the fill of 20 year, or 20 years of the society of 20 million the entivirls in the biology of the enery of the cirlast 20 millic years aircor.
And it's only only standing the ectivill ective.
We can be increating for fect of courcy or picull or productivice, so productivice, so so so so so so so so so so so productivice so fectivicicical fectivicical fectivicical fectivical fectivits in fectivical increating fect of ination,
This is a single of what we can be work in the work where we can work where we think that work to work that the world, and so that the computer of the computer of the computer work of the computer work of the computer of the computer of the computer of the worlds.
We don't know how how how how it will be be to see how it from how it will be be the way to see how it will be how it will be how it will be how it will be how it
We know how the preces how their geneation of the enengine.
We have our ents on our next our generation to be the generation of our generation
One you have a sountry to be a shows a shows experiment.
We have the second and the generation that are instanding and that are instead of the enor, and if if if are more more or more or more or or or or or increate or increate or or or or or inty of increating of the society of the society of the society of the enertastandandands of the energy of the societs.
But the only way that we think that think that biology big four foot that have the foot of the foots of the may and the engy and the enceass and the engincreate and the OK, and and the ences and we are showing and the first thing that we have been work and the first thing that we have been work and the first thing that we think that we think that we think that are four enerenerere's the first four our oically reason the first four office that we have to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be
And the ong and CO2 is one one -- but -- but -- but the world's working the world's designers we have the world,
This is a organized that we have to be in 19999.

So in a kort of corder that we think that we think that we think in the basically in the basical fireason "What is what what what what what is say?"
We have a work -- -- you know the same of the counds of the place and the place of the place of the place of the came time.
If you don't know this is not not do do what it is not not not not not what it is what it is not not not not do it
A important goom is a bron brow before
But we also so so using the work of these work and and and and and and each inction of the work accins of these work
This was the group, we always and it it it it before and it it is the envaccinessing in the since.
And I think that changes of increate informs and increate inction of inction
And here you see how the way to do how that the evolution of the evolution, it's going to be be be be the evolution synghtterns and syners and synamica, and evolution and eia,
We are still of the story of the stories of the came of the smight of the story.
And so the does is a shows that we have a shows to be a long g ever be a long of the light of you can do ank you.
And what I think if I want to be a technology of a is funday new new new technology we have a technology of Mross that we have a technology of Micross a year, this year.
And it's a feel of your or you can be in or or or or or or or or or or or foom in the world,
We can see here here here here is a girls and can be here and and and hereagain, and here's the increating and the pointting and the world and the work and the world and our owent to our office and the working to our other.
And it doesn't doesn't many much how much how how these things that these things these corganized to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be information of the certaininformation of cepepts.

It's also a flexiximay architecture.
This is a lot of a lot of example, a giron-means a mean.
This is a lot of Dically is a is Every much.
And so it is not work and it work and it is not not not not to do this this, and something that we can see this is not really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really

We have also have a lot of this is the came of the Guaran.
We have a lot of information of information -- a lot of a lot of a norder than a noral extrtrancation -- we have a nornor.
If you want to be the mother, of these things you can see the same thing you see it it it this.
Or or other modits or or or or unifications.
And this ideas we can really really really really really the corth of the came percent of the sciences of the science.
We hope that this popop-pence more and more and other other other society -- not more -- not more more more more -- not not more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more --
And of course, for a technology for a socligenty for a technology of a technology of a technology of the thing that I think that we don't know that we don't have a technology of the five that we can be a lot of the pence.
These are all in the U.SSS.

So that's so so the body of my markids of my marking.
And then you look at every soceach soceakes you can see the same astance of courself, and cepts, ceptor, ceptor, cess, and cessed circelectance,
And we are conevery sinctrick you're going to be a since.
You can see the same million dits systems systems systems and stem, and the ince.
And the eevery much -- you have a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very much --
Weeeone example --
And I was a long g long long ong ong ong fairong fradistany frag, but a BBBBBBBBBBBor.
You can be the stelely the stelect of the other.
And the decent that the decided that the stanother thing that the stop.
That is always the expic.
And then there are very much a lot of different different different different different different different different different different different different ce.

The folg: people to the wink and this is the winstead these question.
And you know how you know how you know how the answer of the answer fail?
No.
It's not a movirling a mobits not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not low much a lobal and not a lobal mobity.
And in the leave of the less that are are love than the leave than the skay of the sully, this explosice of a lot of a sourcy of a sourcy of pects of pects of the society of the eage.
And the Units -- it's going to do -- it's going to do it is not more more more than you don't go to do that you that you that are to do what you that you what you do do do do you do do do do do do do you do do do do do do do do do do do do you do to do to do do do do you that you that you do do do do do do do it to do it to do
Now, you look at the down back and say, "Well, we can do do or or or or or or or or do do it.
And this is a glot of the aagame.
And this is a good and you want to do you do do do you do do you do do do you do do you do do do you do do do do you do do do you do do you do do you do you do do do you do do do you do do you do do do do you do do do do do you want to do do do you do do

Why do do they can't be be be be be be to be they?
And so we think that that we think that we think the next of our moral enough to be the next that the other thing that is the enence.
And so they think of us a soceage, a pasick of our pasically being us now the enough this is a dise, like this is a is a of these dia societs.

And that's the first fect of the second that we know that we've got the fect of us that we have the pasup, and the same time, and the resecontrol intless the resulty of the resull of the sult of the sourcy and we were before of the first time.
There's means and reason for for for for a lot of ferenere.
And a done of the same thing that a chill example of the resame back to the put back that they could be be be be not the fect of the fect of the fect of the fect of the fect of the fect of the fect of the fect of the fectous of the fect of the fect of the fect of the chectors

How more mother, are more more more than any to be more more than anything that ever before
And that are presentty us as our substitustitustostics.
And a example.
This means you can see a socean each a tunits picture.
Let's be in the things and now you don't have to be things that you don't have to be things to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be

And then the calory of the calation.
I was a new shistory to my new high--showing a new new new new a new new new new eagain.
I always always always always realways
And the eger was one of one of the kind of course, and who are the anything that magine the possible of the possible of the communically between the broross the bross the country and the same thing of the course, and the OK.
Now, I wink to the wink for a new new new new new a show.
I said, "Dag, I want to a space my space, this is my took my t."

And he had no idea that was a came that I have a long country a long country to passion the passiong passiong passiong passion the country.
And I think is a still light of the next of the course, with a still brain.
I had the thing that day. Thank that are fly, I think the mother.
But I didn't know it it it it it doesn't not the time.
What is a basice of the myself of a boog, I have a book, I have a book.
And the reason I don't know that I didn't have a smits that I was that I was more more of the same thing that I was a good of the name thing of the naircleader.
I start of the only thing because I was because I was one one of one one one of one of one of a kind of ede.
And then then then then there are different of the endone of fect of fect of fect of fect of fect of fect of fect
What I don't know it was not not not not not a good perfect.
And so I did my brow my bross with my book, and that the each and the easy.
And we have more movities people have more more more more more more more more more more distical deces about the enengin.
And that means people are five people freason the results, even if the good reassions.
