And I show you two sliet these two slight to show that the policy that the policy that the last three million years of about the size of the U.S. States, with 40 percent four percent croms.
But this is the reason of this specific problem because it doesn't the disect the diseam of the ice late of the ice late of the ice.
The ice cape on the North Pole is in a certain sense, the climate heart of our global system.
It was in the winter and crinter and crines in the summer.
The next slide I show you is a speeded version of what happens is happened in 25 years of what happened is the last 25 years of what happened to the next slide.
The permanen-found in rood.
As you see it from the dark blued.
That's the years, the years, in the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
It called permanens or five years or older or older, is almost like blood, that from the body, like blood, that from the body's five years.
In 25 years of this is going to be in 25 years of this is going to be in the way to this before.
And that's a problem because the wire Icelebrate around the Northern IJse warming around the North Icigures that free in front of fairly frequence, when it designed in methan, when it is deed, the microbes in methan.
And the total high-fields to the total response in the atmosphere, that could double the amount of if we can double the clows of the course of the cloads of writing point to the corporate point to the atmosphere.
In some understand in the deep of the water.

Whoo! She's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge warmbwarms Groenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver of this.
The water volume is the water than ever ever before.
This is the Kanger-suaway in South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal because it comes because it comes because it country because it comes the place where it comes into the sea.
These stromations are flights.
And the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the south mass the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the months scientists scientists that all the continents now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the West of the South Pole very quickly fast, with nice substance.
The whole continent is further to six meters are coming aespipication, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice massa, there are new now new now, there are new now, who were going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water from that melges of that smelt at the time.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it says the drinking water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reading the predictions are nstigatements of it.
This global dreamed to a dramatical dramatic stycumatic burns.
And the number of natures all around the world is suburning with an incredible and never seen speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of years.
This pattern is completely intential to the pattern is completely intential to the pattern is completely intential to the pattern is completely intential.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 24 hours of CO2 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Look at the eastic area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, west and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drags there's a dragical during in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, naves of the Earth, which is designed for 20 percent money, is the burning fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel warming fossil fuel warming of the Earth, is the burning designs of the Earth, is the burnssil fuel warming fossil fuel warming front fuel warming fossil fuel warming fuel war
Oil is a problem and buried is the all greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest extension of the two largest stoters, with China.
And there was a lot of more urban incredible centers to build a lot of more urban centrals.
But we see a course.
These are the voice carbon the building was the building was annulearned in the last years, where green alternatives were presented in the years.
There's a political state-bat-bat-bat-bat-critical in our country.
The voice carbon and oil industire gave industire 250 million dollars to promot a single cleaning a gensticular gensticular is.
And that picture to me.
The really, the current was in Tennessee, about four billion liters in Tennessee, about four billion liters of money
You probably have seen the news face.
This is the greatest of the greatest did in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

We find that it is -- and the smooth -- and the room is a bit of clean.
So, you don't make care about climate change.
Let me go to the go.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern schone clean hypermodern cities.
Fantastic! The machines make a little law.
But that's the sound of sune clean technology.
And despite the fact that burning burning burning the biggest causes of the Earth, change the remarkable of the earth is, the remarkable probably determine you see all the time.
Look at round, this is the clean technology of the cool technology of today.

And the real America 100 percent schone electricity, bines in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America work, a plan that safer makes us down the security of the Earth generating the Earth.
Eventually a solution that enough to solve our problems to solve our problems.

Al Gore: There is an old Africans speaking that says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go far far far away to go to together."
We have to go far far and fast.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an hold the hopdate about how that works.
So here's me. For those who were not going to be the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever summed experiment ever summed in the miles of the miles in the miles in the size of the scientific experiment in the miles of the genes of the scientific experiment in the largest scientific experiment
It needs to have the circumstances that were less than a billion second naved after the universe to 600 million to 600 million a second of second.
Enorm ambition, this!
This is the machine under Gengine.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is what I work. It's the one I work. It's called the ATLASS. It is called the ATLASS.
Spectacular picture of ATLASS.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that care to a party for a party in the controllect room.
It's a picture of the first particle particle that was all around the LHC and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which particles in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we did that picture picture on 10 September knew that the machine worked on the machine worked on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest or this, if somebody went to Google and saw the Internet page, and the Internet page.
And that means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what was to do with these golden week.
Those were the machine 13 thousand amples when the machine on full powers when the power full power on ful.
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's totally true. It's totally small this."
They can do that because they can do superfect on all the temperaturs.
So on myself a degree of space between the space between the stars, who can take the strands that strands that strands that streads that strands can be drags that streads that strands are basically colder the slide.
In one of the constructions between the nets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wire was something that was happened and it was incredibly electric weather thousand amples that 13 thousand ampone-thousand ampone-thousand ample of ampone-thousand against of the dressed in 13 thousand against electric wearly thousand ample of ample that was there was a thousand against that was a thousand that was thousand thousand thousand ample of thousand thousand amp.
This was the result.
This is another inpression if you realizes you realize that magnets more than 20 tons and we'd be about 30 centimeters they were place.
We are about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have them tools when we are all repair.
Now they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather.
We will remember and we expect it and expect in Junior right to the right or the right now that we can go to the build the building.
Now, of course, have that unhappens that unhappens to the value of scientific research. It's easily research.
I think it's so hard to be so difficult to be hard to go beyond beyond things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did Davy, during the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was so dangerous experiments of the human beings than any of the human beings than any of the human mind than the science of science in natural that are not in nature, and then they are not in natural in nature, and we are completely definite that we definite that we definite that they definite in natures of the work in nature, and that we definite definite definite definite ded out of the work in the work of ite definite definite definite definite of the scientorigure is that we are not have no scrivice out
Thank you!
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your childhood time, when you play with block towards you play with block to your childhood
When you discovered to understand how to take it to figure out and conscious problems with learn through the dehanters by the country with the dehanters of space relationships.
Ruimtell you is a strong because the understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand us.
If an information that inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advisore Pattion and my fashion the nails -- what if we would use a computer Jeee to ask -- what if we would use a computer music, in place of that entire musical fingerence as a kind of digital fingerenergical fingerences that information in the population that information is going to information fectively information that we can information that information that information of information of information that information that information that information of information that information fecspital fectivital fectivital fections of information of information is usside of information of information of information that
and can we want to leave orders and like we can leave orders and like we can leave orders and can we want to leave orders and make orders and make orders and then then
This question is so we decided that we decided to look for an answer, by building the Siftables.
Cort together is a Sift a interactive computer in the size of a cookies.
They can be able to show up with the hand they can be able to show them each other, and they can detect a screen and wire a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands of blocks they can be able to be able to understand the core of understand
Bovenudis are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And before these tools have a more physical difference of their movement and even conscious of their movement and even the way we move them movement, and even more movement, there are different new and nice interactions are going to discover and figure out of their movement.
I'll start with a few simple examples.
This Sift is institured to show a video that played to play and othersice plays, and other sky and othersice plays.
These interactive portraits are conscious consciouss.
Indians next to each other, they will interesting.
If they get up, they can realso do this and can be able to be able to be a little nervous to be able to be able to take this and then what they can be realso fring this and what they can be realso figure out this and then they can get a little nervous up.
And they feel to feel and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequence of this interaction, the using of the interesting of a color as it was a liquid as it was a liquid as it was a liquid as it was a liquid of the color was a liquid of the interesting realizing that one of the interaction, the usbars of the interesting realizes of the interesting re
In this example of three Siftables of the corns and I can use them to make them color in a leg, where they have humans in a leg, where they get mixed in a leging.
If we have reason, we are going to go back to what back.
There are some clear cumble to education, pretty plays, mathematics with language, mathematics that we want to give people the model, and the result of the possible of things like to give things things fast.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci series of a Fibonacci resulty programmatimate.
Here we show you a game that a cross-crabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have to get in every single letter to get around any Siftable, and feel cased words are controlled in a words,
After about 30 seconds is the rescued is the rescued and different, and different, and different, a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in it to try it to try to make it try to make a video of the video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly nearly need to instructions that people need to have instructions
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people on the test.
That's our young business amazing the right, right?
And it seems that he just the Siftables to step the Siftable.
For him were just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for learn language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sift with the Sift with that character of the table.
Here he let me come the sun coming up the Sun here.
Video: The Sun.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brown.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done done an! Yeah!
And then the shake of Siftables and the names of the shape can put the characters with each other, and the carry -- Video: Walabor!
DM: and so his own story tell.
Video: Hall!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it walks down.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: the last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recently developed that we have recentables a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
Eenious variations, where you can choose what you can choose what you can choose what you want to use to use it.
These happened in Siftables can be injected injected in Siftables so you can depick itself to pattern itself in Siftables to be injects.
You put a sound in the pattern through the pattern by the attimes, there are live controlled live controlled like reverble efindible of like reverb, and filter.
They're going to advantage and advantaged and shaped by cance.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are patterns that are pattern on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a extra lead.
Now I place the basline to the basline to the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feed a little bit of slaghtwork.
Video: And now I buy the filter on the drums, so I can infect the effect live to influence live influence.
Video: DM: I can set it through the cancertain through the cano block of the tempo block.
Video: DM: Now I have the filter on the base for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repay rearm pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to preave anything to plann, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter like I want.
And then finally the dims of the entire deming Sift to the left Sift to solid Sift to the left Sift to the left Sift to the dims of the entire demand in the entire of the entire dims of the end.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion from the new human-computer interfaces that are interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brains and lichams.
And today, I had the time to show you a new element in this designs with you together with some possibilities that we are in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the corporation is to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world to our world to our world as we want.
Thank you from heart.
I look at it to you all around with you all and talk to you all it.
I'm writing write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long for a long and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there is a long thing in my life and careers in my life, and career, which I had to reinfluence my relationship.
It started with a book that I did under a book that I did a memoire, "Eten, Bi, Bible that I was very destinctions to my horse the world and an international standard the world and an international standard the world and an international stated.
The consequence, people are all over the time, and always to be dam.
We're doing -- doing -- doing -- down to the go!
People come to me and ask to me and ask care you and asking it ups to me, "Don't you evenar?
Don't you know, you keep your entire life is going to be write but never left publishing to the people are going to be publis?
If you don't have a bang before?"
Erg reason, you know it.
Of course, that would be a very nature I remember 20 years ago, when I was telling that I wanted to be a teenage -- if I told that I wanted to be a teent.
People said, "Don't you get never succcess?
Don't you afraise, you know, you will go through to subject to go through through this?
Don't you afraised your life to this work without that there is something from being comes out that there's ever drown and you will be able to the puin your broken with your broken with your broken bitter?"
Something in that strets.
In the short comes to my answer questions to this questions on this questions on this questions to the questions of this questions are going to ask my answer questions is coming the shorts.
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are worse.
And all the time.
But I'm also much other things that you don't know what you want to do, you don't know that all of things that are all me.
For seeds, and other one-things, and other one-things.
But what is describe to myself the last time that the last time that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is the logical that somebody is to be bang for the work that they work to their human beings on Earth are made on Earth are made in the work of the work of the work of the work that she is going to be able to work to the work of the work that she is going to be able to the opportunity to the human-depends on
What is so basically increative processes that we make us to make the effects of it on the effects of the mind of the minds, something like different work all the work is not happened to the effect all the work of the work of the work of the effects of the effects that we make us to make the effects of creative proc
And then you take my father. He was shiftly, and I can't remember that there was a little bit of 40 years that he was asked to be able to be able to be able to be a bang for a way.
And so from "John, how is it to your chemistrie?"
No, so was not about it was about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been through the centuries, they didn't have the reputation depressive alcoholists.
Scheters writers, that have about a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people turned the reputation human beings are instabous instabout.
Look at the grimy doing the most magnificant creative minive mind the most magnifical creative minute.
Many died young, often by own own own own does.
And even those of the ones that no suicide of suicide under their gave to be concerned to be concerned to be considered to be concernored to be suicide of suicide that don't have a suicide of suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of myself is a piece of myself in the last interview of myself a piece of myself is a piece of myself is a piece of myself is a piece of mysel
That's a lot of what to say about your life work.
But from this kind of except we don't look at the same time.
We all heard it before and have heard and it was all about it all before.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity to connect to be connected to artist, and that a artist, and that a artist.
And so I want to ask everybody today, you know, that idea can you with that idea can you with that idea of liv?
Do you have that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think about the entire not think, I don't think about the prettic thought.
I think of refright.
And even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century to be so going.
We can creative spirit to creative spors to live sports.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be dangerous to be dark to that dark thought life.
Searly the fase that my careers now in my careers.
You're one, I'm young, I'm young, amper to a little bit of age.
I can work in front of four decade of decade
Home probably will be what I'm going to have publish to the outside world as the world as the world as the work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We're with friends with friends on each other, so I can slow it up, highly likely to be my biggest success.
Yem, what a idea!
If you think about it, you're going to think, is you know, for the morning to the next hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me walked me with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work.
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after long thinking about the conclusion that I can only come through with writing if I protect a psychological screen in the process.
I have to write a safe distance between mediance between me, and my overigens very understand the very basics.
I have been looking at ways in ways to ways that do.
I'm doing in history and have a better history and have a better way to see if others have found a better way to see if others to help creative people to get to the emotional complications of creative process.
My seeched to me was browing me with the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let's say, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Gree-Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was not that creativity was going to be from henable.
And so believed that creativity was a good spirit was a good spirit was a lot of reason, unknowledge and unknow.
The Greeks now the Greeks of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he was a demoon who had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demand
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And they hear them was a geniused to creative spirit was a genius.
The fun, the Romeins with a genius,
In their policy was a genius, a kind of maginal entity that are ophion the ately of the ately of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artists was working on the genius,
And the regarber he gave shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first earlier protect to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is going to be in his work.
The artists was protect to protect to protect a lot of narcism.
If you brilliant work there, you got to be all the equire.
Everybody knew that a unvisible geniusible genius.
Well, you know, you work down the work of you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty inpenician.
Lige time is that was the Westen creativity was protected to the Westen creativity was considered to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed the Renaissance,
There was a very new idea of new idea of new idea of individual humans is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, increatures from the godness,
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believe that creativity completely from the individual completely came to the individual.
And for the first time in history was about artists artists said that they were not said that they were a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I think I have to find that a big faile.
On one person, one person single individual individual human beings that he or she she or she she or she was the essenti, the essentially basically made any a lot of responsibility for a lot of responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
As you ask somebody asks the sun asks in the sun of clicks.
Egos are remained to gigantic proportions and there's unimaginable high-expectations and prestations of prestations and express exprestations
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to an older the relationship between human between human and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of high-minutes in a 18 minutes of the real humanism in a 18 minutes of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of rational humanism in a minutes of humanism
Probably are in the audience people who remember in the audience of the idea that elphysical creatures with what feeds with what feeds with the work of artists work to inspiring artists to inspiring heights to inspiring artists to inspiring artists in the audience of artists in the public reading ben
It doesn't seem to get me to you.
And yet I ask it me.
Why not?
Why don't we have that thought that thought that thought to follow?
It just like a lot of highs as much as much as all other explanations of the totally close that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided to the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, in fact, and so in fact, you know, -- you know, the creative process -- you know, the creative process of the creative process of the creative process.
It sometimes almost paranormal.
I have understanding the great American close Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of American close Ruth Stone of American close Ruth Stone of the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American disacleging.
She's did in the neinside of the next her whole life.
She told me about her kids on the platounds of Virginia.
Sometime, if she was on the work, she fellow them on the close they have a close to the country.
It was said so, she said, "Well, there was a big wave air came air of air.
And then the close waves of golf than the country to her her it.
She felt that the ground, the ground her feeds started to shake her on that moment but one thing that her on that moment to do is just one thing to do to her life.
And she went home, and she had to go through the close and she had to see a possible and paper and paper and paper and pick up and paper and pick up with the close and she had to see sweeks.
When the close was close by her her waves was her only her enonly her enonly her to write it was her enonly through her was her to write it was her to write it was her ended her end, and her her the opportunity to write it was a lot of opportunity to write it was close to
Sometimes she wasn't enough.
And then running and run, but reached it doesn't reach the house.
And in such moments schools the close of her heavy about the field, on search -- in her words -- to another director.
And then there were a little bit of -- this is the beautifully the story -- that they are the close to almost mistake.
And then she was in the house looking for paper and paper and paper and piece of her its it.
Juist on that moment she had a pot-lect calize it was to pick on the podge.
And with her other hand, so told me she poem from the air.
She picked up with his reason his body, and put it back in her body, while she wrote the written written the written again.
In that cases came to be a lot of paper in the case of paper and paper but then it was in the close follow.
When I heard that hear, I thought -- what happens to be my creative process of creative process ever --
And my creative process is what I do! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mileself, who are every day on the same time, every day, sweating and it with blood, sweating and trans out there.
But even in that day swoods I have had a experience of experience.
You can also know it myself to know that there are creative ideas in your opportunates in your opportunities that you can can identificate that you can can identified.
What is that source?
How can we use the without that we are get?
And in a way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think I can think is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the reason this.
And in fact, a big part of his life has been a big, the showed of the amazing artists that resources from all the power that try to get the unity-in-in-basicable creative impulses that increative impulses in him.
With the years, the years, the years,
And one day, he read in Los Angeles about the speeag, and changed the process of radical.
And as he reard there was so required a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided is like inspiration that is doing that it does, understand the course.
It was a nice called and he wanted to the vasthing.
But that went doesn't be that.
He had no paper too, no paper to be a tape of paper in itself.
The amazing exciting exciting the melo's wrong again, "I went the melody is remaining the melow century.
I'm not good enough I can do it right."
He was not real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the hind the hind the whether it do?"
"Do you really know that I can describe now to write a song of writ?
If you really want to get that this song you have to later another thing like I have to have to do if I have time.
Now, not, won't go to anybody else.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohent." And from from that moment the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Cohent." And from the performance of the percent of Leonard
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar subject subject.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him in him in him when he distantively distanced from the genius.
It was closed to close the skin and listed it up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through to go through to through it.
It could be a wonderful business, bizarre together, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own aspect that not all the Tom was that not all the Tom was a myself was not all the Tom myself was a kind of conversation that was not really a w
That story has changed my way of work changed.
I've been a profound.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle, Bime, Bime,
And I think about a give moment in spending in spire of woop.
You know that well, you want to work and you don't want to do good and you think it is a terrible ramp of the bad book ever well.
Not simply bad of the bad bad bad of bad bad bad of the bad of the bad of the summid.
I wanted to do the entire project.
And then I remember Tom that Tom that are enjoy who did to be a point to be a point to way.
I wish me from my manuscript and direct me to a legger to me to a leg-origins of the room of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know this, we know all know that if this book, we know all this book, it doesn't just through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop what I have in me.
More can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it can, you have to do you come to do.
Do you don't know that? Doo you don't know you, right?
I just write down because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notes, and in the notory are going to be a different, on the office are difference."
Tja--- U., it's coming here on the room --
Euws ago, there was in the Northern African desert people to spend together people to dance in the North African music.
And then hours and hours and hours to the morning.
That was always because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometime, very smooth thought about something that happened.
One of that dancers was transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you also see you have ever seen a performer.
It was like the time and the dance was standing and the dance through a poor.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights but now fail together.
And suddenly he didn't seemed a human beings.
In him, under him, under him gly.
A good fired fired hour.
And if you did something like this, they did people what it was Dan was going to started to clap them and in charge, "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, and the Moren South Spana Spana consistance of them with me.
The demands is real through the centuries, changed from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, Ole every one of office is od."
That hold you today to died, the day in died and flamengodances.
If a artist, in Spanine something impossible or magically does, "Allah, Oh, Oh, Oh, old away again, Allah, braravoice bravo."
One equive, sice: a glimpse of God.
People what we need to need.
Lastig is the dance that the dance morning the next morning that he discovered that he did on dincluding the next morning lady didn't have a good chard's not a good chard more than the next morning to the next morning to the next morning
And on that moment is he'll come a little older man with past, which is that may never going to come to such more that may never comes to come to be able to come to be able to come to be able to come again.
Maybe never to be more anybody God anybody God anybody dance.
What needs to be the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to show to show for creative spirit for creative mind.
But so painful needs to be the way.
And imagine that you don't go to the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of yourself.
And imagine you believe it that you have a while of a which, you know, a little bit of a bit of not took a specificate to specificate to specificate that you have to be able to specificate them a which,
When you ready are ready to somebody else.
And so protect it is all the time.
I handle inside that thought about thought to me.
The last months I've been working on a book, that is going to be different. The book, the book, the book, where many of reach to have been looking at is extension to the last months
The real real progression of that illustrated.
If my thoughts with me to the hold me to the same pretty the same thing, Don't be the same thing. Don't opposition.
And the business you work.
You just do this, you just just what it is.
If you are today, if you dance, went to dance.
If the good genius, you know, decide that you are decided to take in your work on enious point to probably through to probably "Ollen."
And it happens not, then, thank you very much through.
And then, "Ole !"
I believe that heart.
"OK!" how it all again, because we keep out of pure human love and own wisdom by continue and own in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovered.
We actually start actually start from a new point: we were the digital code biology to digitalize the digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology and synthetic designs of life.
So we tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions.
"What is liv?" And what I think I tried to understand what have trying to understand on different levels in different level.
We tried to have different approach to minium componenty to minimum components.
We're almost 20 years on the digitalize of digitalizing
When we have sequenceed, it was from the analog world of the biology world of the biology, to the digital world.
Now, we try to ask life is to regenerate life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small of a kind of that can be able to human being a kind of that can be able to human being in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nice smaller genome.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or that are 500 or so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively simply with the in.
Geleve, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we look at all the genes we can look at a live count of the lives that this would be a living cell lived cell that this would be a living cell cell of the cell of the genes that we can look at the genes that we can look at the live ckely to be able to be a lived called a live cell that it would be a lived
We decided that the only route prevent that was the only route this chromosphere, so we could take the components so that we could take the components to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions
And so are we started with questions with questions are we going to start a chromosphere?"
Stails the chemistry the chemistry making moleculen that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can do a chromosphere?
A chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemical inerial.
So, our tempo of digitalizing life is on exponential well.
Our possible to write the genetic code of write -- but is really, but is generated to be genome.
And our last point would be the moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a city, to start to start with a bio-ethical tsing tooling for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of thousands of DNA makes, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it's a degenerative process, the more more more folks that longer you make it more fail.
So we had to do a new method to society of these little little pieces of these little little pieces and the corrigerators of all the phistaks.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, the bice corrective.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the transmits when we piece in the bacteria stopping in the bacteria of the genetic code genetic code and the bacteria picture.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they came back from the cells, they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was under the oil industry, and I said that they were just saying that they just said that they just said that they just too good snake.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this situation in which is a situation where the software o-hardware own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromospsphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes in the size of viruses, so we could defish the cassettles.
to go to understand what the real components of a livth cell are of a living cell.
The design is critical information in the computer than digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accurame.
When we first put together this genome of together in 1995 was the standard precision is one fault 10,000 baseparate a 10,000 baseparate of the same time.
And finally we found after 30 failures 30 follows. When we had the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start in the original sequence.
And the design is the design is the design is the designs that have to be overlapping out that have to overlap that have to consider 50 letters to build so they can do it so that they can design so they can design so they can design so they can go together.
We designed unique unique parts of the designs here.
Maybe you have read to you read that we are in stopping water in stop.
And think, we have a square genetic code: A, C, C, Deah, C, and T.
Trio's from those letters of those letters for ruwletters -- that there is a long attack for every aminozero for every aminozer.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words thoughts.
And then we only called "The basically,
Some of them were countering that there were no poems were not poems were not poems
We have designed these pieces that we can eating them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repairs and they put in each other.
And we started to make pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were longs long long time, and you have pieces that were pieces of 24,000 letter, take up to 7,00000.
In each stages we could have a conferences to these pieces of these pieces because we want to create a process that we want to create a process that is going to strake.
We try to reach the point of automatician.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketbal.
And as we get to come to the big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparpars -- then they don't grow easily more in E.
And that is the exploring of all the modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to be able to be the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombination, it's used by the biology to repairs by the biology to repairs that pieces of DNA can feet.
Here is a precious example of it.
There's an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million raid to straling to straling to stralize the square.
And you see that in the top panel, she looks like chromosphere.
12 obvious later he was going to put it away in each other, like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely opinion.
They can live in a vacuuum life.
I know absolute sure that there can find that life in space that can find moves in space that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has married shows that there's a lot of of it, there.
Here's a basically micropphero-own micropphone of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact with the right design of the right design of the right design of the right design.
Got care of it makes automatically continuous together.
This is not an electronen-microscope pics; this is a coming microscope.
It's such a big, molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we invent indeed.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million three million three million
If we would press the pressures with a 10-points letter, without spations, there is 142 pages to present the genetic code for the genetic code of the genetic code
Good, how do we start a chromosphere? How do we activate it?
And with a virus is the clearly easily.
With a lot of complicated to be a lot of complicated.
It's also simple, if you give to you under eukaryots, like us, and you just like this: you just know the cell and doing a different in, and that's what you know if it like the cell you know if it ks.
And in the bacterial types of chromosphered in the cell integrated in the cell transplant to a complete transplant of a chromosplant to a chromosplant to a different, and it can active.
We have a chromospending a chromospending a microbbened.
These are about so far as far as far as people and micked micent as people and micked mic.
We figure out some extra genes so that we could select for this chromosphere.
We have the referened with enzyms to make all the egs to make all the egs to make all the egs of the egs to make all the egs of the egs of the egs to make all the egs of the egs of the egs of the egs.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to be just to show it would come to develop the process of developing it to develop.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of a second chromosphere, or a third or a third generating thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution to imagine evolution equivalent to change biology have changes to be a lot of biology coming to be a lot of biology have changes that evolution evolution.
There are enzyms that restriction are enough who are really called DNA realized DNA rearts.
The chromosome that in the cell has not every much has not either.
The cell -- the chromosome, the chromosome.
It was expression, and the recognize the other chromospsped, and it was a strange material, and it up up and therefore, and why we had the new chromosphere.
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in it we had stop.
And in a very short time disappeareas of the corporates of the one of the new kind of completely in the new kind of based in the new kind of based on the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software that we stop in the cell of the new software that we stopped in the cell of the new software of the new software that we stopers in a little bit of the new software all the new software of the new software that we stop.
All the egived changed the genetic code -- when we changed the genetic code of the genetic code in which change.
This may sounds like genomic, but we're in standing alchemistry, but we're in the change of the software DNA, to change things that change DNA, to change things
And so I have a little based before this is not a skulty -- this is a break -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have a new version that we may be a new version of the Camblosion of the Camblosion that there are huge scale new species that there are in this digital design.
Why would you do?
And I think it's free to the free-business if you look at what it is.
We're going to take a half to six-half to 9-billion people, during the next 40 years.
To place it in my context place: I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planeets.
for each of us that in 1946; within 46; within 40 years that there will be four four bear.
We have a defician, with the skin the skwater, medicine water, medicine burn of six-on-half billion a half billion of a half billion of a half billion of water,
That's going to be distance.
We use five billion tons of collects, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the genschool or any percent than any perceive to replace; it will be a huge challenge challenge of biological process.
And of course, of course, all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes back in the atmosphere is coming back in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming a carbon dioxide of the cuts.
And though our worldwise all of our worldwish now we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see if the designs for the future.
The electronics had just been doing a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
We're pretty concerned by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now fairly fast, thank you very quickle synthesize so called "combination genomics.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the 20 million different genes thinking about the processes or trying to optimize octoptimize or or medicine octan, new vaccine, new vaccine, we can change more molecular biology than we can do more molecular than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vaccess, chemical or production, vaccinproduction, vaccine production, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real designs that we work on work on that we work on the comes to the gang and a new kind of the computer, and a new kind of the computer.
We don't know how it will see it going to see the way from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of genetic code
We are now on the fourth generation.
One of you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation fuel that are going to come from coming out from coming out of the comes out of digit like sugar fuel like octan.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have biology without the food price without the food as we start to do with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and therefore we think that big way that we can design it in the way that we can do it in the way that we can do it in the way that we can do the first squares that we fuel like we can do the first squareaves that we can have the food.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovered -- but we have all sorts of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods of other methods and CO2 is one methods and CO2 is one methods and CO2 is one methods and CO2 is one method and CO2 is one methods and CO2 is one methods and CO2 is a methods and CO2 is a method and CO2 methods --
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepzee, about 2.5 miles put up in the same dep, with cool.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen like energy sources.
We can look at the fast or we can take CO2 -- what easily is easily via pipics can be back to fabring to fabring to fuel this process.
So in a short time we think we are thinking that we are able to breads on the basic question question question question question to the basic question the basic question of the basic question of the basic question to be able to breads on the basic question of the basic device deploy?"
We actually have a real, you know, -- you have the skulls the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED can do, where then well?
A important energy source becomes
But we work now to use these works of working like these works to make speeds.
This year was the flu was the flu just just something behind the facts like the funning on the right now on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change through vaccine.
Here you see the future of the future of evolution is going to change evolution is going to change the future of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually eventually archeaeukaryota.
We're still away from the humans.
And our goal is certainly to concerned a chance to survive long enough to do that may be able to do that may be a long enough to do that may be a chance you well.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to a new technology that we are about a year ago. This is Sedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment that you local local or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work work on the burn.
We look at this many gigabytes here to digital images and can stay in the room and then may be able to keep and the sort of the sort of and the sort of the sort of the wish.
And it doesn't matter from how much information, how big these collections or images or images are going to be able to be the collections or images.
Most of his normal digital camera photographs, but this is a small the Library of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapix.
It makes not all from the exactly what the prestations would have been influence, on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of the data.
This is the graue home by Dickens. Every collect is a head.
And to prove that it really text is actually text to do something like this, and we can do something like this, to show you that this really text is a real thing.
Maybe this is a little bit of strange of a book.
I wouldn't required it to be a lot of this.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a particular part.
This gives you really real the pleasure and the experience of a magazine or capite or capital is actually a scale medium medium is a scale medium medium is a scale medium is the pleasure of the room medium is the pleasure of the real experience.
We also have done with the core of this extensive of the Guardian.
We have a nep advert advertising higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising extra normal advertising information information -- and we have extra nice.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car sees you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limities of handle the screen through the screen of handles.
We hope that this is not means a hop-ups more and other thing, and other thing.
Of course to the hand a country to hand gene application for a technology like this, I'm going to spend a technology like this, I will not contributed to this field that we can contributs.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And the picture, on top of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is married now on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision from Washingt-research of Washington the Washington Washington of Washington Steve University University Seitz on University
and Rick Sself Rick Sself Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon the Web.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experience.
The space of the space has meaning the space.
The computer vision algorithms have been continue to panside these pansion with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they genomes are genomes of stabilized diashinside diasht diashws or panorama and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there's time to show or there's time to show you a different surround.
There are a lot of space.
I want to like to do a Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth that we work this summer, and this is the working -- to communicate what I in my heavy in my head is the real powers in the environments in the website.
We had to hold to the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dadid with Flickr. You look at Flickr. You look at Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the c
And each of these orance, every single pictures that part of this model of this model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of model in the model of this model of the model of this model of model in the birth.
And so are all Flickr images, which are all these Flickr in space that are spaced.
And we can cape on simple avignors
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would have ever work.
It's consider to be so amazing here to be so remaining here.
I believe you can see that these many types are many types to be cameras to mirror to the mirror to the mirror cameras, a big number of them.
I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so much more demight through faces and like this.
Ergencing in this, even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dage Daesesor is also goodged by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really can do is that we can really do things with social environment. This uses now the data -- from the whole of everybody -- the Earth -- and buy the Earth -- and buy it all the time, the Earth -- and buy it all the time.
And all these pictures are being inside of the particular of the particular of the parts.
You've got a model that from the entire Earth earth of the earth Earth is the whole Earth is the entire Earth is the earth of the entire Earth has been a model that Earth earth.
And this as a considered on Stephen Lawler's work work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity, when it uses the uses of the benefits for the people who used to use the people who used it.
Their own pictures are present from metaphor.
If somebody would like to attack all these saccess, and their names and invotes, my picture of the Notre Dadid Dase, and I can use it like a concerned access to that metaph, which metaphold of anybody pictures, and creater momentire social smistaker of any modal, and creating art.
And of course, the continue product here, is a rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who didn't only from the air, who are not only from the collective pictual images is discuss from the collective memory
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what your software possible to a day, on a day, in the next years, all the images that are deviolence on the world can be able to anybody on the world together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates creates, hyperlinks between hyperlinks between images.
And the doing that basis of the data in the picture.
And that designed exciting when you think about the richdoing when you think about the richdom of semantic information that mantic information that many of these images.
When you look at the web to the web to images, you look at the web and the text on the web page, and the text on the webpage, and the text picture.
What if you have this image is the images that are all your image?
Then the number of the number of the basic connect to the amount of rise that comes out of the realm of the realm networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible.
One of the intense pleasure of the intense of edity and research is the possibility to life between them, who are not forgets the old coming the old wind the ancient in regular basically in the windown in the wind plans in the profound in bitters of the properly swindown.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still remember to the Milky of Iner-parents, or the Iner-parents of Iner-parents of Iner-parents or that in the Himalaya breath, or remember on the bremember of Dharma, remember to the world in which we really live remember life in which we remember life in which we are not in a bit is a model of world in the world in which we are deal to the work of the working of the working of the working sount sounds of the world in the work of the world of the Mell of Intermesn't ready of the MMMMMMelecong world in the Himboot sount sount sount sount
the consequences of a set of the set choices that are made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all shared the same tape every same true of Worth. Brenes kids in the world.
We all do increating rites.
And in the inconnect to the inconnect through the board.
So it can't be surprising that we sings, dances and art and art and art and art art and art
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is going to be the Penan in the wouldn't have the Voo-acology in Haitis in Haiti, or the rice in North Kaisut-burgs in North Kenya, the Curchano in the Andes-business in the Saharan in the Saharan -- this is the man with the Sahara. -- -- this is the month of the month of Qomain the hell-magine of Qomolangma long--ma,
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They are all us to think we can think we can think we can think different, our otherwise, otherwise can think of the earth can orious origin.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of its this.
Shapes the untelable cultural cultural and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that the planet and the her and for her as the biological life-Web: the biospir.
This cultural life-web you imagine your eeetc.
The eeath you can definial finial as the total of all the thought dreams, mythes, mythes, mythes, ideas, inspirations that are put in the human image since the beginning of our consciousness of our consciousness.
The eeath is the big nalatence of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all that we can be amazing and all that we can be amazing amazing news of the animal.
like the biosphere is the biosphere is the eath face that ever -- and in much greater mate.
And a biologist would take a half that least half of all species on the point of all kinds of the extincluding half because that simply not where is simply not where is that is simply not true.
And right, the most apocalyptical scenario is not even in the neighborhood comes in the neighborhood diversity.
The best indicator of this, the loss of the long languages.
When everybody here was born here was born there were sixth thousand languages on Earth --
A language is more than her words or her grammatic rules.
A language is a classocial of human souly.
It's the basically that the soul of every unique culture the material world world is reaching the material world
Every language is a disturborn, a skull, a skul, a disside ecosystem to spiritual opportunities.
And from sixth thousand languages today half of thousands of fluence.
They're not longer aw.
Effectively means that it is a change that they are death to change that they are death to be death.
Is there something that is a little bit of the reason to be the last of your people, the last of your people, and your language, no chance to have a chance the wisdom of the ancestors of the children or the importants, or the reward?

And on this point is the intuition is very important.
If we think about indiculations and landscape, and we often think Rousu of the ancient fable, and the old fabely wanted to be a idea that racistic in his simpl.
Or we have Thoreau and say that these folks closer at the Earth than us.
Indicines are nor sentiment, nor fooms by nostalgic.

It's a picture that I have april you.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive active computation from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaasca is so fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it. It's built from two sources of two sources.

If you take the plant takes it out that a blue rookwalm through your consciousness through your consciousness.
The plant is mix, mixt with leaders of a coffee being a coffee of Psychotridis.
The plant powers powerful tryptamines, because of brain resociated because of brain diases fiely methyltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.

That pooder your nose is like this, as a shot of shots are being inside with barokage, to countries on a sea of electricity. This ships not a shape of the reality.
I tried to my professor, Richard Evan Shults, convincing -- a man who was discovered the psychediscovered by his dediscovered by his dediscovery of psychard in the 1930s.
I meaning that these tryptamines are not to identificate as hallucinerend, because when the effect is intricking his indecided to experience. Nobody is hallucination to experience. Tryptamines are not oral edangers because they designed their effect in the human darmous canal: monoxida: monoxiday oxida.
They can only oral oral with something that the monoamine of the monoamine of the samine of the samine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the samine of the monoamine of the moment.

Well, the problem is that even the problem is even the sympathy of us that sympathy of indicularly folks like curious and show to a foot in history and colorritical world in history in the history of the history of our world, means desports.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years of not remembered to be his war or technological innovations, but first first of the time we innovited and active active participle of the biological and active particips of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always particultures to a dance of life possibilities.
Techtechnology is also the problem not.
The Sious indians not Sious Sious when they stopped their pile, just as the Americans stopped Americans stopped Americans when they stopped their purpose and ways were doing their purples and way.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the eedition of the eedition.

And one day they put per incident on a poorband of Mao. For this continued them seven years of windown.
The pain of Tibet can be until the piece of Tibet is something to be able to fast.
And finally it comes up to a choice.
Will we have in a figure world of sumness or want to live a colorrich world of diversity of diversity
The big anthropology Margaret Mead said that she said that she peace that she direction.
We wouldn't just the human imagination are going to see the smal, but we would have been able to be able to be able to put and forgets are also there and forgets that there are other options that there are other options of the options are going to be there.
We can feel to feel us feel in the idea that our kind of pass about the idea that our kind of pass on Earth --
The Neolicicical Revolution, which we found us that country to the cult of the seed, when the poster of the shaman being the shaman became replace by the proza specialization and shot a specialization through specialization was only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface this surface history is not the idea that we don't have the idea that we have all the answers in all the answers that we have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to the meaning of humans are asking with 10,000 different votes with 10,000 different voices.
And the thing that song that we are going to be able to discover to be what we are going to be a following what we are going to be able to be a full of the work to all the sequences and all the tugs. There are greater moments of optimism.
This picture on the north point of Baffin Island genomes, when I went with Iner's narrowing with Iner's narrowing on narrow.
This man, Olayue, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Iner. In the years, and they were going to be our soods, to required our soods, in the corred in the corre.
The opa of Olayuk to go.
The family of his life and afterterters and discovered him all his tools and discovered him all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Infrom the collaps; they made it down the colle; they make it use.
The glish icians were originally made of their break in charibooms of fish in cararibooks.
Olayuks opera was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that wire wire walking on the storm that wire real.
He went outside his broak of sea sskins and poops and pooths and put the pools in his hands. And he started to freezing, shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a lot of the side of the side of the mess.
And then the solid was, slaught a dog me.
He did the dog and improvision a harnas.
And the rible benearly he made a base.
He was a dog in the neighborhood and disappearing about the ice flat, including poops.
Over the nones are so. And this, in many opportunity, many opportunity, standing symbol for the Invent and all the indicularly full in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government government is the entire country greater than California and Texas Texas sheet Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's independent area. They represented all the grounds.
It's a continue example of how a national enough to her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly the clearly is at least for who is at least for who is true to this home of the world is not going to be far away away away away away away away away away away to this home is not going to be able to the clearly clearly not away away to this home is not a clearly not away to this home is not going to be able to be able to be away away from the world to this highly far as well.
They're mands of home land.
They're standing for the human imagination, which is going to go back to the beginning of time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just like the the dreams of the unclean uncleaning show.
What we finally do to National Geographic, is extension of the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic, we think that a polemic, but we don't think that stories are not convincing the world, but we probably believe that stories the world, which we probably the best of the world. Our website 35 million times a month three million on TV and in 156 countries on TV and our times a million public.
We make a lot of regular resources to the eedge of the public cultural places that the same thing that the moment that the moment that she seeing through what he seeing is so hopefully the most important opening around the anthropology will go to the anthropolicy of the world: that this world in difference in difference in difference in a multural of life in a multure, and plure world and plure world in a plurbit world in a plurbit of the most important world of the makes that we can make sursurprissue of the makes to livical plical world of the set of the might be able world in differenearound the
where all the way of the entire entire entire to contributting to us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question that I individual.
Maybe you see paralls you to information from other sources.
I try to explain a little bit of you may have mistic.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly the official dogma of all western seemed together.
And that official dogma like, as follows as follows on the highest level of our neighbors on the highest level.
Freedom is a great deal, a essential part of the human existence.
And it straight freedom to reach us to hands to hands to own insight, to accuttribute to reach without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
Morchen choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means of automatically more wonderful wonderful to be more wonderful wonderful
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take a little bit would take a during during nobody would have been during in our society.
And in our lives is a bit of death, this dogma bit of regular.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. It's a means of big.
Even thressing.
And in the next 175 can-break three of the supermarket, there are in my supermarkets, in my supermarkets, and different balsamicoil and different balsamicos and 2200.
And that can make you courage numbers own drive the case of the case that are 175 species for you.
So that's the point of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can imagine stroneoset of stroneoset of -- air player, cassettespecially distance.
And so you can choose one electronics you can choose out of this attack from this attack.
You can six-en-half million different systems with parts of the parts of that realls with parts of that reall.
Give too -- then you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young was, long ago, you could all sorts of phone services and all kinds of Ma Bell.
You don't sheevel it up. You don't show it it it doesn't have the sky.
And that had the fairly failable to be the front of the equipiece of it.
That time is prevent to it.
Today are very much different stream.
And in cell cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with middle mile, now her and crene-buried and crere-burn.
Wellight you have this model in the wink of the wink, but you can make sure that that that happens indeed.
The consequence, people are going to come to the wink and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer to the answer question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a possible that doesn't do.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the society of spulling is this explosive increase of choices of choices
Gealth carcare, it's in the U.S. It's not inside the U.S. including the doctors you tell.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do A do, or we can do, or we can do.
As has this formal and nadeliver.
And then this is the obtains and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what finds do is what finds do?"
And the doctor, "Am has this present, and nadels, and nadelivers this presents.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you're not."
And that is we call "self inbring the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, the slight of decision of the decision -- the doctor, to a leak, somebody who are certainly dividual to a decision has to sick decision to decisions, the patient.
Good protect that ners, because the purpossible group, because the purpossible group, you can't buy it.
Why do we make it doesn't buy them?
Because they think we are thinking that we think we are the next morning to ask that other marks to ask that other markets.
Our idents, yet, yet a bit of us existence, is now consider the choices, as you can see on this slide on this slide.
Our identity is going to be able to be the background.
We find ourselves -- so often we just like this.
Every every morning to the opposition you want to think about what you want to be to be to invite what you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family of the marriage.
There is a time that freedom of everybody else that you were all automatically as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did doesn't when you did the deed.
Now is freedoms for the surface for the oprap.
I give you leave lesson intelligent students, which I have 20 percent less housework less house,
They're not domber or or or like, or longer times in early time.
No, they have drugs with choices.
"Well, I marrief or not? And I now marries?
Or I will wait? Now, I will go to children, or a career?"
These are all the time.
And they go through to them, as a response as this means that they don't have all their homework and therefore not a good corred and there's no good corred to them.
And they have right. They're important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just just the technology is to work us to work every minute every minute every minute -- capture in the world, cept in the Randolph Ho.
There is a married one place, which I keep WiFi do.
I don't want to be true, because I want to keep place for me.
But good, that huge choices of work kept in that we are going to work us to ask us on the whether we're going to work, or now whether we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a footballwed to look at the son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they are all from standing up all of the competition of that competition with all kinds of the wedid question?
And I show on this emailt respone? And I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the footballwed the footballws of our son a very different way.
Where we look at it, the group, the small of materialistic bags, lifestyle, lifestyle, life is a question of choose.
And this is what the world is going to be looking like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world is now the world looks like this.
The question is now well?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we know is good about it, so I'm going to go to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two effects on human effects on human.
A very except effect is that the long position than completely is the basically before.
And so many choices are impossibilities people to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigations in function, a research of investments in front planns.
A colleaguary of me got to invest to invest data of Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million working with about one million worker 2,000 basically spread about 2,000 buries.
And she discovered that for every 10 percent fundred the work of the work of the work of the particular two percent of the demand the particular two percent of the work of the demand of the particular two percent of the work of every depicture.
And in fifth funds of five percent less works, less than five five five five five five five five five five fund.
Because it in fifths is so did to choose that people are just existence to choice to the next day, and so forth, and so forth.
And from existences from the field.
And that means not only that people after their pensioned not dream dream because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money that the choice was so dislast, it was that she was working on the work-to-did she's working for shoot she was going to shoot a drags shore that means have been doing the pensiong.
And that she was going to be a 5,000 dollars a year on their nose before to go to their nose for go.
The work was namely to double.
So a lot of choice can work lost a lot of choice.
And I think the world is looking like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make very much the right choice makes the right choices -- right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundress the wrong thressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect. And the lamong effect. And then finally less text less text less the result of the result of the result of the result as we had less options like we had less sure to be less options as we had less options as we had lear.
There are multiple reason for it.
And one of the choice, for instance, for instance, for instance, back that the choice, the choice can't keep perfect.
You straight have been in such a case for that another choice would be better.
This is dried alternative alternative to the choice for your choice.
And the speak of the choice of choice that you have made you made it was a good choice that you have made a good choice.
The more options of them are there, and easier to have the easier to have easier to have every eight ach easier option.
A second reason has to do with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert coming morning to the value of things that let things let depends of the things we depended them to compared them to compared them to compared them to the value of things that we are compared to the value of things that we depends on the value of things that we deput them on the value of things that we depended them to the value of things that we are compared them to the valu
If you can inthink of many alternatives you can see all quickly see the attractive of all the alternatives you can deed.
That makes you have less tevach to the alternative that you have choses.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example.
This is a basically on the Hamptons.
They have a little bit second a little bit of wound.
They are going to be wonderful strand. Straling weather. Go human beautific.
Don't do it? "To can't think this? "Dikie" that man, "It's augstus.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city out.
I could do my carbon the door, I could parker."
And he is too simply simply with the idea that he every day again, every day parking place walk out of the idea that he walks on the idea that he is walked every day of the idea that he is basically wonderful ep every day speak to simply a great parking place that he is going to be a great parking place that he was every day basically basically bas
Substitution costs are going to be cost of the entire choices that we have from our choices that we have a great choice
The more possibilities are more possible alternatives.
And those presentors are presents.
Another example.
This pictures to a couple of points.
Like in the way here and now you don't have to continue things that you don't have to continue to continue to the things that you don't have to consistance, and you don't have to concept things that you don't have to continue things that you don't have to constance, and for instance, and for instance, and for instance, and for instance, and you don't have to constance, and you don't have to concept things in the wor
And another thing is that you have the choices with every choices except the choices
And all that other has so his attractive cans, which the coopers that resources less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expeciutation.
I came up with this new break to a new broek.
I always speak always speak to the brow.
Because it was only one kind of speek, and it was bought your dance, and it was incredibly understanding uncommuned incomfortable, but if you were the broke long enough and often enough and often enough and often enough the totally OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a speak to a speek, this is my makes my make.
And the store, said, "Wilt you fit cle, easy fit easy fit e?
Do you know whether a ritis? Wilt you stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed?
Do you have a break with sisish?
Wilt you have something expensive pipipion." And so he went pipion." And so he was just down.
I was going to speak from a time, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "
He had no idea that was that was, and so I have a hour long all the possible brows on the long brows of all the brow.
And it is honest, I left the wink of a bit of pass a bit of pass a brow.
I had better thane. I could do it better. I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To do this on myself out of myself to be a book.
The reason I don't feel better felt that I started to expect more to expect to expect the so.
I started without to expect without any because I think of a bit of a break know.
And then then it turned out there were different and one of the fast, and one of the fast.
What I was bought I was good, but not perfect.
And so I think of my break with my break with my expectations, and that stated.
The more possibilities have more possibilities to expect the services of those possibilities.
And that means people are less text less texts, even if the good results are good results to be good results are less to be good results with results are less to be less texts.
Marketings don't know this way.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about now
