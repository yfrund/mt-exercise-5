Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polar cap, that the last three million years of the last three million years of the U.S. and had about the size of the U.S.
But this underestimate the most of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disease of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it is not the disecurrently of this particular problem because it doesn't ship the disease of the ice.
The ice cap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It put out of the winter and cracing in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dipushed in red.
As you can see, it set out of dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And it cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, or five years or older, is almost like blood, that is almost flower, which is from the body's body's five years here.
In 25 years of this went from this to this clear this.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icell warming around the North Icelity warming carbon classrorn carbon carbon diase, when it was deed, deed, by microbes of methane.
Carred to the total amount of entertainly across the atmosphere, could double the amount of the corner of the corner point.

Whoo! She's OK. The question is that we will be going to be that we will be
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt of show.
The water than ever bigger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua's sua-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal piece because the landics meless is because the landice where it comes in the sea place where it comes in the sea.
These strops are taking up to take the corporate of this.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the planet, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And last months month reported scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance balance balance balance.
More specifically is the ice in the West of the South Pole very quickly at the melting, with a few underwaters --
The whole continent is six feet of six feet sea legactiful, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the only two after greatest ice mass, there are new now new now that are a few years ago, which were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of the melus,
In the Andes, this glassing the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, disappears to the drink water.
In California was a reduce of 40 percent in the snow.
It comes back in the water reservoires.
And as you could read it, are the predictions of it.
This global drought has led to a dramatic rise of forests.
And the number of nature around the world is crossing with an incredible and never seen speedness.
Four times in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely intentially intention.
And if you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 at CO2 24 hours.
25 miles of miles every day in our oceans, Look at the eye of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, west, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drastic drift in the oceans.
The only great cause, the only great warming of the Earth, next to 20 percent money is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and step carbon is a problem of this.
The United States is one of the two greatest extension of the greatest china.
And there was a propossible of more cool carbons.
But we see a reverse --
These are the spending carbon central centrals, which was annulearned in the last few years, and where green alternatives were presented to the last few years.
There's a political battle on the country.
The steone carbon and oil industraight year, 250 million dollars to promoting clean "clean carbon clean carbon cleannesses.
And that image me about this.
Around the currently was in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of galler power.
You probably see the news face.
This is the biggest display in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising carbon the crossling carbon the Kerst.
Video: "Well, Frosty the voice carbon guy, she was a blice, so,
He's overflension here in America, and he's concerned that our economy grows in America, and he's growing economy growing economy is growing in America, and he's a consider preference here.
Frosty the voice carbon guy clean clean clean to the day.
He's paid and cutting and cutting their job."
Here's a big part of the spite of the space in West Virginia from day.
The biggest mining the large basic is the great bigs of Massey Coal.

This is a piece of this.
Video "But, COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our things.
That is the reason why the most important goal is to give a giant goal to a giant through a giant to the light and transform the light of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of which is to give us a giant thing.
Fit is, steone carbon is not smar.
We find clean clean clean, and it smells --
So, you don't worry about corning corning cleaning change.
Let's just go on us.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean clean carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon clean carbon
Fantastic! The machines make best what law.
But that's the sound of sound,
Despite the fact that the fact that the fact that burning carbon of the global warming causes of the Earth, changes that remarkable clean cool technology that you see here.
Look at right, this is the clean carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Al Gore: I fitive alternative to our economic challenges and that on national security of national security.
Video: Stem: America in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red thing that is the red of all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like polate and inported oil.
But now a piece of new solution to get out of this.
Before America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America plan that safer is a plan that safer and warming the Earth curved today.
And eventually a solution that is correspond to solve our problems.
Repower America. Otttoo.
Al Gore: And the last thing.
Video: It is to give America reinded again.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of the fastest of old to our planet, view fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then nature -- New investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speak that says, "If you want to be a quickly.
If you want to go together."
We have to go fail and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here. So here's one of the ones that didn't have the most LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever subject in the correctly 27 kilometers in reverse.
It has to be the circumstances that were present less than a billion a billion after the universe after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, so,
This is the machine under Geneute.
We took photographs of that mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter -- 22 feet in diameter --
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in building so you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That careful for a party corner in the control.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all around the LHC went around the LHC went around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and pick in the detector.
In other words, when we saw see that photograph that photograph that the machine working, which is a huge over-win.
I don't know if this was the biggest room, or this, or this, or then, somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golds done with these golds did
And those wear behaviors 13 thousand amper totally worked on the full on full power on full power at full power and the machine on fulling 13 thousand amper cheating ago.
The engineers are going to say, "Not that are too small weight."
They can do that because they're superceive on all the low temperaturs.
So at min 271 degrees of space between the stars, that can draw down the stars, who can draw down the stream of the stars,
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was something that was a little bit warmer, and was incredibly once that was a thousand against 13 thousand amper camper true of 13 thousand amper called the 13 thousand amper cheks.
This was the result.
This is still impression if you realizing your realizing that the magnets more than 20 solid of away and they were about 30 centimeters.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out what we did.
We all have regularly regardless them.
Now they're back to away.
Eind message will be the LHC being intact.
We will put it again, and we expect measurements in June, so that we can figure out what the building blocks of the universe of the universe is the building of the universe of the universe is to be figure out what the building blocks of the universe to be figure out of the universe to be figure out of the universe to be further again.
Now, of course, that have unhappiness that the debate of the value of science started to research research. It's easy easy to research a way of course.
I think it's so hard to be so difficult, the fact that we go beyond beyond the value of the LHC.
I leave the last words on the last English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did the defence of the value experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this is what dangerous about the progress of affect than to take the age of the human spirit is completely in the winners are completely in the winners of the winners, and that our being completely are completely increase our governments of the new --
Thank you.
I would like to start ask to ask you back to your childhood at your childhood time, when you played with block.
When you discovered how to figure out how to grade it and conscious and conscious problems by learning and corporate space and corporate space and put of space relationship to be able to be able to be able to solve and depended up with and then hands of space and then how to figure out how to figure out to understand how to figure out to be able problems to be able problems to get to understand how to deal relations.
Rumultiply insight is a strong because understand the world to understand the world to understand it.
If an information of information -- inspired by the narrative interaction with objects -- together with my advised advising objects -- and my flabor, and my fellow Jee Kalanithi -- what if we could use a computer of digital fingers -- what if we could use a kind of digital fingers that ene mose of indicate mose to a plate with a place of blast, which moves we could use it with both indies a moves of information --
and orders can we live orders and orders can we like,
This question to put us so clear, that we decided to try to look at the building of Siftables.
Shortly is a Sift is a Sift a interactive computer in size of a cookie.
They can be moving with the hand they can be moved each other, they can put them up and contains a screen and wireless contact.
The physical accore is the physical trade, as blocks they can be moved by grade by grade to grain and grain and figure out of it.
And then Siftable, Siftable, of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
Before these tools have a more physical different of their movement and of the way we movement and even of the way we movement and even of the way we move, and even of the way we move, there are different new and funny new and funning new and fun.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is institute, to try to show a video celebrating a country and others; and othership played and played a little bit of the point of the point of cancery and played point to the point of a video clash.
These interactive portraits are conscious of conscious.
And then they are placed to each other, they will be interesting.
If they become surround, they can do this and can be able to be able to be able to be surround.
And they feel movement and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interesting of everyday gest, like it was a fluid of color as it was a liquid --
In this example three Siftables, and I can use them to go into a fail and I can use them to go into a empty where they are mixed to be mix.
And if we have drive, we pick up what we have back back.
There are some corporate cappe possibilities for education, mathematics and logics and logics that we want to give people the possibility that we want to try to try and try to see the result of the result of the result of education.
Here's a showing -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a simple programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmatic shes.
Here's a game that a cross-crossing is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every raround a rarbage letter on every Siftable, and form words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is a new series of becomes a new series of letters with a new series of letters with breakthrough bities.
Thank you.
These are some of the children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I put it out to make it out of it.
They were actually really, because of it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to nearly instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Make words" and they know exact what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the time.
That's our youngest basically test, right?
And seems to be just the Siftable.
For him was just a blocks.
Here's an interactive painting shown.
We wanted to learning a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
And he can bring new characters in the scene of the scene with that characters of the table.
He let let me come up with the sun here.
Video: The Sun comes up up to it.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the David Merrill:
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done though! Yeah!
By souldn't shape the next to shape the characters can reach the characters to reach other, Wally.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided how it walks down the walks.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I will show you that Is is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recent recent recent recent recent that we have recent recent recent recent a sound produces and drum.
One has been four different variations, where you can use what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftable, so that you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern of pattern by the attern of a leg Sift of a leg effects that are live controlled as reverble reverb and filter.
They are being a sound and added and added by side.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern of a pattern of extra lead.
Now, I put the basically, I put the basic.
Video: DM: Now, I feed a little bit slagwork.
Video: There's copple I can get the filter to the filter to the drums, so that I can influence live live in the effect of the effect of the effect of the drums, so that I can influencks.
Video: I can do it very accelerate the cancer of the cancer block of the block of block.
Video: DM: Now, I couple the filter to the basically for what more expression.
Video: I can reart the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to do everything to plann, but I can improvise it, but I can improvise it all longer and shorter as I want.
With the dims of the whole through the whole through the whole left to left left left to left left to left the dims of the whole through the whole thing that we have a view of the whole thing to cancellence.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion from the new human beings are still of new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces our brains and work.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with a new element of possibilities that we developing the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the touch of the touch is just a new generation of information with digital media, which bringing the information to the world as we want.
Thank you from heart.
I look at it to go out with you.
I'm writing now.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I have been securious and I don't think that that that that will change it.
And yet there is understood in my life and careers in my life and career, where I had to see my work with my work.
It started with a book that I wrote recently, a memoired memoired -- "Eten, Biinnen," that very opposed to my first world and before my first world went and a international existing world and a international bestseller.
And the result is that people now and always have to be pull as if I have to do it all the time.
Do really do what -- doesn't do --
People come to me and ask me and ask to me and ask you very scared that success this success never before you can never equivalen?
Do you don't get to write your whole life will be write you're going to write your whole life will be wright?
Don't you afraid there?"
Erightly reasoning, you know,
Of course, that would be very much I would be reminded that I was rather 20 years ago, when I was writing a teenager, if I was write I write.
People said, "Don't you afraid you will never be success you're never succes?
Don't you afraid for it.
Do you don't afraid you get your life on this work without of this work without of the broken and you'll die on the public fail of bitters with your broken bitters of bitter?"
Something in that stretch.
And in the short comes to the short answer to the questions of this: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things become.
Always all the time.
But I'm also much other things that all of a lot of other things that all of all of it.
For instance, and other end, and other end, and other end,
But what is concerned to write myself the last time that comes fear of the last time that comes fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is afraid to be afraid to the work that they put on the Earth is that they put on the Earth are show?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we worry to make the effects of the effects of the conception, something that is not happened to do the effects of work all work.
Now my father. He was chemistry, and I can't remember that there was a fix, and I can't remember that there was ever afraid he was asked to be afraid he was not afraid to it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, so became about it.
To be fair fair to be fair engineers have been by the centuries, also not the reputation of the reputation of piece of piece of being a piece of piece of being a piece of piece of being a piece of piece of being fair fair.
Writers well, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have subjectly instable.
Look at the grimmy declassed by the most magnificent spirits of the 20th century.
Many died young, often young, often by its own to do.
And even those of the ones that don't see suicide nururdering to be able to be concerned to be obviously.
In the last interview for his death said, Norman Mailer: "With of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a good thing to say about your life work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at anymore.
We've all heard it before, and have it all before it all the accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity infective is connected to suffering and that a artist, and that a artist, and that a artist,
So I want everybody here today, here today, is you can ask with that idea of lives?
Finds you now that OK?
Because I think about it now I think about it, I think it doesn't have pretty thought at all.
I think it is the refrigerate.
And also dangerous.
I would like to see that this century this century is going to go through this century.
We can spend a lot better to live better to live it.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly would be dangerous to live to the dark of the dark of thought life.
Searly seen the phase where my careers now on the ods.
OK, just after that, I'm young, amper safty a year.
I can may work a four decade of decades.
Heyast, probably will everything I'll get to get to the outside world as the work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up here with friends, so I can do it you probably likely to be my biggest success of my greatest success for behind me.
Jem, what a idea !
If you think, if you think of the things that you know the morning to be at the need hours to the need hours hours to the drink.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to love me work with the work I love to the work I love to the work I love to the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love to love with the work I love hold.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after long after a long time, that I can only go through a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a safe distance between me, and my overwhile, and my overwhelms being very much to my future to the reactions on my future publications.
I had tried to ways of doing it for ways to do.
I have been down in history and have depends in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to see a better way to help creative people to try to help creative people to get to the emotional complications of the creative process.
My question has brought me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Roman and believed that creativity comes from hendly itself.
People believed that creativity was a diviece, which was a divable place to humans around and unknowledge of unknowledable reasons.
The Greeks called these minds of creativity spirities of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon that was demoon that was demon that words influencky.
The Romeins had a kind of equal idea.
And so called them a geniused to be a geniused a "genius."
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, a genius,
In their promise was a genius, a geniused in the walls of the artist, of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artists was working on the work was working for the genius of assistence.
And he was working form shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was in his work.
The artists was so protection to the protection of a lot of narcism.
If you brilliant, you know, you came to get all the every high,
Everybody knew that a unseen, which is an invisible genius,
Well, you know, you work down a crown, that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time is that the way in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a whole new idea: the individual humans is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures from the divine world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely came out of the individual came to the individual
And for the first time in history was talking about artists before they were saying a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say honestly that I think a big wrong wrong faile.
On one person, one person, one person, one person, one individual individual is the bat, the essenti, the essenti, the source of the century mystery, of everything that is good to be familiar forward -- that is too much too much to a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks somebody asking,
Egos are blowing up to huge proportions and there are incredibly incredible high expectations of expectations of expectations and called
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists has made a lot of artists of artists and a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different this?
Can we understand back an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the humans and creative mysterious understanding back to the humans and the creative myself of the relationship between elderstanding age.
Maybe not.
Well we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of spech.
Probably sit in the audience people who have red reference to inspired about the idea that elphachieves of the idea that elphysics of the feeding artists of artists to inspiring artists of artists of artists of artists of artists are in the inspiring heights of the idea that are primary of artist
It doesn't seem to get to me you all get to you.
I won't ask it me down.
Why not?
Why would we have to do we can't do that thought to do that?
It's just so much wood as much well-explanations of the total intention of the total inaccountability that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have a try to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, all the presents -- it doesn't always the creative process is not always rational across rational process is not always rational process --
That sometimes almost paranoral.
I meeting the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American close of the great American close of the great American close of the great American close Ruth Stone of the great American close Ruth
She is close in the nine. Her whole life all of the before they close for.
She told me about her running Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was working on the field of work, she heard a poem on the country.
It was, as if there was saying, as if there was a big wave air came up with it.
And poem poem poem poem poem through the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, she was started shaking her feel under her that point her on that point to do that is just one thing that is stood for her life.
She was running home, followed by poem and see it possible and see paper and see paper and see paper and see paper and paper to pick up and paper and packing.
When the poem through her her her was golves her only to write it on the writing to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then running and running and running it running and running it running and running and running them.
And in such moments shot schools close by her her highs, looking at the fields, looking at another poets -- to another close -- to another close --
And then there were a message -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they have a poem -- that they have been poem almost beautiful.
And then she was in home looking for and paper and paper and poem through her it.
Juist that moment she had a pencil of pencil.
And her other hand, so told me she picked the poem out of the air.
She picked up the poem to its its the poem back in her body, while she wrote the crow.
And in that cases came up with the poem that follows in a very poem in poperation, but then in order order.
When I heard -- what I thought -- what happens to be down to be a creative process of the creative process of the creative process of it.
This is what my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, which every day on the same time, and standing up with blood, and sweat and trans blood, sweat and trans blood, swall.
But even in that day heard that day I've been such a experience.
You know, you're going to know it itself also that feeling that there are creative ideas in your course curreling you from a source that you can can identify you can identify include you.
What is that before to sources?
How can we use the without that we have been crazy?
On a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think I can think is musician example Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life had been dealing of the function of the avioral artists that result to get all the power to get on the uncontinue of the incontinue of the injuried of the injuries.
With the 1990s, and the 1990s,
On a day he refrigerated in Los Angeles, and changed the process of radical radical radical --
And as he went out there, he heard a fragmental of a meloddy.
It decided to him, like inspiration that field, ungry of it, understand wellings.
It was a beautiful goods, and he wanted to hold it the hold.
But that went doesn't do that.
He had no paper -- no piece, no table, no table.
And the amazing exciting exciting exciting exciting the melods, and then it turns out to me the melodd forward.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up, and he looked up, "Sorry heard, you can't see that I behind the she's high?"
"Do you really think I can write a song of song you on a song of song?
And if you really want to get that this song come, you have to get later another one of the time, if I have time.
Now, not, go to somebody else did a difficult fall down.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohently from that moment was writing the process of very different.
The work itself is even the same thing with the familiar underto.
But the heavy of the heavy of the creative process distance, when he distanced the enjoy of the genius.
The genius was to close on the skin and liversion and liversion.
And then the realized that there was no reason to go through through through to go through through through to go through it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizard collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner that was not quite completely was not quite at all.
That story has changed my way of working.
I've been a profitting of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle I was Bif.
At a certainly moment I window in despair.
You know, you know, you don't want to be good work and you can't be a terrible disaster and it is a terrible disaster --
Not just horrible horrible ad.
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was to be a genius, and I decided to a try to way.
I wishing me from my manuscript and I focused to a empty corner of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know all being a both is not just a brilliant is not brilliant to billiant me.
You can see everything I have in the stop I have in the stop I have in it.
I can't give you a lot of this.
If you find that it better can, you have to do you.
Do you don't have that? Do you don't do that, unamber room.
I just write because that's a long my work.
Oh, and in the notules, and in the notte is just a differently, on the office is different."
Tjage -- it's just in this -- it's on down here.
Enview ago, in the North African desert people to get together to dance with monlight to dance in the sacres of sacred music.
Uring and hours and hours and back to the back of the morning.
That was always great because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes very single thought happened to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a real result.
One of those dancers became than transcendent.
You know what I mean what I mean by that, you know, you know, ever see you this, you know, ever see in a performer.
It was like the time she was silenced and the dance, and the dance.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of it, but now everything together.
And all of suddenly he didn't seemed to human being.
In him, under him, under him, above him,
A did fired fired through through fire.
And if something happened to be a such on the stycle, they started to clapping and crossing in cost, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical factor, they basically, the Moren Spange conquenced this narrative.
The quote is real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Oly, oy."
That hort you today the day of the day fights and flamengodance.
As an artist, in Spanist of an artist, or magical does, "Allah, Oh, oy: "Allah, Allah, broad."
Oh, understand see: a glimpse of God.
Pective what we need to do.
Lastig is the dance, the dancing the next morning to the morning was discovered that he discovered on dincluding 11 hours in the morning.
And at that moment he is a little bit more elderling guy with depends that may be never more to such a such of such hights.
Maybe never going to be anyone God anybody God are dance.
What is he still now with the rest of his life right now?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to slow up for a creative spirit for a creative spirity.
But it doesn't need to be that it doesn't have to be that
Imagine not a bit of exciting that the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of your person coming from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have a while of time, a while of a don't nather specificate resource.
When you get ready with them, they are spending to somebody else.
That's what everything is considered everything.
I hang on the average that thought to thought it.
The last months I've been working on a book that in short that will be approached in a lot of reacts. It book a lot of a long time.
The opportunity of that illustrater.
And if my mind with me on the hold of the hold I went on the hold before. Don't be at the today.
Do just your work.
just a lot of your thing, which is what it is.
If you took a dance, you know, dance.
If the divine genius that you is being decide to decision to your work at work at your work at the amazing sources of the amazing, "Ole.
Then not, dance dance it doesn't do that.
And then, "Ole gottoo.
I believe that I believe that heart.
"Olens," anyway, because we pure out of pure human love and wisdom by continuing plught.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole.
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome, and what that can meaning, and what that can meaning, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can meaning, and what that can meaning, and what that meaning, and what that can meaning, and what that can mean to mean
We actually start from a new point of point that we were the digital code to digitize the digital code to a new phase of that digital code to a new phase in biology to go to a new phase life.
So we always tried to ask the great questions.
"What is living a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different levels of different levels of different level.
We tried to get different approach to minimum components.
We're now almost 20 years,
When we have sequenced, the human genome ced, it was from the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask you, can we live to live regenerate, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of that can be multiply in a laboratory laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nonce before we can get a non-genome.
We can put in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there are 500 or so that are there there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simply compared to the metabolical map.
Belebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can probably unlikely that this would be a life cell cell that this would be a life.
We decided that the only route pretty was to ask this chromosome of this chromosome of the components to synthesizing the components to ask the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as we say, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthesize as we started a chromosome synthesize synthesize synthesize synthetic synthetic synthetic sy
Do the chemistry the chemistry great molecules that we never seed?
And, if we do that, can do a chromosome cle?
A chromosome is by the way, by the way, but a piece of chemical inerity.
So, our tempo of the digitizing life is accelerating life is accelerate.
Our power, to write the genetic code, but is a pretty slowly slowly slowly to write the genetic code.
And our last point would be place at this point at this point of exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of course, to start with a bio-ethic correctly before to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that makes little pieces of DNA letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you piece of piece, the more wrong.
So we had to do a new method to put a new method of these little pieces and corrating all the mrong of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attemption, by the digital information of the genome Phi X.
That's a little virus that bacteria died.
We designed the pieces, did the bags --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part when we started a piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria of chemical code, and the bacteria genetic code genetic code and make viral particles went to make and make viral particles --
The viral particles were clear from the cells, they were corned from the cells, they were back back and the E.
I was unning in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model just too good fail --
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where this is a situation where the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so that we could variety of viruses, so that we could call the cassettes --
and understand what the real actually is components of a life cell cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that have to be digital information is very digital information in the computer than
When we first first crazy to the genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard of 10,000 baseparat.
And then finally, we found after resequencing 30 mistakes. And if we had used the original sequence was not in the state sequence of the case of the case of the case of the original sequence.
And the design is the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build about the sub-sub-sub-unch showing together.
We designing here unique unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read to have read water note.
There's a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, C, Gened.
Trios of those letters of code for rule 20 aminose -- that there is a letter-routh cup.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
And then a bit of corned to be a bit of course.
Some of some of the corporation, that there were no poems of poems.
We have designed these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repaired and put them in each other.
And we started piece of pieces that five to start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters of each other, and you have piece of 24,000 letters, take up to 72,000 letters, to 72,000 letters,
And in each stage, we could continue a flot of these pieces so that we could sequence a process because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust --
We try to reach the point of automatization.
So this is a basketball like a basketbal.
And as we come to the really big piece of the really great -- more than 100,000 baseparate basevices -- they don't grow that easy more in E.
That resources the except of all the modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to raisming with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist recombination, that is used by the biology to repairs by the biology to repairs together.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococococococococococcus radio durans to radiodurans to radiod the radiodurans that three million radio radio radio radio radio of radio radio of radio radio radio is called Deinocococococcus radio radio radio ra
And you see that in the upper panel, she just clear clear business simply simply each other.
12 hours later 24 again, he put it back up to each other, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely opened up.
They can be in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space, that can be moving in space, that can be moving forward a new aquatical environment.
NASA has a married of this, there's a lot of of this.
Here's a real microphoto, of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually usual with these processes -- actually yesterday mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did.
Gist makes that they automatically together.
This is not an electronen-microscopphotograph; this is a regular microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we spent recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule, is more than 300 million.
If we might do it with a 10-point letter, without spaces, without spations, then there is 142 pages to pressure the genetic code.
Well, how do we start a chromosome of the chromosome of the activate and do it?
With a virus is a pretty easy easy.
With a bacterium is a lot of complicat.
It's also simpleer if you put under the century of the ekaryots, as you just put the cell cell cell from and doing another in, and that's what you know if the clone.
And the bacteria species of the bacteria of chromosome of the cell in the cell -- but we have a full transplant transplant transplant to a chromosome of a chromosome of the cell to another, and can activate it.
We have a chromosome of the microbs of a microbs of type.
These are about so far from each other as people and mously again, and mously mously moved as people and mous.
We add some extra genes that we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the stuff.
We have the reason enzymes to make all the proteins to make all the proteins of the proteins of the proteints.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here, in the cell -- the new chromosome of the new chromosome --
We even thought he would just come to square that but we tried to develop the process of a little further of being a process of this.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of types have a second chromosome of the third somewhere they have thousands of properties that they have thousands of properties in one times of the kind of the kind of so.
People that evolution evolution evolution is not a lot of biology changes not a lot of biology have been concerned to be a lot of biology change.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that actually found DNA did
The chromosome that was not one.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- well,
It was expressed, and it was recognize the other chromosome of the other chromosome of the chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the cell of chromosome cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell chromosome of the other chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the cell of the cell of chromosome of the cell that we had the cell in the cell in the cell
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappearing all the characteristics of the one species, and changed completely in the new kind, and changed on the new kind, and changed on the new software that we stopped in the cell that we had stopped in the cell of the new kinds of basic buriece.
All of proteins changed the genetic coded -- when we read the genetic coded was changed.
This is a massive as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Good, I've been paying before that this is not a creation -- this is a production -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I pay have pay better that maybe we may be a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of new species that make large dissecurated on this digital design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what you look at what it is needed to look at what it is.
We're going to get into a six-and-half to a billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years, that are going to be four years.
We have a trouble with food, with clean water, medicine, fuels, fuels, fuels, fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel, and a half billion.
That is a difficult to do that for nine corporation.
We use five billion ton coal colls, more than 30 billion did.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in the any single shouldn't be a huge process to replace that -- then that a huge challenge is being a huge challenge.
Then of course there is all that carbon dioxide of the core that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is a carbon in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming of the carbon dioxide of the
And through all our global discoveries have now that we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dozens of components, and look at the diversity that comes out of that.
We're resources by a biological reality and our imagination,
We have now thanks through this fast, fast, combination called "combination genomics."
We have the ability to build a great robot that can make a million chrobot can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put on the work of 20 million different genes, or trying to optimize processes to optimize octan, or drug the medicins, we can produce new vaccins, we can change a small team biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability or fuel, vaccince, vaccinproduction, vaccincluding ence, and so forth.
This is a screen mafine mafine that design software that we work on the computer, so that you can actually go to the account of the computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code out of the genetic code.
We focus on the fourth generation.
One of you have seeing the grain of ethanol you face experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come out of the fuels will come out of the fuels like sugar, as a sugar fuels like octan, or different kinds of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have biology without the food price without the food price of the availability is when we start with CO2 as are food-subject subject that are in that way, and we think that we are doing it in that way, and we think that we are doing the first furnitude generation of fuels of the first fired generation of fuel of food.
Sollight and CO2 is method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea half miles deep, cooking it cool deep, cool cooking him peraturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at if we can take CO2 we can take care of course, what can be drived to be back to factories, where that CO2 is back CO2 back to the fuel, to send this process.
So in a short of time we think we are able to break that we're able to break on the basic question: What is life?"
We actually have a real purpose to have the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, where you can't do this, where you can't do this?
A important energy source becomes
But we also use these are using tools to think about this tools to think quick faithing.
This year was the flu, we walking up the facts of the facts that the facts of facts when it comes on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the combined vaccines of combined vaccines.
Here's how the future can see the future can see that the evolution tree now is going to change the future, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eventually evolution, and eventually evolutioned
We're still away from the improving people.
Our goal is to assure, we make a chance of survive that we make a chance long enough to survive that may be doing that may be doing that may be doing.
What I want to show you a first of a new technology is the fundament of a new technology that we basically basically basically broadling about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment where you local local or on the state of visual data can work on the immense of visual data can work on the distance.
We look at this lots of gigabytes of digital images and can be severely in the room of continue and made it to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images are images or images are images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congres-megapix.
It all doesn't matter because the only thing because the only thing would influence to influence on a such of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is a gray of home by Dickens. Every colutter.
To prove that it's actually a text real text is actually a picture, we can do something like this, to show that this is really text imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit weird way to read a book way to read a book way to read a book way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't attack.
This is a realistically example. This is a example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part of the under.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real papers of a magazine, which is actually a scale medium.
We also did something with the corner of the excaves of the Guardian.
We have a netter a neton of advertising higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra normal advertising information -- and we have extra information information -- and we have extra near resolution -- and we have extra normade of advertisising a normade of advertisising a norma
If you want to see the possibilities of these car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can actually do the limitations of actions of across the screen of actives.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaures -- not will be necessary -- not will be more now to be more now to be never be.
Of course is a country to the hand map up for a technology like this, I will spend up here at a technology like this, I will spend a time to be a lot of time, except that we can also much a field of contribute this field also much of this, I will continue to a technology as well.
These are all the road in the U.S.
And put on the top, on the image of the NASA --
Let's look at something else to look at anything.
This is a by the way, by the way, you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques of connected.
One is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision of Washington, promoting a Noah Snavely, promoting on the University of Washington, conference.
and Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-deeply resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been broadling these images to be considered with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes. So you see elements of stabilized diashws or panorama and panorama and panorama and all these things are spaced.
I don't know sure or another time there, other environments.
There are much more space that are much more space.
I want to like to do one of the Noah's original data sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth synth that we work in this summer -- to the communicate is the communicate of the communics of the real force of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to do the advoces and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Day, with images of Flickr. You search Dame on in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such every much of thing.
And each of these orange chains gives a picture that part of this model of the model of this model of model in this model of model being part of this model in the piece of the piece of the piece of charge.
And so all of Flickr images, which are all of this way that are in this way of space that are crazy.
And we can get a simple indicate.
You know, I never thought I would have thought I would ever work at Microsoft I would ever work.
It's overwhelming here is so much of this.
I believe you can see that these are typice type of cameras are cameras of good reflex, a big number of them, summed in this environment.
I'll try to figure out some weird images.
There are so much covered by faces and such everybody like this.
Anywhere between is even a series of photographs -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also good accurrently by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do is do we really can do things with the social environment. This uses now the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of how everybody -- and headlands -- and headlands that everything about each other.
All these photographs are being a bunch of a little bit larger than the parts.
You have a model that from from the whole Earth,
That as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work work on Stephen Lawler's work on the Stephen Lawler's work on the room of work Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to use it and also the benefits grow for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are before that somebody else data that somebody else that somebody else
If somebody would want to attack all these saccountry and their names, and their names, my photographs, and it is a bunch of the Ntre Dame up with all that data, and I can use that metaph, that metaphor, used to be used to be access anyone of these cross-modal, and creating a kind of cross-modal, and creating social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social of all of all of all of all of these of these of thing.
And of course, is the by-product place of this immense rich virtually model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from air photographs, satellites and other applies, and other applies, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible in the next years, all the images that are ded by everybody on the world can show everybody on the world can get corner world together?
BA: Yes. What this really does discover.
It creates a wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it doesn't does that on the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the richness of semantic information that is a lot of these images a lot of images.
When you look for the web looks for images, you can see a querce, and the text on the web page of the webpage of what the image is a lot of information about what the image is the image of the image of the image of image.
What is that image of image is to have your image of imagination?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that continue of that comes out of that comes from the classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's actually incredible. Gefelicity.
One of the intense native and of eating eat, is the possibility to live between they're not forget to life between them, who are not forget to forget their past, who are still feel in the wind, the profitterest of polishing rise in the wind, the profitter.

If you think about it, this idea can only give you a hope of this.
And these are the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and cultural life is as important as the biological life.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a eat.

No biologist would take a biologist that at least half of all kinds of extinction extinction is not true.
And that is the most apocalyptical scenario not even in the neighborhood comes in the neighborhood scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this.
And then everybody here was born here was born sixts, there were sixth thousand languages on Earthousand talk about the world.
A language is more than her words, or her grammatic rules.
A language is a flight of human soul.
It's the view of the value that the soul of every unique culture the material world reach.
Every language is a century of mind spiritation, a distinction, a thought, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
And from that sixth thousand languages today is not fluisted in the day of that didn't fluisted in children's early fluisted in the day of that side today is flistening languages today is flistening today of that sixtly half today is fluisted in the day half of languages today that is not a bunch of

Or Kogi." You will realize you just realize how it would not be able to speak your own language.
So what I really want to do today is taking you on a short journey by the eat, which has to be a picture of what is in fact, in fact, which is a picture of what is in fact,

I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests forests to be capital.
And that made me a different humans from the Kwagh, who believe that those forests believe that those forests forests the lives of Kuxwhuxx, and the Kromme Snavel and the Kroms and the cannibal minds that are in the north world.
These mind are important during their Hamatsa-invision.

If you take the plant -- it seems to be a blue rookwalm by your consciousness whales.
The plant is mixed with leaves of a coffee being a coffee beyond of a coffee of four dies.
The plant tryptacks, powerful tryptamines, because of brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they snow that snow that snow of different kinds of methoxyltryltryltryptamine contain?
That poother your nose is being a become shots, become shots, couraged with barokages on a sea of electricity. This is not a disturbing of the reality. This is not a distortion of the reality.
I was tried to my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince the psychedelic age-discovered age-found in Mexico in the 1930s.
I painted that these tryptamines didn't identify as hallucinating, because when the effect his in, because when the effect his infect is to experience the hallucination. Tryptamines are not oral, because they are not oral, oral in the human beings are not oral, in the human daround in the human darmouth of canner: monoy oxida.
They can be only oral oral with something that the monoamine of the samine of samine of them.
The fascinating is that the bettable carbolines in the lide of the beno-called monoamine-unpressurs are to activate the tryptamine of the tryptable.

The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to remind the war or technology are going to be in the war technology innovations, but earlier as the age, and active particips or passive looking at the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity on the planet.

Or if we go to the Tibetter to the Tibetter where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical exception of a population is convalence, but eventable, the destruction of life is not just invitated not only not just caused but is not just in a lot of resources of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not too containing to the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I think about a young colleague about a young colleague about country of China to Lhasa.
And when I was in Lhasa was in Lhasa was understood the statistics that you heard about the statistics that you heard about it.
6,000 Hay monuments destroyed 1.2 million people died in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And in that based was killed to the Chinese invasion started.
His unless the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people in Nepal broadling the people in Nepal broadling the people in Nepal broadl.
His mother was showed because she was wealth.
He was cased the prison that he was clearned when he was two -- and he was hidden under her rock to her room and she clearned without and he clearned without of the case was broke and he clearned the prison her room when he was two and he was clearned in her room, and he was clearned to be able to be able to clearned in her room and clearly.

The great anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she was terrificians that we direction, the world picture.
We wouldn't just see the human imagination become a smal, modal cor, and forget forgotten to be a smal, but we would have been agreed that there are other opies.

The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history shoot history didn't give me the idea that we have all the answers of all the question of all the question of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to be asked to answer the meaning of humans are being a 10,000 different voices.
And it is that we will discover again, we will discover to be the possibility to be what we are, a folbest species, which are all the things to flow all the gardens and can flower. There are greats great.
This photograph I was on the northern of Baffin Island taken up when I went on narrowed on narway.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been reendly for the Internation, in the 1950s, they were to reach our sources to reach our souldn't have been put in the 1950s.
The opa of Olayuk.
The family weapons for his life and dishead him already weapons for his tools.
Now you have to understand that the Insion of the coll, they used to use it.
The gline became the gline were originally made the slightly of fish in cararible of fish.
Olayuks opera was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that wouldn't be the storm that wouldn't wonder.
He went out, he was outside of sea hundred skin his hand. And then he put the poop started to freezing, shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a low-ly-egger to the side of the mess.
When it solid, he was slaught on it.
He did the dog and improvised a harnas.
And from the ribbast, he made a sleet.
He looked like dogs in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice fooped pools.
Over with nothing around coming around with nothing that is in many way, many concerned for the weather of the Interrations of the Indical people.
In april 199, the Canadian government of the Inside of the entire being the entire country greater than California and Texas it called California and Texcited Nunavut.
It's independent. They are region all the resources.
It's a amazing example of how a national national reason her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clear to the entire to this is at least for who is requently, that she didn't really far, that she didn't really get away away away away away from the world is not away away away away to this is not far away to these up.
They are somebody else country.
They are before of the human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, just as that of the one, part of the unclean, part of the hope.
What we ended up to National Geographic, is going to be extension of the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that a pick -- we think that a piece is not convince, but we think that stories is transform that stories can change the world, which is probably the best changes the world, is that we probably the best 35 million times a month of a month of month of a month of millions of publics a millions of public.
We make a lot of resources to the eat, with our public cultural places, to be indical cultural places, where the true is so interested by what he sees hopefully what he sees hopefully the main opening opening of the anthropology will go into various in different plurary and find a way to live in a multure, that we can find a way to live in a multure and pluralistic world and live in a multuralist of pluralist of pluralistic world in a pluralistic world and we can do we can fulture,
where all the wisdom can contribute to us all the wisdom of all the well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some some some question I think that recently recently decided that I decided to a book
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I try to explain some ways that may be missing anything that has been mistance.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To become exactly to be, the official dogma of all the westersis, industrialized society.
And that official doggma as follows follows to get the wonderful of our citizens on the highest level, we need to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a great deal, a essential part of the human exist.
And then then freedom that is able to act us to act across according to act a higher prosperate, to reach a higher prosperate without of this.
The ultimate freedom we find choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means automatically more prosperity.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would take a driving on the moment would take a driving driving on the society.
And in our life is corned by the way, this dogma failed crossed by the way.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A high high high of this.
OK, I think about dressings.
And next 175 can-ended virginary dressings are in my supermarket, in my supermarket, extra-virgin olic oil and different balsamics and different balso.
And you can do that the number of the number of the dressings that are 175 species of you don't have anything that is nothing about it.
So that's the appropriate of my supermarket.
Look at electronicastore to electronicastoring your stereoset of stroneoset of your stereoset game, cassetttespul, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio,
And you can pick up the one electronicawin, you can pick out of this pattle.
You can see a six-and-half million different systems with subjects, with subjects, with subjects.
Give to -- you have a lot of time.
Anyway, again, a different example --
When I was young ago, you could take all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't wrently the state. You don't never it.
That had a consider that the advantage of that is never going to be a piece of this.
That time is a pretty time.
Today are a lot of different state.
And before to cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the means -- that with mid-3--player, nose and crer and crer and crer crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer and crer crer
Well has not seen this model in the store, but you can see that that that happens short.
And the consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer to the answer question of the answer question to the answer question to the answer question that question that question that question is the answer to the answer question that question that question that question that question that question of the answer question of that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the point of stuff, is a lot of stuff, is this explosive of choices are a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so that you go to the doctor, and you can do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and saying, "We can do it, or we can do it.
A has this front of this form and tools.
And what do you want to do?" What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doh, what does you say, "Do you say, "Doh, what does you say, "Doctter, what does do you say, "Doctter, what do you think you say, "Doctter, what does you say, "Doctter, what does do you think you say, "Doctter, what does you says, "Doh, what does do you think about that?"
And the doctors says, "As has this front of the piece, and docughtly doctor.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctter, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctors says, "But I'm not you."
And then we call that "inbringing the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means that the heavy task of decision of decision of the core -- the doctor, to a seemed from the doctor, somebody who are certainly decisions -- the patient. For condition to take the best condition to recept the patient.
Good considered that nerday, because the purpose group, because the purpose group, you can't buy it.
Why do do we make advertising, if we can't buy it?
Because they think we go to the next morning, our doctor to ask our doctors to ask that other brank doctors to ask that other brank doctors of the other brank is drug to the next morning.
Our identity, yet a design aspect of us existence, is now considered to choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity is to solve our background.
We find ourselves from -- so much we want to do it.
Every every one morning, you have to think of what you want to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that that every single everybody else that was going to be so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible as possible everybody else as quickly as quic
The only real choice was not when and what you did and what you did did do.
Now, does freedom, everything for the opportunity.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, which I developed less house than the wonderful of the result of the result.
They are not dommber or line or line of time.
No, they have drop the pressure with choices.
"Well, I say, or not? Well, I now?
Or I will wait for that? Well, first of a career?" I first am or a career?"
These are all being questions.
They are going to have an answer to answer them, as this means that they don't get all their homework and therefore not a good number of corrects.
And they're right. It's important life.
And then we come to work. Carl gave that technology is already to work. Carl gave every minute of every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a fairly place, which I like WiFi the does.
I don't run that because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice freedom choice in that we wonder whether we go on time, or nower time, or now.
We can look at a football of our sone, with our son, with our sone, with our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all out of standing out of standing every minute of that competition of the conceptible questions, "Well, I answer this phone curious question?
Well, if you write this email responsible writ?"
And even if the answer answer is "Ne," we experience the football of our son a very different way.
What we look at all of it, the great, the small, materialist bags, lifestyle, lifestyle.
And so the world early early looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, if this good or bad or bad of bad or bad --
And the answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about is bad about what is bad about is bad about is bad of bad about what is bad about is bad of a bad of this.
That huge choice has two effects, two negative effects on human.
A very opposition is that it before it before that it is paralyzed than liberately before.
With so much choices people find it difficult to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of this, a research for investments in voluntary pensions.
A colleaguard of me corporate data of me corporate data of policy data of policy degree involved about one million employees of spread ded about 2,000 fight?
She discovered that for every decades that work the work of worker being the patters of the participath two percent nam.
And in fift-fundred tend to decade a lunder of five fundress than fundresh of fundres?
Because it with fifthrough funds so difficult to choose that people just extend to the next day, and that people are just going to the next day, and so on.
And from expensive comes from the way.
That means not only that those people after their pensioner after their pensioned because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money underneat, but also the choice knowledge was so difficult to have let me shoot history.
And that left to that 5,000 dollars a year on their nose before to go on their nose before to go on their nose.
The worker was prepared to double, to double.
So a lot of choice can work together.
And I think the world of the world through that looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make a very lot to make the right time, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. It is the second effect is also if we had the paralyzed and eventually left less teeth, eventually less teves the result of the result than the case, if we had less options less options if we had less options of less options as we had less options of the lamine of the paralyzed effect of us as we
There are multiple of reasons for that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, from number dressings, back that the choice was not perfect.
You imagine that was a different for that another choice would have better better better would be better
This was dreamed alternative alternative that you get speak of your choice.
And does broke on the entertainly of the choice that you have made that you have made it a good choice.
So more options there are more option, the easier to have a spired of the picture, which is option.
Second reason of doing with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert from hurt from morning, we have the value of things that we get the value of things that we equivalue to compare them.
If you can inand you can think of many alternatives, you can see the attractive cants of all the alternatives that you destence.
That makes you less tevthrough the alternative that you crazy.
One example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This pick is on vaquatic in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second of the wound.
They are beautiful beautiful beach. Stralend again.
Don't be able to do it? "Fordik," thinks that man, "It's augents.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I could put my car for the door, I could parker."
And he is simmy, two weeks to simmy, with the idea that he went to be a great misunderstanding place.
Substitutic costs are going to be costs of our choice that we have of our choice that we have a great choice.
How more possibilities, the more attractive alternatives are more possible alternatives.
And that presenting us as substitution to us as substitution cost.
One of an example.
This picture is a number of points.
Like in here, and now for example, and now you have to hit down to consistance.
And one point is that you have every choices.
And all that other has been so much of the other has been countries, which is becoming less attractive is being less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this through my question of my question of a new broek.
I always speak always brow.
Because it was only one kind of speed browdit; and it was bought you and it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you did the broek long enough and often crazy and often enough the broad of the room OK.
And after years, I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That I want to say, "That's my makes broek, this is my make.
And the real said, "Well, you fit fit easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know or a rhyth? Do you know stood wedd?
Do you want a broken with shed substance?
Do you know something except pipes, or flink walking together." And so he went down." And so he went down.
I was spire of a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want the only browd."
He had no idea what broke that was and so I had a long long all the possible brows of all the possible brows of all the possible brow.
And I think it's honestly honestly ended up with a bit of fairly with a brown.
I did better do. I had better to do it better it.
But I don't feel better this.
Why? To explain to me, I wrote a book -- I wrote a book
The reason I don't feel better freedom, was that I started to expect more of the same brown.
I started without expectation, because I just know one kind of speak known.
And then turned out there were different and then one of that would be different there,
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I mean, I was expecting my broed, and that picked me television to me
How more possibilities, people have more expectations of the requires of that possibilities.
And that means people are less tevile with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
And in really about it.
Everything was better when everything was better --
Because everything was doing was a pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society as a wonderful societs, but the best thing we can reach perfection, but the best thing we can reach is so good as we had expected as good as we had been expected as well.
Never become involved to be surprise, because our expectations, my expectation, are town.
The secret of happiness -- you all of the number -- the secret of happiness is not too much to expect too much of happiness --
I want to ask here -- I want to be a car, a car biographic elemental -- that I am with a woman who really fantastic is.
I don't have me with her showed me with her less teves.
But with less enough are good sides of the good sides.
And finally, you know, when you bad a bad bad bad of being a bad bad bad of buying a bad forhands of front of why you wonder, you can wonderful your inteves.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible -- you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brows are available to fall out a hundred out to fall to fall that is responsible than responsible responsible of different breaks, and you buy a highly hundreds of different brows being available to fall hundreds of different browdit?
The answer is just simple. That are you.
You know, a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows you don't have excuse the excus.
So as people decisions, even if people decisions, they are picked in the results of those decision-fools about their choice.
And they take themselves are really.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations are high-time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor at this explosion of depression and self-my-moder, is that people have so much television of the experiences because of the high experiences.
And if they try to explain that teleuration for itself, they try to explain, they give itself.
So the ntoresulate is that we have objective that we spoken on the objective of it.
One of a society.
This is the official dogma, that is being taken everybody for everybody to be taken on the top.
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't seem to choose better than can't choose better than it can't do automatically that automatically is better better is better better is better another choically better is better than it is not automatically better than automatically that is not automatically choically, but from that is not follow
There's a magical borders of choices abilities. Well, I don't know.
But I know that we're already before we have been pretty before us wwell.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best thing that we can do to be the best of the best thing that we can do to be the best of the best thing that is ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best thing to be best to be the best thing to be best of the best thing that is ready best ready
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overfluning from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem is not too much of a lot of choice is not too much choice.
So the paradox I talk to the core of the paradox I have a modern, wonderful West.
That's frustrating and all this: Steve Levitt has been told that expensive that expensive and did to installing kids don't help help kids. Solar of your money.
I say the same thing about this pige, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help out. Erger now.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of what people are in our society of the choices of countries to have been put together to have a little bit of the people have been forward on it.
And our life would be living on the forward of it.
That's what economists called a Pareto-in-increment.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have been coming to our community that we put to our community of the last of that we put to our community of the last of people -- and everybody -- and everybody is better
And finally, this. If you read this image story, you're reading this picture, humans say, "Ah, what does you know about it?
Nothing is possible in a fishing sense."
A cortative imagination, a short-high global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I understood that this fish, I understood that this fish.
Because in fact, there's a lot of fish: If you put the fishing capital, you don't have freedom, but paralyzing.
If you put the fish to create possibilities, you get less textist your less textaphology.
It lead to more paralyzing and less teving.
Everybody needs a fishing sense.
This is a virtually certainly -- it even for the fish, but even for us.
But the absence of a figured fish to ask is asking for wonderful to ask to window forward, inheily.
Thank you for your attention.
