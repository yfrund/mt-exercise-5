And I showed this two dia's showing these two dia's pollist the polar cap, which is three million years of the vastance of the vastance of the US, with 40 percent currently of the U.S.
But this is actually the requires of this specific problem because it didn't show.
The ice capach is on the North Pole, in a sentence, heart of our global climate system.
It is looking at the winter and crack in the summer.
The next dia that I show is a dia I show is happened in 25 years is happened to 25 years is happened to 25 years is happened to be 25 years is happened to be 25 years is happened to be a fasticture.
The permanent ice is disdure.
As you see, it looks at dark blued.
That's the year, which is the evilious ice during the winter.
And it critical in summer.
It was so called ice, five years or five years or parently as blood, that is almost like blood, that from the body, here.
In 25 years is the way of this is going.
And that's a problem because the frozen freors around the North IJszee sea and there's a very large amount of fail frozen carbon free dom, when it finds methane, when it is designed by microbed in methane.
And, ready closed the total, in the atmosphere, that would be doubited to doubits point if we can double the currently describe describe describe describe describe describe describe describe to describe in the atmosphere, that may describe in the atmosphere.
In one of some until mate in Alaska borrelt methane on the water.
Professor Katey Walter Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another uneer undeep me.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is realize we are going to be better.
A reason that is that this huge warmbron" Greenland of the normous warming.
This is a smeltwated so.
The water than ever before is bigger than ever beyond be.
This is the Kangerlussuagest-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea cure of the sea because it countries, is the place where it is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea.
These stroms are taking away to be doing this.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole on the southern mass the largest ice massive mass on Earth.
At the months of the scientists scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly, very quickly, with named a few underwaters to the same pure of the South police of the South police of the South police of the South police is very quicklands.
The whole continent is increating for six meter, just as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice massa, there are new now, that are new now, that are new now, that are new now, that were a few years ago.
There is 40 percent of the world's population is getting water of that smell water of that smelers.
In the Andes, this glass is this gler for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also dressed the drinking water.
In California reduce of 40 percent in the snow.
It's really comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reading the predictions are nstigation.
This worldwired dreams has led to a dramatic styce.
And the number of natural around the world, with an incredible and never see, incredible and never seen fastance.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the progress.
This pattern is completely incredible instance.
If you look at the pursue of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tton CO2 to CO2 24 hours --
25 miles any day, every day, in our oceans, Kean area of the Stille area of the Stille Ocean, from America, west, and every single of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drawer of oxygen in the oceans.
The only major causing the Earth, is designed in the Earth, which is the 20 percent money, is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and benefull, and it's all the largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest of the two largest extincluding China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more more cition central central central of building central of together.
But we see a counter.
These are the benefits of which is the building was annuled in the last years, and where green alternatives and where green alternatives were proposed in the last years.
There's a political stributed to the gang in our country.
The steences and oil industrial industry 250 million dollars to promote a single carbon dollars to promote a cure cool --
That image to something that think about something that is thinking about something that I think that imagine.
Rond the current, at me, at me in Tennesse, about four billion liters of course model.
You probably have seen the news face.
This is the one-biggest depended in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertise of the advertised the Kerstrive was thing.
Video: "Frosty the currently guy is a break guy is a bit of number of number of course.
He is overfluence, and he is going to be in America, and he shows that our economy.
Frosty the country to the day,
He is pay and wonderful and curattack their bances their bance."
Here is a big comes a big part of the currently in West Virginia --
The biggest mine work is the great country is the great Massey Coal.
Video: Do Blankship -- "Let me be Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Don't be Gore, Don't know where they talk about where they have the about they're talking about where they have the about they're talking about what they talk about that."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantially behavior to reclassion to the light of the truth and the reproduces of the truth of value in the truth of value of the truth of value in the truth of value is why the most import
Feit is, suppose is not sick.
We think it's a slight -- and it's still leaking it --
So, you don't make a care about care about care change.
Let me just say that we are over.
Video: Acteur: Schone-carbon that you heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern cities of course countral.
Fantastic! The machines making what lawyer is what lawyers.
But that's the sound of sound sound of sound sound technology.
And thanks the fact that it burning burning one of the most important cause of the Earth, changes of the Earth, changes the remarkable of the Earth, changes that you see all of this.
Look around the wood around, this is the scene technology of today.
Al Gore: Eintually purpositive alternative alternative alternative to our economic security.
Video: America reflect in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red review is our dependence, our dependency of fossil fuels, as fiile columnited oil.
But now is a during during new solution to this.
For 100 percent of 100 percent schone electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America work to get a security and the opportune of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth is curity.
Eintually a solution that is realizing enenough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontook hold America.
Al Gore: And the last thing.
Video: It's going to give America is to give America to give energy.
One of the fastest ways to make an end on our dependence of old fuel, view of old fuels that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then 2: New investmental tract good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tian,
Al Gore: There is an old African speak that says, "If you want to be well.
If you want to go to go, gone together."
We need to go and far ast.
Thank you very much.
And I gave a year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hicle to get hicle to how that works.
So here I am this. For those who were not going to be the largest scientific experiment is ever understanding understanding in the grandometers in ometer.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion than a billion times a billion times a second second second second.
Enorm ambitions, right!
This is the machine.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs bread, 22, and this is the one that I work. It's the one I work. It is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
And at 10 september shape year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was genomes by ATLAS.
That made a party party for a party party room.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the LHC garound the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, which is faround the LHC, which is where particles in the detector.
With other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September knew that the machine works, which is a huge overwhich, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the largest biggest the largest of the biggest and saw the Internet page, and that the Internetpage.
That means we made a cultural as a science of science impact impact is made a scientific impact that means made a science of cultural impact as a science of the science of that means are made a science of the science that means are made a scientific impact that means are made a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make a problem with these gold gold to these gold gold to these gold gold.
That draws 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers are saying, "Not that are to say, "Not that are too small the small bed."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superature in all the lage temperature temperature to be superature in all the lage of temperature are very low-lying around in all the low-low-long charge of the lage of temperature are superature to do that they are superature superature superature are superature them.
So on min 271 degree between the space between the gs, that can read behaviors that stream read that stream read between the girl.
In one of the nets between nets between nets in the LHC, sat the LHC, sat the LHC, sat the LHC, sat a constructive.
And that was the wirelectrically there was something warmer, and there was a thousand amper of thousand amper resources.
This was the result.
This is another inpresent when you realized that that magnets more than 20 tons that are more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeter than 20 centimeter than 20 centimeter in the timeter of the increates.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it.
We all have them to get them to tool.
Now they are back to again.
Eind might be the LHC is going to be intact.
We will put it again, and we expect measure, so that we can go into you.
Now, of course, who are incredibate the debate of the debate of science the value of science research.
I think it's so hard to be hard to be a few that we go beyond beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I showed the last words on the English science Humphrey Davy, disin, I did the defently defic, during the defently of his learning, his learning, his learning, this is so dangerous experiments of the human being than the human being than the human being than the images that we have not been a mysterious that we are not completely to be in nature, and that we are completely completely that we are completely that we discover.
Thank you very much.
And I would want to start with you to get back to your kids to your kiddle to your kids when you play with blocks.
Then you discovered how to understand how to move to understand and and consciously problems to learn with the declasses of space relationships.
Rumultiply is strong-insight is strong-true insight.
If a information, inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advision -- sample of my advisi, Jeee Kalanithi -- what if we used a computer -- what if we used a computer -- what if we used a computer music finger as a kind of continue that information to a movingera to a reautype bread, what information with a bread, we can fignore borrows in a breastand,
And then we can do this?
This question is that we decided to see, that we decided to see, by the building of Siftables.
Something is a core of an interactive computer terter-bigge.
They can be able to the hand and they can be able to do another, their movement and their movement detect and they came up and wirely them contact.
The nuclear is the physical hands of the barness, as they can be placed by understand through it is to understand
And so Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
That cause these helps are a more physical different of physical differences of their movement and even of the way we have been movement, and even of the way we have sweek, there are different new and like, there are different new and like, there are different new and soil interactions
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is institude, to show a video showing and others that plays, and others plays, and others plays.
These interactive portraits are awareness of each other.
Indience, they will interested each other for each other for each other other interests.
And if they get up to become up, they can be able to be what they can be certainly become a little bit of them.
There are feeling and they movement and helling.
We realized algaum that one of the interesting of the interesting of this interaction, the using of all the interaction, as it is a color of a color was a smer of a color as it was a fluid foot as it was a fluid flower as it was a fluid of interaction, as it was a foot of interaction, as the one of the interaction of the interaction, as the realiz
In this example three Siftables of Siftables for and I can use them to go into a leg, where they are moved in a leg, where they are become human being becomes in.
And if we have three we government, we went back.
There are some possibilities for education, mathematics are plays, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility that we want to give things like to fast.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci resulty reprogrammmatic results.
Here we show you show you a game between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a letter leave, and further classed in a dictional words.
And after about 30 seconds it is about 30 seconds it is very single of the next of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am them to make it out of it and make it out of making it out out a single of making and make a video of making and making a video of it.
They were actually realize it.
And one of the most interesting things of these pack things of these pack is that people almost not needs.
Everything you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they need to do.
These are some other people to the test.
That's our youngst benefits tribution.
And seems that he just like the Siftables that wouldn't be stacking.
For him were just blocks.
Here is an interactive paintings a interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demous degree.
He can new characters in the scene of the scene of the Sift-fiable to set the Siftable of the table.
Here he shows the sun come.
Video: The Sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good though! Yeah! Yeah!
And by shaives of Siftables and the next of Siftables and the characters of reach other -- Video: Weh.
DM: And so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decided how it decided to decided to decided to decide how it decision.
Video: The cates flying air.
DM: The last example I will show today, Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, where we developed to developed a sound product as the lead, where the lead, and bass and the lead, bass and the drum and the drum and drum the lead,
Eengineering four different variations where you can choose what you want to do you to choose you want to use it.
These happened in leave Siftables are injected injected so that you can detern the pattern of the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a legal Sift-fill effects that are live control,
They're going to be addressed to sound and attack by can.
And before the algets of alway, and completely that are patterned on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: We're starting with a leaving placed in two Siftables, to a first pattern in two Siftables, to a lead.
Now, I think the base I place the base line --
Video: DM: Now I feel what slaggwork to it.
Video: And now I can put the filter to the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can affect live infect live in the effect of live to the filter of live to the filter of the drums of live live to the filter on the drums, so that I can infect the decided.
Video: DM: I can accelerated by the obvious office.
Video: Well, DM: Now I cape the filter to the base for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repeattered it patterned as the plays.
So I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, it become very longer and shorter corter as I want.
With end the declassing of the engineering Sift-basically showing to left Siftly to left Siftly the dimmms of the volume that are very single of the entire through the engineer.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make my passion of new people, which are stemed to be better interfaces that are stemed in the way our brain and lightly work.
And today, I had the time to do you one new element in this design area with some possibilities with some possibilities that we developed in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just a whole new generation is just a whole new generation to the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world.
Thank you very much.
I'm looking at you look at all and talk to you to talk to you to all and talk to you to all and you go to you with you all and I look at you to all and I look at it.
I'm write write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long life and I don't think that ever will change and I don't think that ever change.
And yet there is understand something actually happened in my life and career, and I career with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and see
It started a book that I was understood until I did understanding until my first work in the opposed to my first work on my first work on the world and an international state.
The result is that people are always in and always to always as as I was called me as as as I was called me as as as I was always doing in the ways of the cooms.
Well, what what -- do?
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you that you can ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever even?
Don't you stick you're going to read your entire life write write but never explains where people are going to be able to walk in the people that will be living be?
Don't you think that any there?"
Ery government, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very be. But I remember 20 years ago, I was remember 20 years ago, when I was told that I wanted to be a teenam I wanted to be a teenad.
People said, "Ben you don't never get that you never success success is going to get success success is going to get never going to get never success?
Don't you know, you know, for depended for it.
Don't you bang that you live to this work without that there ever does something from being and that you will be able to dependent on your broken on your broken with your bitters of fail?"
There is one in that streaking.
In the short comes to my answer, my answer, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are being being familiar becomes to be called famil.
All of the time.
But I also am for a lot of other things that is all that you want to know that all of it.
For sea sea sea seage of seage.
But what makes write I ask myself the last time that are coming frommyself where that comes feet.
Is it rational?
Is it logically that someone eight be able to be a bang for the work for the work for the work for their human on Earth are show?
What is so basically creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the effects of the mindnessed in the world.
And then you take my dad was a skull, and I can't remember that there was ever remember in the 40 years that he was ever ased in the 40 years that he was not bang for that.
So this is what it said, "You're the regular block?"
No, it was not about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been reputation by the centuries, also a bit of manical depressive alcoholists.
Schright, that have been reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people are reputation human beings are instability.
Look at the grims doorn, the most most magnificantly creative mind the most magnificant century.
Mayers are young, often by own own own down.
And even those of those who don't even have a self-moorn placeas, under their gave good to be concerned to be able to sweeks.
In the last interview for his death said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of myself in the last interview in the last interview for it."
That's very very true what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of looking at species, we don't look at it.
We all heard it before before and they have heard it with the same thing.
The same thought is that creativity is that creativity is involutive is that a connected to connective and that an artist,
So that's why do I want to talk to today, you can you have to live with that idea of life?
Do you know that OK?
I think I think I think of them about that, I think about it all the way I think of it is that I thought it is not a pretty thought I think,
I think it is the reason I think of the reason I think
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century that this century.
We can creative spors a lot better to live better live.
I know it for me, I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, are dangerous dangerous life.
Sup, the fase where my career, in my career.
Yeah, I'm still young, amper to young,
I can maybe I can make four decade through decade through decade.
And that is probably going to be anything that I think is going to get all the world as the world that is just seen as the world that is just successful book.
We're here with friends on the other, so I can class: high-probably lightly lightly behind me.
Jig, what a little idea !
If you think about that, you're thinking for you knows the morning to the morning to the next in the morning for the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work where I love with the work that I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work that I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work of where I love with the work where I love with love with
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after long after long to the conclusion when I can just go through a psychological protect in the process.
I have to create a safe distance between myself between myself and my over, and my overwhole for the reactions for the reactions of the reactions in my futures.
I have the last year to ways in ways to ways that to do that.
I'm doing in the history and have been doing me deep in other civilizations to see if others have found to see a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative process.
My search, I was browing me to the old Greeks and Romins.
Leop, because it's a long and involved story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was not creativity of themselves.
And Mand believed that creativity was a good particular spirit was a real, unknows that was a lot of reason of human reason and unknow.
The Greeks now called these tremendous of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demoon that he had a demand that influenced that influence.
The Romeins had a kind of right idea.
And they were to they're called a called creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their polician was a geniusion of magins that are operating in the atelling of the ateller of the artist.
A bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the artist, the geniusion to the genius.
And he gave shape to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the earlier that I had the before the earlier results of your work.
Everybody knew that in his work in his work in his work.
The artists was so in protection to protection to a lot of narcism.
If you work bread, you know, you came out there.
Everybody knew that is an invisible geniusible genius.
Well, you know, you work doesn't just read that doesn't just read to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty unity.
Long time is that had been creativited in the Wests creativity was being the Wests creativity was being the Wests creativity was the Wests creativity was being the Wests creativity was became the Wests creativity was became the Wests that was dected.
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed
There is fold a whole new idea -- the individual human beings is the tools of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacking of the goddners of the goddners of the goddary world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believy, creativity came out of individual.
And for the first time in history was about artists became a genius, and they were not that they were a geniused to be a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big faile.
To one person, one person, one person, one person, one individual, that he or she safe that he is the field of the eware earlier, the bron mystery, of everything good -- creative and the known force of everything that is to a lot of responsibility for a fragial human psyche.
And, you know, somebody ask the sun in slightly smooth.
Ego's become blowing to gigantic proportions and there's incredible high expectations of prestations of prestations
And I think this drug the last 500 years a lot of artists capot.
If that is, and I think is that is that I think is the question: "What now do we now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on an olders understand the creative mysterious human beings and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years wouldn't make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the same plays.
Probably seat, in the audience people who are realized in the audience of the idea that equal fight-field pentire pure pends on the work of artists to inspirators to inspirators to inspirate.
It doesn't seems to me you all that I will get you get to you.
And I ask it to me it it.
Why not?
Why would we do not next that thought that thought?
It's just as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the total makes that decided that decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have to create something that has trying to create -- so in fact, so in fact, the creative process -- you know, that creative process is not always rational behave.
That sometimes the sometimes paranormally paranormally remove.
I've been understood until American disinctive.
She is did in the next of the negentic writing they're closed.
She told me about her jeuginia.
Sometime, if they were on the work, she felt she was a close of close she was close to the country.
It was so said so, as if there was a big wave air, as as well.
Some poem golf than the country to her it.
She felt that the flu under her feet her foot and that makes her on that point to do is just one thing to do is doing for her life.
They running home back by the poem and she had to see as quickly as possible and paper prike.
When the close was close to her her her waves that her only chance to write it on the same thing to write it on the same to writer and write her and the her of her her and that was her only her only her entered her to writer and writer to writ.
Sometimes she was not fast enough.
Then rings and running them, but now it doesn't reach the house.
And the close of moments school, it was close to her -- in the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And they were also going to be a bit -- this is what I think that they were beautiful part of the story -- that they are almost mistake.
Then they look at at the house and paper and piece of piece, and school.
Juist on that moment, she had a potoment.
And with her other hand, so told me she was so told it from the air.
They picked it to his start, and then it poem it back in her body, as she wrote the again, as she wrote the again.
In those came out of that came in that set in soccurred in piety, but then in the close.
When I heard that heard -- what I thought, I thought, my creative process.
So my creative process, I don't have anyth! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a music, who are anyone day, who are on the same time, and sweet up and flower, sweet and swer down and trans trans that is going to be a state.
But even in that day, I have had a quarterial experience.
You can also know the myself that are creative ideas in that creative ideas in your break of a source that you can impossible you can identified that you can identificate impossible to you.
What is that sources?
How can we use the without that we are become a without that we are be?
One one way that are good for us to us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musicians musician.
A few years ago, I interview him for a magazine.
We had the thought it about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is living the showed of the amazing artists that are all power to get all the power to get in the uncontent of the uncontinue creative impulse in him that are increative impulse in him in him that are expended in him in the unconcertained that is trying to get in the unbasically
With the 1990s was a little bit roost.
And one day, he read in Los Angeles Angeles Angeles and changed the process.
And as he was there so real, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided that inspiration that is that inspiration that faile, understand that close corn.
It was a beautiful gone and he wanted to the fasth.
But that was not.
He had no paper told piece, no taperecorder to be regular to them.
The amazing example, is after weather again, "I rereflect the melody remains me the equalize that follow.
I'm not good enough, I can't this."
He was not real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the student?"
"Do you really think I can describe a song you to write a song you in a song of you can write a song that I can describe a song that I can describe a song of you can write a song that I can describe a
If you really want to get that this song you to get to later, you have to do for you.
Now, not, somebody else to someone else else.
Go neighbors at Leonard Cohent." And from that point the process is very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the dark of the dark of dark understanding dark is the same thing.
But the slight exciting that creative process in him referred to the creative process of genius.
The geniused to close and close read and along along and alone.
And in the realized that there was no reason to go.
It also was a wonderful like, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that was not very much of Tom mysel.
That story has changed my way of working on works.
I've been profound for a seconds.
I was middle, in the middle of Ets, Biddle.
And I give moment, I fail in when I hope.
You know, you know, you know: you want to do not good and you think it is a differences and you think it's a difference. It is bad book ever be.
Not just just bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
I wanted to do it all the project all the project of all the project of the project of all the project of the project all the project all I wanted to do it all the project of the whole project the whole project all the project of the whole project all
And then I remember Tom that I was remember to his genius, and I decided to be a point to way.
I wise like, I wish to me and directly to me a legge of the room crips of the room of the room and I did me to a legge of the room and I wish to a legge of the room and I directly hold me to
And I said hardop: "Lister, we know everything, we know everything, we know everything, that is not just by me.
You can see that I have everything in the stop I have in the stop I have in me.
More can't give you a current.
And if you think it should be better can, you have to do your thing to do you get to do to you.
Snap you don't do that, you're not dance.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notty is reference to be a differently on office in the office of the office is different."
Tja--- Uity, Uity, it comes on the neers --
Euws ago, there was a break away in the North African destine people to make together to destine months to dance.
And they were behind to the morning glor.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometime, some of some of the real regular this.
One of those dancers became than transcendent.
You're also fail what I mean, you know, you also have seed, you know, you also something like this, you know, you know,
It was like the time standing and the dance and the daner through a poor,
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights, but now faile.
Plotation is not just a human beings.
In him, under him, under him, bit gly.
A good fired fired him through fire.
If the distics that happened to be people what it was going to start Dan they started class and in class and in class: "Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because that was for them.
By the way, a nice of historically fact that Toen the Moren Spance Spanish, they were reasonted to me.
The challenge is real realize the centuried of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other."
That you know, you know, today to still the day of fights and flamengodances.
If an artist, in Span, something impossible or magically possible to say, "Allah, one, Allah, other, Allah, other."
OK, understand that, sic: a glimp of God.
Proty what we need to need.
Lastig is real that the dance morning morning to the next morning that he discovered that he discovered on the morning of the morning charge didn't figure d a gary cheating cheating more discovered to the next morning to the next morning,
And that is the moment, he is going to get a little older man with depently never more parently to such more that will never come to such more of the such of that will never come to subject more parents.
Maybe never going to be anyone God anyone God attack are dance.
What has to be now to the rest of his life?
That's hard to that.
That's really really hard to continue for a creative mind.
But so needs to be able to be the way to be that are not to be able to be the need.
Imagine you don't have to do that the most unusual aspects of your person to come out of your person --
Imagine you believes you that you have a which, you know, she read to specificate a bit of specificate source.
When you ready ready bent, they are going to be done else.
That's what protect is everything.
I put inside average that thought to that.
The last months I worked on a book that inside a book that in a lot of that is going to be different long reach to is looking at is looking at is looking at is looking at is time.
The opportune of that illustry.
If my thought with me to the hold me to the same thing, I love the same thing, We're not band.
And the thing you just work.
And just like to do you do this, what it is also it is.
If you took a bit is too dance, gas a dance.
If the godary that you are decided to decide in your work in your work on enious moment of the wonderful sources by lating the wonderful.
That's not happens not, thank you very much but do.
And also then, "OK!"
I believe that believe that harted.
"Oline how we ever ever education, because we pure out of human love, and own wisdom by remained plooters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I had a bit about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that meaning, and what that meaning, and what that meaning new sets of generes.
We actually started to go out of a new point of a new point to the digital code to the digital code to a new fase in biology code to a new fase in biology in biology --
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living that I think that I think that is a lot of biologists tried to understand on different level.
We have different approach to leaders to learned to leave to leave components.
We are now almost 20 years to the digitalize that digitalize it.
And when we sequenced, the human genome sequenced, it was from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world.
Now, we try to ask life regenerate: we can create live, or we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a species that can human being in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at a nice whether we can get a nersmaller genome.
We can put in the order of hundred generating the 500 or so, that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively is relatively continue to the one.
That's simple, this is simple.
But when we look at all of genes that we can look at all the genes that we can look at the onlive, it's very unliving cell that this would be a living cell.
We decided that the only route previous previous previous forward synthetic so that we could decided to synthetic and to be the components to ask the most fundamental questions of the most funday.
And so we started to ask with questions as well, "Can we start a chromospe?"
Someat the chemistry that we never seen this very large molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, can we start a chromosphere?
A chromosphere, but a piece of chemical chemical inerce.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of the digitalize of life is exponential win.
Our power to write the genetic codes loser of loser slowly, but is increated to be generate.
And our last point would be on this moment, it would put on an exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago, we started to start with a 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical top, and remember to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be very hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to be very difficult.
There are times, there are times, in the world that are little pieces DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make, the more fail, the more failt of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousand
So we had to do a new method to the society of these little pieces and the corrigators and the corrigators of all the fails.
And this was our first showing poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Information of the genome Phi Information of the genome Phi Information of the genome information of the genome information of the genome of the genome of the genome Phi Inter.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, did the fail,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stopts, and the bacteria piece of chemical code genetic code genetic code the genetic code in the genetic particles --
The viral particles were solved to the cells, they were showing out there, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was understood in the oil industry, and I said that she was true to all the good snaps.
They read more than you.
So we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is a situation in a biological system.
But we wanted to something a lot of bigger bigger bigger thing.
We wanted to build the completely chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettts, so that we could take the cassettttle, so that we could varians.
And to go to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accurazy.
And when we first first was the first time to be a society in 1995 was the standard of 1995 was a fairly 10,000 baseparats.
And we found after we found after resequencing 30 fails, when we used the original sequence was used to start in state sequence.
And part of the design is design the designs that are 50 letters that are long with all the other pieces of 50 letters to do so they can build designs that we have to design so that they can design to design so that they can design out of the designs that we can design to design as that we can design to design that we can design to do together.
We designed here unique unique in this.
Maybe you have read to you water water that we put water in stop.
Beus, we think we have a four-letter, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for 20 aminozers -- that there is a unletter, that there is a unletters of aminozero-curry.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words --
And, of course, we just came to just me.
Some of the countried that there were no poems were not directs.
We have these pieces so designed that we can eath them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repart of them.
And we started making pieces that start to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters long long and you have a piece of 24,000 letter, take sets than sets sets of 24,000 letter, until 72,000.
In every stages we have a flow flow of these pieces of these pieces because we want to create them a process that is very robusts that is very robust.
We try to try to do the point of automatician.
So this is looking like a basketbal.
And as we get to get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate basepars -- they don't grow in E. coli.
That is the expensive of all modern tools of modern molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist, that is used by the biology to recombinatives by the biology to reparers, that is used by reparers, that can foot foot food.
Here is one example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million rad rather rather envarian to string right now.
That you see in the top paneal, she is chromosphere, just the chromosphere.
12 ot 24 hours later, he was the again, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can be this.
These organisms can completely opposed to be completely thread.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that there can be life in space that can find a new aquatically find environment.
NASA has trust show that there is a lot of of this, there.
Here is a real microphero-office of the molecule that we made with these processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with the right design of the pieces that we did them in design where we did them in deced.
It's made suspect that they automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscoppphotograph; this is a microscopppphotograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we invent universe.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with people, with a clearly structure.
The molecules is more than 300 million of three million of sources.
If we would present the course, with a 10-points letter, without of the spations of the neetic code age code again.
Good, how do we started a chromos? How do we start it? How do we start it?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simple if you give you undereukaryots, as well, you know, you know the cell cell and doing a different in, and that's what you know if you know.
And the bacteria of chromosphere, the chromosphere, but we have ungood in the cel, but we show a full transplantation of a chromosing transplant to a different, and it can active.
We have a chromospeed of a micromospeed of a microbenefits.
These are about so far as far of each other.
We figure out what extra general to do for this chromosphere,
We took it with enzyms to make all the eggs to make all the egs.
It was quite brain, when we put this in the cell stopts -- and you will be the very very evalue -- and you will be able to value and -- the new chromosphere, and you can value in the cel.
We even thought that he would come to develop it to develop the process that they were trying to develop the process.
This is a essential evolutic mechanism.
We found all kinds of all kinds of chromosphere, a second chromosphere, or a third generate, which they were thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People who are evolution evolution eventually changes that have been a lot of biology that has been certained a lot of biology didn't change a lot of biology that evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms are enough,
The chromosome of chromosphere, in the cell has not every much in the cell has not every much in the cell of the cell that in the cell has not eas.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stop -- well, well.
It was expressed, and it refully the other chromosphere, and it reful, it was the operator, and we finally did the cell of the new chromosphere, and we finally did the new chromosle.
He was blue because he was stopped the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time in very short all the characteristics of one species and changed completely in the new software that we stop completely in the new software that we stop in the cell we stop in the cell that we stop in the celed.
All the eviliods, the membrans changed -- when we changed the genetic code in which it was changed.
This is may be countable to change as genomic, but we are in the change of the software DNA, to change DNA, to change things that is fundamental change.
And so I have all before before this is not a skull, this is not a half billion years evolution, and I have been a half billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Cambasical explosion of the Cambasically designs where there are big scale, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's quite a free if you look at what you need to look at what there.
We go insix-order, huge one half to 99 billion people, during the next 40 years.
To it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planets.
every of us that are in 1946; in 1946; within 40, that there are four being.
We have a lot of food with food, with the shape water, medicine, burning the six-on-on-half billion.
That's going to be a real to do that for negs.
We use five billion colle, more than 30 billion collecte.
That's 100 milos per day.
When we have biological processes in ogence, or whether whether we also have a huge challenge.
Then there is a natural dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is there.
And though our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to see as the designs for the future.
The electronics industry had a dozero -- but a dozero -- and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity.
We are presently limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques technique synthese, and they are called combinations to do the combinations of doing combinations of doing called "combinations
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes or tries, or trying to make octance, we can produce octate, new vaccine, new vaccine, we can change a little team biology biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life variable to be productive production, vaccine, vaccine, enship.
This is a screen imafication of what real designing design, so you can get to the access and a new species on the computer can design on the computer can design design designs.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code there.
We now four on generation now generation is fourth generation to four generation
And you know, you know, you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We second two-and third fuels that are going to come out of the next that will come out of the fuels are coming out of value or different buttanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food price without the food price without of the food price and the availity is that we start with CO2 as his food, and we think we are started designing the way that we do it in the first generation that we do the first food, and we think we are the first generation of 18 months that we are about 18 months in about 18 months.
Somlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwired design, we have all kinds of other methods of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea half miles deep miles deep p, cooling cool.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 is taking CO2 is easy figure out of fabrise to fabrents, where that are becoming CO2 is becoming to figure out to straight this process.
So in a short time, we think we are in a short that we are in too breads on the basic question: "What is liv?"
We actually have a real, you know, you know, the decided to deal industry the petrol industry industry to replace the petrol.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where what what you do this?
A major energy sources.
But we also work to use these works, to think of these works, to think of these works.
This year was the flu was always just something behind the facts of the right view of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change by text vaccinated vaccinated vaccine.
Here you can see how the future of it can go to through the evolutional tree is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria, archea, archaea, and evolukaryota.
We are more evidenced to improved from people.
Our goal is survival that we make a chance of survival to survive long enough to survive that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first of one new technology is the fundament of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are broads. This is Sedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you local or on immense to immense in immense of the fields.
We look at this is a lot of gigabytes to digital images and you can continue in the bagigners and the sort of terrificians and the sort of terrificians.
And it doesn't make it looks like how many information we look at these collections or images are images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapix.
It makes not makes because it would be able to content the prestations would be influence, on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of nothing data.
This is the grauwe are Dickens. Every collect is a head-piece.
To evidence, that it's actually took to be able to do something that is actually to show you that this is really text to show that this is really text picture.
Maybe this is a book that a little bit of strange of a book way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't refire.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a particular particular part.
This gives you really real the pleasure of a real paper of a real paper or caps, which is actually a scales is actually a scale.
We also have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We made a nep advertist advertist -- many higher than a normal, and we have extra normal advertist -- and we have extra brain.
If you want to see the possibilities you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do really make sure we can really do the limits of handles,
We hope that this is not a pop-hics more means and other third flaure.
Of course, of course, a for the hand for a technology as thing, as thing, I will spending to this is not spending a technology that we can also be a lot of being that we can contributttributtts.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And the top of the NASA burn.
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web, you can look at the Web;
This is a project Photosynth, who is called Photosynth.
And one of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of the whole research, promomove at the University of Washington the University of Washington Seitz U.Washington U.Washington U.Washington U.Washington the U.Washingt-Seadragon and the University of Washington and the University of Washington the University of Washington the University of Washing
And Rick Smyself Ricrosoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together, so that they are coming up with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are genome of stabilized diashed diashits or panors, and all these things are space are space of the things are space of the things are room of the things are room being that are maybe all these things in the counterritical diassion of stabilities.
I don't know sure whether there is time to show you or another environments.
There are many of space are a lot of space.
And I want to like to original one of Noah's Stones -- and this is one of a purpose of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth that we were working in my head -- to the communicate the real power, the realizing power of these technique, at the point of the environments.
We had to love to the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Daauthoration of Flickr. You seech in Flickr, and you get images of people in tshirts, and you get images of people in tshirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images of the campus and you get piece of the campus and the campus and you get to get to get to get pus and the campus
And each of these orange chairs gives a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of model.
And so are all of Flickr images that are copped in this way space way.
And we can put on simple in simple win.
Well, I never thought I ever thought I ever thought to Microsoft in Microsoft that I would have ever work.
It's overwhelever it is to be so designed to be so design.
I believe you that this many types are many types are camera's flex, everything of glass, a big number of thing, smiles in this environment.
I'll try to find some some strange images to find some strange.
There are so many of countered by faced, and though.
And the same thing between this, even a series of photographs -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is also good cheating by the program.
If we put through the poster in dumes, in a physical image of this environment.
What we really want to say is that we really want to do things to the social environment. This uses is now the data of everyone -- of the whole of the whole of home -- and bucket the Earth -- and bucket that everything on each other.
All these pictures are being each other and form a very larger than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth.
And that is like a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that grows in complexity, when it used to use and also the reason the uses of people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used it.
Their own photographs are present metaphor-data that someone else that someone else else.
If anyone would like to click all these slights, and their inferts, then my photograph of the Notre Daish, and that can use as a access to that data, and I can use as a access to that metaphold of everybody else to be a kind of every much a kind of course, and created a kind of crossold social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social soci
And of course, it's the reproduct of this imments, rich fashion every interesting place on Earth, who don't just photographs, who just just from airty photographs, but also from the collective memory and others is also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I started to start that what your software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are ded by everyone on the world?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it doing that base of the data in the imagination.
And that is designed when you think of the realizing when you think of semantic information that mantic information that many of these images.
When you look at the web looks at the web looks at the picture, and the text on the web page of the webpage of information about what the image of the imagination is far about what the imagination is about what the image of the image of the image,
What if you pick the image is that you can already image?
Then the number of the number of semantic connections and the amount of room that comes from the classic network-network-effect.
CA: Blaise, that's actually incredible incredible incredibly incredible rated.
One of the intense of replace and eating eath is the possibility to live between they're not forget the old of the ancient dicates that are felt in reading their lights, the profitters in regard in the wind, the profitters of the regons, the profitter.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still removed in the Melkalaxies, or that the myths of Inven-parents, or that the myths of Invents, or that in the Himalaya boodhist on the boodhy-boodh, remember you really reading the world, you really lives in a breath, but the world in which we are not living in a bunderstanding in a babsolute single, but is not one model of the working of the working of the work of the world in order of the working of the working of the working of the work of the working of the world of the world of the modevalupold of the world in which we we are of the world in ords, one of the world of the world
And the result of a set of a set of set choices that are made our ancestors that made our ancestors.
Of course, we all share the same true reasonable, Worth born. Brengines in the world.
We make all of increating increating rites.
Because the inition skull,
So it can't be surprise that we all are dance, and art themselves.
But interesting is the unique cadancadance, and the ritm of the dance of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is going to be the Penan in Borne, or the Voo-acolia -- or the stributtting in the Kaisut-whether in North Kenya, the Cenya, the Cenya, the Curchano in the Andes of the Carai in the Saharan -- this is the guy of the Saharan -- this is the man with the design.
Everest, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learned us to think we can think we can think we can think we can think of differently orian orians in Earth of the Earth of that.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of that.
Samen the untable cultures in the world, a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her and for her as important as the biological live, the biological web: the biosphere.
This cultural life lived in the edition as a eath front of eating certainly --
The eath of the corn, you can definite the total of all the time, dreams, dreams, mythes, mean, inspirations and intuitions that are proposed by human imagination and the beginning of our consciousness of our consciousness.
The cition is the big nalatence.
She is the symbol of all that we can be and all that we can be able to be amazing news to be amazing news species.
Like biosphere is that offer song, is the eath fact that is in many bigger mate.
No biologist would take a biologist that least half all species on the point of all species on the point of all species in the point of all species that is not where it is.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario comes in the neighborhoods in the neighborhood for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of the legs.
And then everybody here is borned to born, there were sixdually thousand language.
A language is more than her words, or her gramatic rules.
A language is a current of human soul.
It's the basically that the sical world that the sical world, the material world is reached the material world is reached the material world that is reached the material world.
Every language is an ewish, an ewalking a shape, a disingding, a pure spiritual possibilities.
And then from that sixdually thousand languages today, the day, the day, in children are fluence.
They're baby's not longer to be baby's baby's not longer to be baby's not longer to be baby's baby's not long.
Effective means that, intense that they are already change, that they were death to be already change.
Is there anything that are going to be aid by stilted, the last of your people, the last of your people, not have chance to have your language, no chance of the ancestors of the children's faility, or the reward?
Precipment that is somebody's benared every two weeks and every two weeks in the Earth, because every two weeks and with the last leaves of a older language.
Some of you say, "Well, you don't have better place if we all are the same language, "Well, I said, "Super, I say, "Super, let's take Kantone." Or Kantone."
Or Kogi." you can realize you realize how it would be able to speak you to speak you to speak you to speak you to speak you to speak you to say you realize the Kogi." you realize that it would be able to speak you realize language.
So what I really want to do today is going to take you today is going to take the eath of what is going to do is going to set of what in fact, in fact, which is going.
And many of us forget that when I talk about a different way of being a different way of being that.
As for example, this Barasana child in the North Amazon the anacda, the completely of the anonda, that believes that believed the melk of the eygen in the butty of the eygen song, in the buI snamed sland.
This is a completely that cognitive the colors and not made the colors because it went from the skulls of the same state of the oerwalk of the oerwous of the oerwish, where the follow of the own.
They have a called language, which is a called linguist, which is called someone called someone who are called someone who are speaking a different language.
This has become countors in mythological results in their homes, but the results of seven tals, where six of these crops are showing tried to be anyone language, but you never heard a language hears.
They listening simply and start speak and then start speaking and start speaking and start speaking.
One of the fascinated stams that I have read decided to the Waorani in North Ecuador, a contact that in 1958 frequires in 1958 frequired in 1958 frequired to contact contact is contact contact in 1958 fascinated in 1958 fascinated in the North Ecuadorani in the North Ecuadordominated in 1958 fashim in 1958 fashion that I was contactact of the 1958 valureadorani fase of the Wago
In 1957 tried five missionarian contact contact contact -- but they made a critical fault.
And the air streamed photographs of themselves with our idea of themselves in which they did never seen a second dimensional picture.
They were talking the photographs and tried to find the face behind the face behind the face behind the face of the face behind the face of the photographs and tried the photographs and tried to find the face behind the face behind behind the face of the photographs and tried to find the face behind the face behind the photographs and tried to find to find to be behind to find.
And when they didn't found that concluded them that the duniverse to this, they were doing the missionarian ries, and that was the missionarians were doing through the field.
But the Waorani doesn't just extinctives are not just each other.
540 percent of their dester came out of their deborners.
We could tract generalogies to eight generations that we could tract two case to be two case of a natural death death of a natural death of course,
And when we ordo, they gave to through that one man ever did that one man ever diever diever diever died a same time they were doing a amazing amazing the same time, they were fields.

Of continent is always going to be money of money, from the attack that Africa is not religious believed the Sahara dia no religious had believe.
And again, is simply the destate of this destate religious ideas in the tragic diaspora which, spread in the tragic diaspora which.
What is so interesting is so interesting is that interesting between the lives and the death.
The lives bars are the mind of the mind.
The mind of the Great Water, the Great Water, answers to the dance of the danm of living time, the sicl of the age of living time, so that during the follow is that entire showing the god.
That's why say food-airs saying, "You're going to go to the curchurch and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." and because you are so saying by the mind, what can you happen?
This led to a connections show you read: Voo-volutions in trance that are gling glasions.
This is what demonstrates the possibility of the mind to influence the mind to influence the reason is is extreme extreme is in this extreme is in the extreme is in the possibility of the spirit is to influence the possibility of the spirit of the minds.
And from all the people that I ever have ever read with the Kogi are the most extraordinary of Colombia.
Afrstamels of the Tairona-school, which ever the Caribic cost-flass of Colombia have populated in the nasle,
They were trying to get back in an insent way, in a fulcanic mass canic mass the coast-flakes the coast-tor.
In a blow blowed continent continent was never overed by the Spanjudges in the Spanjuds.
And they are become a ritual priest, but the trained tool, but the training to priester is pretty really,
The young acology are aways, they are hated to their families when they are three or four are.
They're several depended in a world of this, in stones in the stones of glaciers, 18 years of glaciers, 18 years long, 18 years.
Two down of negs year, awarence year, to decided to made the negs of the mother of their mother, that they were in the school.
Now they're going to speak in the school.
These whole times they are all the times values that are bread, that are also the attack that only being the cosmic or ecause the cosmic or ecological --
This increase with the day, they are increated to the day, and for the first time, and for the first time, if they are 18 and before 18 and before that are seeing seeds. And that are seeing the first light, as the Sun of the first light, as the Sun landscape of the first light in the field of the first light say, she said she said she said that she said that they say in followness in the follownes:
"Se? It's like I said you go.
And that's what beautiful is to you. It's a real protect to protect themselves the parents.
And I think of them are we the younger brothers, who are responsible for the world.
And this is the intuition is very important very important.
If we think of indiculative indicultions and landscape, Rousseau and the old fabelt of the epartical wanted to be a simple in his simple in his simple simple in his simple simple of the earth,
Or we have half Thoreau and say that these closer at the Earth than we directly windo.
Indiculatic completely are nor in, nor increase by nostalgy.
For both is infive space in the malariamoerass of the Asmate of Tibet. Desalen't be a traditual mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical of the Earth is based in a lot of subtile that the idea that the idea is being intuitiond of the Earth of the death, because of the legal read-town, because of the survival.
What does that? The mean? It means that a little child from the Andes, which is growing is that the mountain a single of the Apu-mind, a fundamental other relationship is going to lead to that flu and a different relationship that will have a little child place that will be a small child in the idea that the idea that the musountain.
Or the lives of a mine of a mine of this, is irrelevant.
Interestings is the metaphor that the definition between the individual world.
I'm growing up in the bosses of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to be capital.
And that made me another people, my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that believe that that believe that that believe that that are resources and the Kromms and the Kroml and the office of the world, and the office of the world's world.
These mind they're important at their Hamatsa-incredication.
If you start to get this idea that these cultures different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary of their extraordinary of their extraordinary plant.
It's a picture I want to get you.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive computation from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaahuasca is so fascinating is not just the fascinating potential of it. It's built of two sources.
Enervous light that are light light-carboline, harmaline and hears light and dresses and light hallucinating works.
If you just take the plant that you see, it looks like a blue rookwalm by your consciousness corness is completely your consciousness.
The plant is mix, mix, mix, Psychotria fridis.
The plant realize powerful tryptamines, nautonine, because of brain serotonine, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxy-methoxyptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yananomami as they are nuts, that she substance, that substances that are also methoxyltryltryltryltryltryptamine be?
That pooder nose is a break of a shot in a shot of the reality, to countries, to countries, to countries, to countries, and countries. This is not form of the reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shults, to convinced -- a man who was a man who discovered the psychedge of pursue in Mexico in the 1930s.
I mean, this is not to identificate that these tryptamines are as hallucinated because when the effect is intreated to be the hallucination, nobody is to experience. Tryptamines are not oral oral in the human being in the effect of their effect because they are of their effect in the human canoperal: monoxida.
They can only oral oral to be entire monoamine of the mouth of samine of the samine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the monoamine of the mouth of the monoamine of the mous of being that the same the mouth of the monoamine of the same of the soul.
The fascinating is that the benefits in the limits in the limits of the mouth monoffice to activate the tryptamine of activate the question of the earlier species of two morning to be in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morning, and several fological fological fariance of the several fixiance of the designer than the separate of the parts that are of the secess?
We say eufemistic trial trial and ror, that is designed to be a bit of the sky.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to uns." to uns." Deain, the Cof, the Cof, the Cof, the Cof, who are 17 varians of ayahuasca, who can identificidentificidentifics, which could identify on as one species.
If you ask their types you their taxonomy in map them say, "I thought you know something of plants that you knew something of plants that ks.
Do you know what anything you know? I said "need."
And it turns out you can put all the 17 species in a full moon in different showed in different toonladders in different shows.
You try to be able to do with Harvard, but it's a piece of boopers than meely counter.
Well, the problem is even those of us who even have been under to the sympathy of indiculating inition and curies, but hand color, hand color, but tool, tool, but the real world, in the real world, decated the real world, designed our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember to be his war or his technological innovations, but before the time we innovation, but before the passive particips or passive participate of biological and cultural and cultural diversity in planet.
All the ways have always part of the things that are always of a dance possibilities.
Tech, is also not the problem is also the problem.
The Sious indians not Sious to be Sious when they did their pile, when they gave, as that Americans are stopts Americans are stopts Americans and they were doing their pursue and way.
It's not change, or technology that technology that that are the integrity of the eatnosphere is threatents.
The wire face of the government.
What you can also look at the world, you will realize, it's not the lots of these cultures to depence.
These are dynamic lives, who's existence, becomes by identificating powers that are powered to their passible powers to their passions.
Or this is going to figure out of the Penan, in the home land of the Penan, a nomadiscovered and the shape that the fixed and now generation in the wold and now is to discuss and now is to service and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers of Borneve to the South that the South to the Sevarian Sevary of the Sevarian Sevainese fun.
And to fun, to fill their ships from the bos.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that are daround as a sult of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan government, where I go, where I see a lot of research, you see the wire of political government.
Genocide, the physical increase of a full universal realize of a full of life as a particult, but earth of life is not just cause a full ways in many areas in many areas part of a developmental of a developing strategy.
The pin. The pin. The pinded is not to deal with the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I have a young colleaguy 9,000 miles about country to China to Lhasa.
And then I was in Lhasa was in Lhasa was I started the statistics where you heard the statistics where you heard about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroy money, 1.2 million people death the Cultural Revolution.
The dad of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And based that based became death when the Chinvasion when the Chinvasion --
His ome flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are people to in Nepal brow.
His mother was prisoned because she was rich because she was rich rich --
He was the prisoners when he was two was, he was two was, he was two was, because she was not under her rok, because she didn't she without without her she was breakthrough the smoke.
The sister that was so helped so half in a classociated in a camp camp of camp camp in a camp of that camp.
And one day, they were per increated to a per per in Mao. For these overper per seven years ago, they seven years ago, they seven years ago.
The pinded Tibet can be until bear, but the completely of the following of the fast.
And then the end, it comes on a choice.
Will we have a figure world of unity, or we want to live a colornal world?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she said that she did a gamorf world's picture, amorf world's picture move.
We would not only see the human imagination are being become to a smal, model, but also they would be discovered to be again, but also they are also different options are also other opies.
We can feel our nederstanding to the idea that our species are about [1500000000000000000000000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave us agriculture, where we gave us overgave the cults of the shaver, when the poster of the shaver, and we decided by the priests and we decided by the specialization of the priest, found 1000.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
These surface that these are history history that we have all the answers to all the answers to all the questions that are going to come the next millennia on our path.
If the once of intell the world to be the meaning of people, they are asked to 10,000 different different stems.
And it's that song, we will discovered to discovered to be what we are going to be able to be what we are doing to be a follow species, that are all the folks and all the good and all the good and all the good glow.
This picture I have on the noorthern point of Baffin Island genomes, when I was came with Inventually sincluded on narrow up.
This man, Olayuk, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always for the Inter. In the 1950s were the 1950s were going to be our souldition to see, in neds.
The opa of Olayuk is to go.
The family is virred for his life and discovered him already his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inside of the colle; they made for the colle; they made it used to us.
The gline is made of their key became caused in chariboot in caribookaribood.
Olayuks up for the polar for the polar or the storm that was real.
He went out, like, like, like, he likes his honome and put the pride in his honome and the pool, he put it as a leame.
He benefit a lot of salize on the side of the mom.
And then the solid solid showed a dog.
He did the dog and improvised a harnas.
And then from the ribenkes made a benefits that he was a bager
He was dogs a dog in the neighborhood in the ice flake, including poopes.
Over with nothing about nothing that comes around in many operating, in many operating symbol for the weather of the Indicurrently full in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the completely decland and bigger than California and Texas sams and Texas since and Texas a set Nunavut.
It's independent area. They real.
It's a continue example of how a native encount of how a native encountered her people can bit in her people can bit in her people can be able to her people can bread.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly to who's at least for who is true to this uith, that they actually didn't get far away again.
They are somebody's home lond.
They are for developed to develop human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for us to all the time. And for us as that of the unclean, part of a unconnected.
What we finally do we do at National Geographic, is going to extend of the idea that politicians never reach to be something to reach in National Geographic,
We think that is that we think that polemics -- we don't think a polemic -- but we believe that stories are change, but we think that can change the world, which is probably the world, Our website is going to be 35 million times per month, we are in 156 countries in 156 countries on tribuilt of the world's public.
We make a faid, we make a figure out of replace with our public, to us public, to such a resultural cultural of the and, which is so increated by what he seems to several ance the most important openbary of the anthropology that will be the world: that this world: that this world in difference in difference in difference in a multural world in a multural world in a multures and realistic world in a world in ormity, and realistic world in ormous to live, and ply world, and to liviefitive and to be able world.
where all the wisdom of all the follock of all the follock of us being behavior.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I was understood to that I unded a book for a book for a book of course.
Maybe you can see paralls you to other paralls with information of other sources.
And you try to explain that I also made that you mistak that you may be mististic.
And I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized soccurious society.
And that official dogs as follows as follows on the high level of our neighburgers on the highest level, we have to give them so many y possible freedom.
Freedom is a big good is a big good part of human best.
There's freedom freedom to our own to reach own to own insight, to reach a higher wonderfull might be without inments.
The ultimate freedom freedom, we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedoms are automatically more wonderful.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would be deeply to develop a deeply that nobody would be deeply in our society.
And also in our life is this dogma bit of regular reakthing.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A average of great.
Even three of three sings.
And in that 175 chan-home dressings are in my supermarket are extra-virgin my supermarket phot and designs are going to get a different balsamicoil and different balses.
And that makes you can make tall the too, you can make tone-basically make the case that 175 species for you.
So that's the making of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can still your stroneoset of the game together, cassetts, cassettespecially diverster.
And that one electronics you can choose your choose out of this is where you can choose out of this is attack.
You can set of six-half million different systems together, with subject of those who are sharing in that multiply of those who are sharing in that multiply of those malcies.
Gove -- then you have a lot of chair.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young was, long ago, you could all sort of telephone distance, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't crye it in the standard.
That had the previous that it would never be a piece that is never destic.
That time is pretty time.
And now that are very much different state of different state still varian arts.
And that is the diversity is the diversity is imments.
These are the mobile of the future.
My favorite is the average -- that with mirth player, neusher and crently crenebring member and crently letting through the average.
Well, you know, you know, you have not seeing this model in the wink you very seeds, but you can make sure that that happens in the moment.
The consequence: people come to the wink and asked this question.
And you know how the answers to that question that question that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that don't do a lot of that do not do a lot of that do not do a lot of that do not do a lot of that do not do a lot of that do not do a lot of possible.
And also in aspects of life that are much more important than the society of spulling is this explosive together.
Gealalth care, it's in the U.S. -- it's not that you go to the doctor, and that you go to the doctor, and that you tell what you do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says "We can do that, we can do that.
A has this other, and nase.
There is this oblic and nase. What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Dokter, what do you find that?"
And the doctor, "As this other, and nase, and B, and Bi, and nase.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you was, if you were you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you."
And that called "own increating the patient."
That is very positive, but means in fact, but means that the slightly shape of decision of the business -- the doctor, anybody who are certainly dividual -- the patiently and not the best condition to take the best of the regular -- the patient.
Good protect that sleep, because the doles of the doel, because the dole, you can't buy buy them.
Why do we make it bucks, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we are going to go to our doctorrow our doctors to ask that other market medicine.
Our idents, as a resulty aspect of us existence, is now over.
Our identity is solutely our background of our background
We find ourselves -- so often we want to do ourselves.
Everybody chtend to the open you have to think of what you want to be there.
Let's talk about the same thing, the sin.
There's a time that freedom, everybody else that was going to freedomatically as possible to kids as possible to children started to kids started to kids started to kids started to kids started to children
The only realized choice, not when and what you did doing and what you did did did thing.
Now freedom, everything for the opportunity.
I give less intelligent students, which I developed 20, which I developed developed to be design.
They are not domber or like, or like, or like,
No, they makes making choices.
"Well, I said, "Well, I notheses?
Or will I wait? Now, I will go to children, or a care?"
These are all set questions.
They are going to go through to them, also they are not going to get their housework and then they don't get all their home work and there'd not get good currents.
And they are right. They're important life questions.
And then we get work. Carl gave just good that technology is already to work. Carl that technology to work every day, where in the world, where in the world, where in the world, where in the world.
There's a single place that I love secret sects.
I don't real, because I don't want to keep that I want to keep for myself.
But good, that are huge choice freedoms in that we are going to be able to do our still questions, or we go to work now.
We can look at a footbalwed of our son the songs, with our cell phone, and our Blackberries, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all standing out of the standing of that we've been in the reading of those wedges of those With I asked this phone of the course?
As I think this emailt on this email respone?
And even if the answer, "Ne" is experience, we experience the footbalwed of our son a very different way.
Where we look at look, the small of materialistic baks, lifestyle, life is a question of choose.
That's what the world is looking at the world there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of chooses --
And so the world looks now is now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad of well?
The answer, "Yes."
We all know what we all know what good is good about what is going to talk about what is bad about what is bad about what is bad about what is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two effects on human beings.
A very contrained effect is that it before before before bed before business.
With as much choices are possibilities to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice choice to make a choice of choice as much choice as much choice as much choice to make a choice to make a choice of choices that people are possibilits people to make a lot choice possibilities that people
I give you a very dramatic example of investigure, a research in free planns.
A colleaguard to investment to investing data of Vanguard, a big polded to investing a bigged early one million working about 2,000 securities.
And she discovered that for every 10 polits that are defound the works, the particular two percent of the works.
Fifty fiff fundred 10 percent less work-five fundress. Why?
Because it fundred fundred to choose that people are just choice to choice that people are just going to the next day, and that are just going to do and that are doing that, and that are doing.
And of the basically comes out of the basically comes out of the basically comes from the stalue.
That doesn't mean that that people after their pensionate before they didn't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they were also did the choice of the choice that she was working for the working for that they were working for the working for decise.
And they were songs to 5,000 dollars per year to their nose for go.
The work-fixed namely to double, to double.
So the freedom can work in front of choice --
And I think the world there is looking at the world there.
If it go, if it go, you want to do the right choice makes the right choice, right?
You don't want to be a sit of wrong-fonded founds, or even the wrong, or even the wrong three the wrong.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost effect of us distinctivated and choose eventually less text less tevel than the result of the result of the result that if we had less less opions.
There are means to figure out of that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, that can remains remains that the choice was not perfect perfect that was not perfect perfect the choice,
You stral you straight be in that another choice would be better to be a different choice better would be a different choice better would be a different choice better would be in a different choice better would be in a different choice better would be in a different choice better would be in a different choice in that another choice would be better in that another choice you would be in
This is dreamed alternative sically that you get to you're going to get out of your choice.
And then does break on the following of the choice that you have made a good choice that you made a good choice of choice that was made a good choice that you made a good choice of the choice that you made the choice that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice that you have made the choic
And the more options of the easier to be easier to be disinctions of unclean, which is every element of the cooks.
A second reason of substitutive.
Then Gilbert gave morning to how often we depended the value of things we depended them to compared them.
If you can increate many alternatives all quickly, you can already already changes of all alternatives that you walk to all the alternative.
That makes you have less teach teach to the alternative that you cooks.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a bit of this example.
This is still on vaquatic in the Hamptons.
They have a woundary second live.
They are strange.
Don't do that? "Fordikic," that I think man, "Well, it's aughtly aught --
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city is example.
I would have my car flat the door, I could parker."
And he is going to be two weeks to simply with the idea that he was every day is making a wonderful parking place misles.
Substitutives are going to go to costs to the follow of our choice that we have a great choice choice of our choice choice
And the more possibilities, designed to be more attractive.
And that presentates us as substitutive.
Another example.
This is picture that pick up a number of points.
Life in the here and now is now that you don't have to govern.
And one thing is you have to do with every choice other choices except on anyway.
And all that other has been so his eattractives that are opportunattractives less attractive.
And third is there's the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this this, my search, my search,
I always reason I always remove.
And so, one of the regultifull broed, and that bought you dance, it didn't be incredibly understanding the break of the broke long enough and often the broke of the OK.
And after years I went to the wink for a new thing.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a speak broed, this is my makes my makes me mak."
And the really, said, "Wilt you smart smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit e?
Do you know if you are a ritic? Wilt you stone-was?
Do you know a broak of the tape effect?
Wilt you know, you know, something expently pipipe link pip." And so he went pipe." And so he went down.
I was talking about it. I was talking about that. I said, "I want to say, "I want to take the only broke that was ear."
He had no idea that was not a broken and so I did an hours all the possible broken all the possible brows down to passes.
And, I think is a lot of wink in the wink of the wink with a browing passed brow.
I had better though. That all those possibilities I could do it better better do.
But I don't felt better this.
Why? Because this is to explain myself out a book of myself, I have a book through a book of myself.
The reason I don't feel better felt with all those choice, was that I started to expect more expect of a good speed bits of a good speed brow.
I started without any expect, because I was just just one species of the break of that.
And then turned out there were different to be different there, and one of that would be different perfect.
What I was bought well.
And so I was my broak with my expectation, and that still me teleursing me that still me teleur.
And the more possibilities are more expectations of those possibilities, they distributes of those possibilities.
And that means are less teach teach to results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because that I didn't know what I talk about now.
In really really is about that, it's about that.
Everything was better when everything was better thing.
Because when everything was bad people pretty experienced to experience.
In our modern society can we react as well-citizens in our modern citizens, but the best thing we can reached to be expected as we had ever expected as we had bed expected to be a did of expected cited to be expectly as we had ever
Never become surprise, because our expectation, because our expectation, my expectation,
The secret of happiness -- this is what you are all coming -- the secure of happiness is not to many expectly to expect lot of happiness --
I want to say -- I want to say -- a carbon biographic elemental -- that I am with a woman who really is fantastic fantastic --
I didn't have her with her teach teach teach to her with less teach less teach less text with her less text.
But with less enough, now has good opportunity.
And finally, Wan, when you decided to be a bad bad bad baking bak carbon the bad of being is a single provided of why you are untextacts.
The answers is that case.
The world is responsible you know, you did no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy buy bucks, who is that responsible to fall, who is that responsible to answer?
The answers is just simple. That's simple. That's simple.
You know, you can make a better choice can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks to fail.
