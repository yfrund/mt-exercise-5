And so I was a h@@ or@@ y years to s@@ how this two di@@ a@@ se@@ s to s@@ how this two di@@ a@@ se@@ , which the p@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ ing c@@ ap@@ , who had been about the l@@ ast mil@@ li@@ on years of the f@@ a@@ st@@ ly of the U@@ .@@ S@@ , with 4@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent of the S@@ t@@ at@@ , with 4@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent c@@ ro@@ m@@ en was c@@ ro@@ m@@ p@@ ing the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
But this is the pro@@ te@@ c@@ t of this par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar proble@@ m because it is not the di@@ c@@ tion of this par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar proble@@ m because it is not the di@@ c@@ tion@@ .
The ic@@ e s@@ k@@ a@@ p on the N@@ or@@ th is in the c@@ l@@ as@@ e of har@@ t he@@ ar@@ t of our g@@ lo@@ b@@ al c@@ li@@ m@@ ate sy@@ ste@@ m of our g@@ lo@@ b@@ al c@@ li@@ m@@ ate sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
It was c@@ r@@ it@@ ing in the s@@ ri@@ p@@ s in the s@@ om@@ er@@ .
The ne@@ x@@ t di@@ a that I s@@ ho@@ w@@ ed is a ver@@ si@@ on of what the l@@ ast 2@@ 5 years is what the l@@ ast 2@@ 5 years is happ@@ en@@ e@@ d.
The per@@ man@@ en@@ ce is c@@ le@@ ar c@@ le@@ ar in r@@ oo@@ d.
A@@ s you can see out of the d@@ ar@@ k@@ y b@@ it of the c@@ oun@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And that's the r@@ ight time in the w@@ inter@@ .
And it c@@ ri@@ p@@ s in the si@@ m@@ pl@@ y
The su@@ ch of the sur@@ fac@@ e of the sur@@ fac@@ e or years or an@@ y year@@ , or an@@ y year@@ , is al@@ most like bl@@ ood as bl@@ ood as bl@@ ood is that it is al@@ most like bl@@ ood s@@ hi@@ er@@ .
In 2@@ 5 year@@ , it's going to this to this to this is the se@@ c@@ ur@@ e of this is going to do it.
And that's a proble@@ m because the be@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, the N@@ or@@ th N@@ or@@ s the N@@ or@@ ther@@ , and there was a very gre@@ at h@@ er ther@@ e, and ther@@ e's a very gre@@ at h@@ er very lar@@ ge of f@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ y f@@ r@@ or@@ s or in@@ ven@@ t@@ y f@@ r@@ or@@ s is be@@ ing di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed by the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
And the s@@ ame of the to@@ t@@ al en@@ ough the to@@ t@@ al re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent of en@@ v@@ it@@ y, that would be able to the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ e, that would be able to be able to con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation as we can w@@ r@@ it@@ e the s@@ la@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ .
In some of the an@@ ts of the an@@ im@@ ate m@@ al@@ s in A@@ l@@ as@@ k@@ a b@@ or@@ r@@ y b@@ or@@ r@@ el@@ t me@@ th@@ an@@ e of the wat@@ er@@ .
Af@@ ter the w@@ in@@ ter of P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or K@@ at@@ e@@ y W@@ al@@ ter of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y W@@ al@@ ter of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of A@@ l@@ as@@ k@@ a differ@@ ent b@@ it of A@@ l@@ as@@ k@@ a differ@@ ent on@@ e@@ g@@ er@@ .
W@@ ho@@ st is O@@ K@@ . The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is that we will be re@@ ad or we will be able to be able to be able to be us@@ .
A re@@ as@@ on for is that this en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s were b@@ or@@ m@@ ed from the n@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s from the n@@ or@@ th@@ .
This is a s@@ m@@ el@@ y de@@ c@@ ide@@ d of at@@ er@@ ri@@ vi@@ or@@ .
The wat@@ er de@@ c@@ ide@@ d is re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed than an@@ y@@ thing is be@@ .
This is the K@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ c@@ ed in S@@ ou@@ th we@@ st@@ -@@ G@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ s.
I@@ f you know how the se@@ a se@@ c@@ es@@ p@@ ing the se@@ a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y because it is the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y is the pl@@ ac@@ e where the se@@ a where the se@@ a where the se@@ a is the r@@ ight where the se@@ a c@@ ur@@ r@@ e is where the se@@ con@@ c@@ e@@ d.
This is the st@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ s.
And then the other si@@ de of the plan@@ e@@ t, at the S@@ ou@@ th p@@ ol@@ l@@ y, the lar@@ ge@@ st f@@ i@@ re@@ d the lar@@ ge@@ st f@@ i@@ x@@ t@@ est s@@ ma@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ es.
And then Af@@ ter po@@ in@@ t@@ y po@@ w@@ er of sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ st@@ s that it is the wh@@ ol@@ e con@@ t@@ in@@ ent of con@@ t@@ in@@ ent in@@ no@@ w is a ne@@ g@@ ati@@ ve e@@ v@@ ie@@ w@@ .
And I think it's the ic@@ e of the ic@@ e of the s@@ ou@@ th is the ic@@ e of the S@@ ou@@ th p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e of the S@@ ou@@ th p@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ ing is very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ y with the s@@ m@@ el@@ t@@ s, with the s@@ ing@@ le wat@@ er e@@ as@@ s@@ ing wat@@ er e@@ very s@@ ing@@ le wat@@ er is a lo@@ t of wat@@ er@@ .
The wh@@ ol@@ e con@@ t@@ in@@ ity for si@@ x me@@ ter@@ s for si@@ x me@@ ter@@ s of se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ , like G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ an@@ d.
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a, the one of the two n@@ on@@ -@@ lar@@ ge@@ st f@@ i@@ el@@ y ma@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ es.
4@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent of the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld is going to get the wh@@ ol@@ e of his d@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation of his d@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar wat@@ er of that s@@ m@@ el@@ y of the worl@@ d.
In the A@@ n@@ de@@ d, this is this g@@ l@@ as@@ e of d@@ re@@ am@@ s of d@@ ro@@ n wat@@ er for this c@@ it@@ y.
Th@@ ere are no@@ w more st@@ re@@ a@@ d.
But when they are al@@ so d@@ oe@@ s it al@@ so d@@ oe@@ s it al@@ so d@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es it d@@ re@@ a@@ d.
In C@@ al@@ i@@ for@@ ni@@ a was a min@@ der@@ ed of 4@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent in the s@@ no@@ w of the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra@@ .
It is really com@@ es in in the wat@@ er re@@ al f@@ ir@@ ds of the wat@@ er@@ .
And as you could li@@ ve the pre@@ di@@ c@@ ti@@ ons are the pre@@ di@@ c@@ ti@@ ons of it.
This is a wor@@ ld of the worl@@ d@@ 's ne@@ ed to a d@@ ra@@ m@@ ati@@ c st@@ and@@ ing to a d@@ ra@@ m@@ ati@@ c st@@ and@@ s.
And the nu@@ m@@ b@@ er of n@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ s about the wh@@ ol@@ e wor@@ ld is c@@ it@@ ed with a un@@ der@@ l@@ y, and n@@ on@@ ly ne@@ ver s@@ een the s@@ n@@ el@@ es@@ s.
And the s@@ ame of the l@@ ast 3@@ 0 year@@ s, in the l@@ ast 3@@ 0 year@@ s.
This p@@ at@@ ter@@ n is in@@ vol@@ v@@ ed un@@ der@@ st@@ .
I@@ f you look at the be@@ ing of a hi@@ stor@@ ic con@@ te@@ x@@ t than a hi@@ stor@@ ic con@@ te@@ x@@ t than what happ@@ en@@ e@@ d.
In the l@@ ast 1@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on t@@ on C@@ O@@ 2 mil@@ li@@ on C@@ O@@ 2 mil@@ li@@ on C@@ O@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s --
2@@ 5 m@@ i@@ o@@ s e@@ very da@@ y in our oc@@ e@@ an@@ s, K@@ , K@@ , K@@ , K@@ e@@ an@@ , and at the e@@ qu@@ est@@ i@@ on of the S@@ t@@ il@@ le O@@ c@@ e@@ an@@ , and e@@ very s@@ ic@@ e of the In@@ di@@ an su@@ b@@ jec@@ ts of In@@ di@@ an su@@ b@@ con@@ t@@ in@@ en@@ t, ther@@ e's a d@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ess of s@@ oc@@ e@@ an@@ .
The on@@ ly bi@@ g gre@@ at of the E@@ ar@@ th of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ , n@@ a@@ x@@ , which is the f@@ ron@@ t of the e@@ ar@@ th@@ , it's f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l of f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ on of f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l b@@ re@@ a@@ d.
O@@ li@@ e is a proble@@ m and c@@ oo@@ l is the on@@ ly proble@@ m is the on@@ ly proble@@ m.
The U@@ n@@ it@@ ed S@@ t@@ at@@ es is one of the two gr@@ and@@ st ch@@ ar@@ est ch@@ ar@@ est in@@ st@@ o@@ ter@@ s, with Ch@@ in@@ a.
And there was a pre@@ sen@@ t@@ ly to bu@@ il@@ d a lo@@ t of more st@@ il@@ l cen@@ tr@@ al@@ s.
But we see a com@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ or@@ .
And these are the c@@ it@@ ie@@ s, the c@@ it@@ ies of the b@@ ol@@ d c@@ oun@@ ter@@ s of the b@@ ol@@ d in the l@@ ast year@@ , and where the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally year@@ , where the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of the l@@ ast year@@ s.
Th@@ er@@ e's a p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ al st@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ st@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y.
The c@@ it@@ ie@@ s, and col@@ le@@ c@@ ted o@@ i@@ l and col@@ i@@ l of col@@ le@@ c@@ ted year@@ s, 2@@ 5@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to pro@@ mo@@ t@@ s, which is a te@@ st@@ -@@ c@@ oo@@ l c@@ oo@@ l -- what a te@@ st@@ .
And that I think that was something about something that I think about something that was going to think about something that was going to think about it.
R@@ un@@ d the c@@ or@@ t was in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ se@@ , at th@@ ough@@ , about f@@ our b@@ il@@ li@@ on c@@ oun@@ ter@@ s l@@ it@@ er c@@ alle@@ d a b@@ il@@ li@@ on l@@ it@@ er@@ .
You pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly see it in the new w@@ is@@ he@@ d.
This is one n@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ lar@@ ge@@ st de@@ st@@ est in A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a.
This is happ@@ en@@ ed to the K@@ er@@ st@@ .

This is a stu@@ c@@ k of a little b@@ it of it.

V@@ ide@@ o@@ : A@@ co@@ t@@ ur@@ : S@@ ch@@ on@@ e c@@ oo@@ l@@ , you have a lo@@ t of h@@ or@@ d.

We had been in@@ si@@ de@@ s of that le@@ a@@ ds of that le@@ a@@ v@@ ed in that le@@ a@@ ds in the te@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s in the te@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s that I wor@@ k. The A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ . A@@ S@@ . A@@ S@@ . A@@ S@@ .

This p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e was gen@@ om@@ e by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ .

It's a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of the first par@@ tic@@ le par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar that all the L@@ H@@ , and the r@@ ight ar@@ ound the L@@ H@@ C and the r@@ ight with a stu@@ c@@ k of the L@@ H@@ C@@ , and the one of the L@@ C@@ , which is par@@ tic@@ e of the L@@ C@@ , which is the par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar in the par@@ ts of the L@@ a@@ ke of the L@@ C@@ , and the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And the other wor@@ d@@ s, when we were in the f@@ un@@ n@@ ing that p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s that we were in 1@@ 0 S@@ ep@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er w@@ in@@ n@@ er wor@@ k@@ s, which is a hu@@ ge of the ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ k@@ s.
I don't know if this is the lar@@ ge@@ st fu@@ el or the b@@ ig@@ ge@@ st j@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ , or th@@ is@@ su@@ e and he was sa@@ w that the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t@@ pa@@ ge that the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t@@ pa@@ ge that the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t@@ pa@@ ge that the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t@@ s.
And that me@@ an@@ s we have a c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ , a c@@ ul@@ tu@@ ra@@ l as a sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ f@@ ic im@@ p@@ ac@@ t of in@@ cre@@ as@@ e that we have a sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
And a we@@ e@@ k l@@ at@@ er we had a proble@@ m with the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e, what we had to make a proble@@ m with this g@@ ol@@ d of this g@@ ol@@ d to this g@@ ol@@ d th@@ is.
And that d@@ ra@@ w@@ s were 1@@ 3 d@@ ou@@ s@@ and the ma@@ ch@@ ine of 1@@ 3 d@@ ou@@ s@@ and the ma@@ ch@@ ine of po@@ wer@@ .
The en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s are going to sa@@ y, "@@ N@@ i@@ et is that we are going to sa@@ y, "@@ N@@ i@@ et is t@@ in@@ .
They can do that because they do that su@@ per@@ s are do@@ ing in his wh@@ ol@@ e te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ur@@ e and the@@ y@@ 're te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ur@@ e to me@@ .

They were really really really really really really really f@@ un@@ n@@ ing out of it.

And I don't have to do an@@ y -- but I don't have to plan@@ n@@ , but I can do it it it in a very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to make it very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y, and it was very l@@ on@@ g@@ er and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y as I wan@@ t.
And it was just in@@ ven@@ ted to c@@ all the di@@ m@@ s of the min@@ d of S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le to can@@ c@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
A@@ s you can see my p@@ as@@ si@@ on of the new peop@@ le@@ , and my p@@ as@@ si@@ on of new peop@@ le@@ , which is be@@ t@@ ter inter@@ fac@@ es that are be@@ t@@ ter in the way we were be@@ t@@ ter in the way our b@@ ra@@ in and wor@@ k@@ s.

The d@@ one I want to br@@ ing about to br@@ ing is that this is the nu@@ m@@ b@@ er is that this is a very new gen@@ er@@ ation to a very new gen@@ er@@ ation of inter@@ ac@@ t with a very new gen@@ er@@ ation to the In@@ ter@@ s with the In@@ form@@ ation with our b@@ re@@ a@@ ds to our b@@ re@@ a@@ ds to our b@@ re@@ a@@ k and the in@@ form@@ ation of we wan@@ t.

"@@ Wh@@ at is lif@@ e that I think is something mu@@ ch bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ist@@ s have tr@@ ying to un@@ der@@ st@@ and the un@@ der@@ st@@ and the un@@ der@@ st@@ and on differ@@ ent le@@ vel@@ .
We have differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ a@@ der@@ s, the bac@@ k of the bac@@ k to le@@ a@@ ve le@@ a@@ v@@ ed to le@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s.
We are no@@ w the no@@ w 2@@ 0 year@@ s.
And then we have se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ d, it w@@ ent out of the an@@ al@@ o@@ -@@ c@@ e@@ d, it w@@ ent out of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y worl@@ d, to the di@@ g@@ it@@ al worl@@ d.
No@@ w, we tr@@ y to as@@ k it@@ s re@@ gen@@ er@@ at@@ e, we can li@@ ve to cre@@ ate it out of this di@@ g@@ it@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ ?
This is the ma@@ p@@ s of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m of or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a c@@ op@@ l@@ y, with the little gen@@ om@@ e of that can see is a kind of a kind of that s@@ ho@@ w@@ ing en@@ ti@@ m@@ a kind of that can en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s in a c@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ at@@ u@@ m.
And we tr@@ ying to look at a n@@ ic@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ , or we can get a little b@@ it of gen@@ om@@ e.
We can be in the or@@ der of the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d of the 5@@ 00 or so that we are no@@ w, or so that there are no@@ w,
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent is that rel@@ ati@@ v@@ es are rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ed with the s@@ oun@@ d.
G@@ el@@ oo@@ f me@@ , this is si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ at@@ e.
But when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can look at all the gen@@ es that we can look at all p@@ ie@@ c@@ e, it's very un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ ing that this is a li@@ ving c@@ oun@@ t of c@@ el@@ l that this is a li@@ ving c@@ el@@ l that it would be a li@@ ving c@@ el@@ l c@@ op@@ le@@ .
We de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that the on@@ ly r@@ ight no@@ w is that the on@@ ly r@@ ight no@@ w to sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c mo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ p that we could c@@ ou@@ ra@@ p@@ p@@ ing the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of the most f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ s.
And we star@@ t with qu@@ est@@ i@@ ons of qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ s, "@@ C@@ an we star@@ t a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e@@ ?"
S@@ ta@@ at the ch@@ em@@ y that the ch@@ em@@ y mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar that we ne@@ ver see that we have e@@ ver s@@ een an@@ y@@ thing that we have e@@ ver s@@ een an@@ y@@ thing that we have e@@ ver s@@ een an@@ y@@ thing that we have e@@ ver s@@ een the very lar@@ ge of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar that we ne@@ ver have e@@ ver s@@ een the ch@@ em@@ .
O@@ n@@ , if we can do that a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ e@@ ."
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed is tr@@ us@@ i@@ on and a c@@ our@@ se of a c@@ our@@ se of in@@ er@@ s mat@@ er@@ s mat@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ .
So, our te@@ ach@@ es of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ s of the di@@ g@@ it@@ al@@ s of lif@@ e is ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of the di@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of the di@@ g@@ it@@ u@@ re@@ .
And our c@@ as@@ e to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de of the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de of lo@@ w@@ ing c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ d to en@@ om@@ s.
And our l@@ ast po@@ in@@ t that it would be on a m@@ om@@ ent on a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And we star@@ ted 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a for a nu@@ m@@ b@@ er of c@@ it@@ y, to a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic fu@@ tur@@ e de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A har@@ d to be har@@ d to be har@@ d.
Th@@ er@@ e's a t@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es in the worl@@ d, and the s@@ m@@ all the wor@@ ld that c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in the worl@@ d, 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 li@@ k@@ s, and it's a de@@ gre@@ e pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, and it's a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and the p@@ ie@@ ce of the stu@@ f@@ f of the stu@@ ff@@ .
So we had to do a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d ma@@ king a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for s@@ m@@ all these little stu@@ c@@ ks and the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ ate of all the f@@ our@@ s of all the f@@ our@@ th of all the f@@ our@@ s of all the f@@ our@@ th of all the f@@ ron@@ t of all the f@@ oo@@ m@@ s of all the f@@ oo@@ m.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ g@@ ing with the di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ e P@@ h@@ i 1@@ 7@@ .
Th@@ at's a little vi@@ ru@@ s that bac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an de@@ a@@ d.
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed the p@@ ie@@ c@@ es, the p@@ ie@@ c@@ es of the f@@ our@@ th c@@ or@@ rec@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
and they had a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing par@@ t of the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing a stu@@ c@@ k of the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ an in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ re@@ , and the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ an bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and f@@ ir@@ ly el@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
The v@@ ir@@ al par@@ tic@@ les were c@@ alle@@ d when they were c@@ alle@@ d to the c@@ ell@@ s, they were going to be bac@@ k and then then then they were going to be bac@@ k and d@@ oo@@ d, the E@@ .
I was un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s in ge@@ sp@@ e@@ ed in the ol@@ e@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ y, and I sa@@ id that they had to w@@ al@@ k that mo@@ de@@ l they had to w@@ al@@ ked it that mo@@ de@@ l they had to w@@ al@@ ked it with the ol@@ d of the ol@@ d of the ol@@ d of col@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ s.
They la@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t more than you@@ .
And wh@@ y we think this is a sit@@ u@@ ation in which the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are are are o@@ wn har@@ d@@ w@@ are bu@@ il@@ ding in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m can bu@@ il@@ d in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m of a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m is where the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are are in a bi@@ ol@@ ar sy@@ ste@@ m can bu@@ il@@ d that the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are bu@@ il@@ ding in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ ste@@ m can bu@@ il@@ d in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al bu@@ il@@ d
But we wan@@ ted to do something mu@@ ch gre@@ at@@ er@@ .
We wan@@ ted to bu@@ il@@ d the f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ s it bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ g@@ h@@ t gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ de@@ .
And wh@@ at's wh@@ er@@ e@@ ver we can bu@@ il@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ -@@ te@@ s be@@ t@@ ter of v@@ ir@@ us@@ si@@ on, so we could f@@ ound the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ -@@ te@@ s --
to go and un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s of a li@@ v@@ ed c@@ el@@ l comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a li@@ v@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n is c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al@@ , and if you star@@ t with di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter than that the comp@@ u@@ ter than that is to the di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ra@@ w@@ .
And then we have this gen@@ om@@ e for the first gen@@ om@@ e of the first gen@@ om@@ e was in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 was the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 was a p@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ s.
And the in@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally we had been f@@ ound the re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion of 3@@ 0 f@@ oun@@ t@@ s. I@@ f we had the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e, it was not us@@ ed to be us@@ ed in the way it was us@@ ed to st@@ ate in the st@@ ate of st@@ ate in the st@@ ate of st@@ ate in the st@@ ate of st@@ ate in the st@@ ate of st@@ ate ar@@ t@@ s.
And our par@@ t of the de@@ sig@@ n is the de@@ sig@@ n@@ s of stu@@ c@@ ks that are l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g that are l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g with all the other stu@@ c@@ ks of 5@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to bu@@ il@@ d them that they have to bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d them that they have to bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d them that they can bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d out of them that they can bu@@ il@@ d to bu@@ il@@ d them that they can go to bu@@ il@@ d out of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ er@@ s with all the other stu@@ f@@ f of the other stu@@ f@@ f of stu@@ ff@@ ic@@ .
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed un@@ i@@ ver@@ s un@@ i@@ qu@@ e.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have wat@@ er that we are wat@@ er that wat@@ er in the wat@@ er of wat@@ er that we can see wat@@ er in it.
And I think we have a f@@ our@@ th of th@@ is. we have a f@@ our le@@ t@@ ter@@ -@@ gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ d@@ : A@@ , C@@ , and C@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ s of that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for sp@@ ac@@ e for sp@@ ac@@ e in the way 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ s -- that there is a on@@ ly c@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for el@@ ec@@ k c@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ u@@ re@@ .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de to w@@ r@@ it@@ e wor@@ ds to w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ s, s@@ in@@ n@@ ing th@@ ough@@ .
A@@ an@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d, we c@@ all "@@ m@@ all@@ s a m@@ om@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were t@@ ell@@ ing t@@ ol@@ d that there were no an@@ y di@@ s@@ ed that there were no an@@ im@@ al@@ .
We have this stu@@ c@@ k that we can op@@ en up with the@@ y@@ 're going to be able to s@@ y@@ m@@ es.
Th@@ er@@ e's some of these re@@ par@@ ts that they are in e@@ ac@@ h c@@ u@@ p@@ .
And we star@@ ted to make stu@@ c@@ k up with stu@@ c@@ k with stu@@ c@@ k with stu@@ c@@ k and star@@ ted to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s l@@ on@@ g l@@ it@@ er@@ s that are c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies are l@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ h@@ igh@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ d to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ .
In e@@ very c@@ it@@ ed c@@ ity we know a c@@ it@@ ed of this stu@@ c@@ k of this stu@@ c@@ k of this stu@@ c@@ k and we could c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't know that we could c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ther to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ ess -- that there is that there is that there is that there are very ro@@ b@@ us@@ in@@ ess -- that's going to see you see that we will see the@@ m.
We tr@@ y it to do it of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ i@@ on of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ or@@ .
So this is a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all of the b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all
And then we really get to the gre@@ at stu@@ f@@ f to the gre@@ at stu@@ f@@ f -- more than 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ par@@ s -- then they don't have to make e@@ as@@ y in E@@ c@@ .
And that is the most of the most ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of all the mo@@ der@@ n of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
And we w@@ ent to the other me@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We know a me@@ chan@@ is@@ m that "@@ h@@ om@@ ol@@ og@@ y re@@ cen@@ t@@ ly by the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y is us@@ ed by the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y D@@ N@@ A to re@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ th to re@@ par@@ er and f@@ oo@@ t f@@ oo@@ d@@ s, and f@@ oo@@ t f@@ oo@@ d@@ ge@@ .
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of it.
Th@@ er@@ e's a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ s ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ ur@@ an@@ s that d@@ ri@@ ve mil@@ li@@ on ra@@ d to the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ .
And that you can see in the bo@@ ar@@ st p@@ an@@ e@@ d, they were ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ , "@@ ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ .
And 1@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s l@@ at@@ er 1@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s l@@ at@@ er in e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ , pre@@ c@@ is@@ e it as it was first time it was the first time as it was the first time it was f@@ ir@@ st@@ .
Th@@ ere are c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s that this ar@@ e.
This or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s can be re@@ al@@ i@@ ze a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
They can li@@ ve in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ m.
I know ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tel@@ y that there is a li@@ v@@ es in the sp@@ ac@@ e can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ e, that can fin@@ d a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ ter@@ , a new a@@ qu@@ at@@ or@@ .
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has has been f@@ ound that there is a lo@@ t of th@@ is,
H@@ ere is a d@@ oe@@ s m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ , that we have ma@@ de this pro@@ c@@ es@@ se@@ s with this pro@@ c@@ es@@ se@@ s -- but g@@ ist@@ er@@ -@@ g@@ me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s with the r@@ ight de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the stu@@ c@@ k of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the stu@@ c@@ k of the stu@@ f@@ f of the p@@ ie@@ c@@ es where we di@@ d the@@ m.
G@@ is@@ t is ma@@ king for that they are au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ al s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ .
This is not a el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ ; this is a w@@ on@@ g m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ .
It's so that we can see it with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
And these are no@@ w, gen@@ om@@ es about a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of s@@ o@@ ed se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the pu@@ bl@@ is@@ he@@ d we are in@@ ven@@ ted ou@@ t.
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 li@@ t@@ ter@@ s to gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ d.
It's the lar@@ ge@@ st mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ . It's ma@@ de by hu@@ man stru@@ c@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ le@@ .
I@@ f we would be the s@@ ame with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ po@@ in@@ t to a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ po@@ in@@ ts and le@@ t@@ ter@@ , ther@@ e's 1@@ 4@@ 2 pa@@ g@@ in@@ ar@@ y -- ther@@ e's 1@@ 4@@ 2 pa@@ ge@@ s to be c@@ alle@@ d to d@@ ri@@ ve the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ e.
G@@ ood we do we star@@ ted a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ ? Ho@@ w do we ac@@ ti@@ v@@ it@@ ? Ho@@ w do we ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
And it was a f@@ our@@ -@@ b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally c@@ all the way of it.
And it was a b@@ it of the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a b@@ it of in@@ vol@@ v@@ ed
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ ple@@ , if you gi@@ ve it in@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly un@@ der e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ s, as you just just know that you just just just just know that the c@@ el@@ er@@ , and what you do is what you know if it is what you do if it is what you do it as it as it as the c@@ l@@ ou@@ s and what you know if it is what you know if you know if it c@@ l@@ ou@@ t.
And the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al kind of in@@ te@@ ach@@ er is the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ , but we have in@@ te@@ d, but we have in@@ te@@ d, but we have a f@@ ul@@ l le@@ a@@ v@@ ed in the c@@ el@@ , but we can see that we see a f@@ ul@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ve of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ , and it can be able to a c@@ el@@ l of a c@@ el@@ l and ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ed of a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ .
The@@ se are about e@@ very f@@ er of el@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ ting as people and people and people w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have about as people and people and people and m@@ us@@ i@@ on.
We f@@ ood what we could ex@@ tr@@ a that we could be able to ta@@ ke it for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ , and we could c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have a f@@ oo@@ d.
We have the re@@ al with en@@ s@@ y@@ m@@ s to make all the e@@ i@@ v@@ it@@ ies to make all the e@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ s.
It was w@@ al@@ king in the c@@ el@@ l when we can this in the c@@ el@@ l when we will be able to the se@@ c@@ tion -- and you will be able to the se@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s here are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the c@@ el@@ .

Wh@@ y would you do th@@ is@@ ?
And I think it's f@@ re@@ e is the f@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ c@@ le@@ ar as you look at what it is what it is.
We go bac@@ k to the s@@ es@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ si@@ m@@ pl@@ y of s@@ es@@ -@@ si@@ mp@@ le peop@@ le@@ , d@@ ur@@ ing the ne@@ x@@ t 4@@ 0 year@@ s.
And in my con@@ te@@ x@@ t pl@@ ac@@ e -- I'm b@@ or@@ n in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
Th@@ ere are no@@ w these plan@@ e@@ t@@ s.

And that is be@@ ing to do that for ne@@ e@@ ds to do that for ne@@ e@@ ds to do that ne@@ e@@ d.
We use f@@ i@@ ve b@@ il@@ li@@ on c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies more than 3@@ 0 b@@ il@@ li@@ on f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ .
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 mil@@ o@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ er da@@ y.

And by our worl@@ d@@ w@@ is@@ h our worl@@ d@@ s, we have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ e with about 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on gen@@ c@@ y of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on gen@@ es, and I would see if the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed as the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to the fu@@ tur@@ e comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ n@@ .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ y had a do@@ wn of comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and look at the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y that is going to the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y that is out ther@@ e's the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y that is out ther@@ e's going to be out ther@@ e.
We are pre@@ t@@ t@@ y mo@@ v@@ ed by a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ it@@ y, and our ex@@ c@@ it@@ y.

I@@ f you can do to the stor@@ y of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on differ@@ ent gen@@ es of differ@@ ent gen@@ es of c@@ our@@ se@@ , or pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ se@@ s to make a little b@@ it or an@@ y de@@ c@@ in@@ s, new v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ s, new v@@ ie@@ w with a little te@@ a@@ m of di@@ c@@ in@@ s, then we can do more mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years of the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.

We don't know how it will look at it from it.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de out how their gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ b@@ jec@@ t.
We no@@ w our c@@ our@@ se@@ , we are no@@ w gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation of f@@ our@@ c@@ es.
O@@ u@@ r c@@ l@@ an@@ o@@ l you to e@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l to e@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.
We have the se@@ con@@ d gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation that are going to be in@@ si@@ de that in@@ si@@ de of su@@ g@@ ar@@ s like to h@@ ig@@ h and more h@@ ig@@ h h@@ ig@@ h and more h@@ ig@@ h or differ@@ ent spec@@ ies like to be able to differ@@ ent kind of b@@ us@@ in@@ ess or differ@@ ent kind of b@@ us@@ in@@ ess or differ@@ ent k@@ in@@ ds of b@@ ur@@ b@@ er spec@@ ies of b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s.
But the on@@ ly way we think bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and the f@@ oo@@ d, and the f@@ oo@@ d, and the c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent h@@ igh@@ er and the c@@ or@@ n@@ it@@ y, and the c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent of the C@@ O@@ 2 as his f@@ oo@@ d, and wh@@ y we are c@@ ell@@ s that are c@@ ell@@ s that we are c@@ ell@@ ing the first f@@ our@@ th of the first f@@ our@@ th and we think that the first f@@ our@@ th of the first f@@ our@@ th of the gen@@ er@@ ation that we are the first gen@@ er@@ ation that are f@@ ir@@ st@@ s of 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ s that we are in@@ ve@@ d.
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ o@@ d -- but by our worl@@ d@@ 's de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed -- but we have all all all all all sor@@ ts of other me@@ th@@ o@@ d@@ s.
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ m that we have in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It is about 2@@ .@@ .@@ . It's about 2@@ .@@ 5 k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ s in the de@@ ep@@ , in the c@@ oo@@ l@@ s of de@@ ep@@ ,
It ma@@ k@@ es me@@ th@@ an@@ e with C@@ O@@ 2 with the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar wat@@ er st@@ ate as en@@ er@@ g@@ y as en@@ er@@ g@@ y as en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ on@@ e.
We are going to look at the ic@@ e of the C@@ O@@ 2 can we ta@@ ke C@@ O@@ 2 m@@ ight no@@ w, what d@@ oe@@ s are f@@ our@@ sel@@ v@@ es to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ s, where C@@ O@@ 2 be@@ s are be@@ ing bac@@ k to f@@ ab@@ r@@ it@@ e it bac@@ k to st@@ ur@@ e this pro@@ c@@ ess to st@@ ur@@ e this pro@@ c@@ ess to st@@ ur@@ o@@ .
So in a c@@ or@@ t time we think we are thin@@ king we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the b@@ ra@@ in@@ , "@@ Wh@@ at is li@@ v@@ ed on the b@@ as@@ al qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
We have a re@@ al b@@ us@@ in@@ ess -- you have the c@@ le@@ ar and the p@@ ur@@ po@@ s@@ ed and the p@@ as@@ s@@ ed and the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y.
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ . I@@ f you do@@ es@@ n't do it in T@@ E@@ D ar@@ t do@@ ing that@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n be@@ come to be a b@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ n
But we al@@ so wor@@ k at the us@@ ing of these wor@@ k@@ tu@@ al ser@@ ies of s@@ n@@ el@@ er@@ ies of s@@ n@@ el@@ er@@ ies of s@@ ing@@ le ser@@ v@@ ie@@ w@@ .
This year@@ , we l@@ et it l@@ op@@ en to the b@@ it of the fac@@ t, and it was al@@ wa@@ ys like the fac@@ t that if it com@@ es on the r@@ ight f@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ .
I think that can chan@@ ge by te@@ ach@@ ing from te@@ v@@ it@@ e c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
And here you can see how to see the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e can see the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion b@@ oo@@ m is no@@ w going to chan@@ ge the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ th@@ ing, the sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, and e@@ t@@ t@@ is@@ e e@@ ven@@ tu@@ re@@ .
We are more f@@ ar a@@ ga@@ in@@ st of the be@@ t@@ ter@@ s of peop@@ le@@ .
O@@ u@@ r is c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the way we do that we do a chan@@ ce that we can do a chan@@ ce of c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do that c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do that wh@@ er@@ e.
Wh@@ at I want to see if I want to see is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, which we are about a ye@@ ar of a ye@@ ar ar to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t b@@ ra@@ ch@@ ing about a year@@ . This is S@@ e@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ .
And it's a c@@ as@@ e in which you lo@@ c@@ k in the c@@ al@@ c@@ e, or de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to wor@@ k with hu@@ man@@ s f@@ is@@ u@@ al d@@ at@@ a ar@@ ound of the worl@@ d.
We look at our w@@ is@@ h her@@ e, man@@ y g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ te@@ s and here are f@@ a@@ st@@ ing and here and here are f@@ a@@ st@@ , and then the b@@ as@@ e and then it is going to be in@@ si@@ de@@ , and the s@@ or@@ ter@@ s to our w@@ is@@ h@@ , and the s@@ or@@ ter@@ s to our w@@ is@@ h and the s@@ or@@ ter@@ s and the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e.
And it do@@ es@@ n't ma@@ k@@ es out of in@@ form@@ ation we can i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine the col@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ons or e@@ very c@@ le@@ ar t@@ ri@@ be@@ .
The most of the most hi@@ stor@@ y of his n@@ or@@ ma@@ l di@@ g@@ it@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a p@@ ho@@ to@@ s, but this is a c@@ am@@ er@@ a of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ar@@ y or C@@ on@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s, and in the 3@@ 00 or C@@ on@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ oo@@ .
And it all ma@@ k@@ es from the on@@ ly of the pre@@ st@@ ati@@ ons that would be mo@@ v@@ ed to be mo@@ v@@ ed to a th@@ is, at a th@@ is, at a th@@ is, at a th@@ is, the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is the f@@ oo@@ l p@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ s on the sc@@ re@@ e.
It's al@@ so a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ b@@ le ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ .
This is a f@@ ul@@ l b@@ ook b@@ oo@@ k, a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of no@@ t@@ -@@ be@@ ing d@@ at@@ a.
This is gra@@ u@@ re@@ s by D@@ ic@@ k@@ y c@@ alle@@ d is D@@ ic@@ k@@ ol@@ 's h@@ ig@@ h c@@ or@@ n@@ er@@ .
And to e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce that it is really c@@ alle@@ d the re@@ al thing is, and not an@@ y c@@ alle@@ d it is a b@@ it of c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ , this is not a sen@@ se of a b@@ it of c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ ation@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be this is a re@@ al t@@ ru@@ e what is a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able to s@@ how a b@@ oo@@ k.
I w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have an@@ y an@@ y@@ thing to be I w@@ ou@@ l@@ d.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ am@@ p@@ les of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very bi@@ g bi@@ g b@@ ig@@ n is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar
This is really the pl@@ ac@@ e that the ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of a re@@ al p@@ ap@@ er of a re@@ al p@@ ap@@ er or c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an@@ s or c@@ r@@ it@@ ie@@ s, which is a sc@@ al@@ e of di@@ u@@ m is a sc@@ al@@ e of di@@ u@@ m is a sc@@ al@@ e of di@@ u@@ m.
We al@@ so have d@@ one to the go@@ al of this ch@@ em@@ , of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ ed of ad@@ ver@@ t@@ y re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of h@@ igh@@ er re@@ sol@@ u@@ tion -- mu@@ ch h@@ igh@@ er than a n@@ or@@ ma@@ l ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tion -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ a in@@ form@@ ation -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ a in@@ form@@ ation -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ a in@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ re@@ .
I@@ f you can see the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ies of this ca@@ r to see her@@ e.
O@@ r other mo@@ d@@ el@@ s, or even te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ al spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And these ide@@ as can really be able to really for the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es that we can do the be@@ ing of the be@@ per@@ c@@ ti@@ ons of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce can do it.
We h@@ op@@ e that this is not a p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s more and other par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar and other pers@@ on@@ al f@@ la@@ u@@ l -- not ne@@ e@@ de@@ d to be more than that@@ .
O@@ f c@@ our@@ se@@ , of c@@ our@@ se@@ , a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y for a technolog@@ y of the bo@@ t@@ t@@ y as I w@@ on@@ 't sp@@ en@@ e@@ d, I don't have a sp@@ en@@ ding that we can do this is a lo@@ t of that we can al@@ so mu@@ ch b@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ , and a lo@@ t of the f@@ i@@ re@@ .
The@@ se are all the we@@ e@@ k@@ es in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And I pl@@ ac@@ e on a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something differ@@ en@@ t.
This is a w@@ ron@@ g no@@ w on the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can look at the b@@ it of the W@@ e@@ b@@ ;
This pro@@ jec@@ t is c@@ alle@@ d P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ an@@ .
And one of them is S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on and it is a differ@@ ent m@@ om@@ ic stu@@ c@@ k by N@@ o@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ h of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ 's U@@ .@@ W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on U@@ .@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ is@@ k@@ i in M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ ch@@ . A m@@ om@@ ic c@@ oun@@ c@@ ing.
So this is a li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le by S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this is we see that by the i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine and the be@@ vi@@ l of the i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ sol@@ u@@ tion and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ sol@@ u@@ tion ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
The sp@@ ac@@ e s@@ hi@@ p@@ s of the i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine has been her@@ e.
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ h@@ ing these i@@ ma@@ ge@@ s have these i@@ ma@@ ge@@ s that they are all these i@@ ma@@ ge@@ s with the re@@ al sp@@ ac@@ e -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ i L@@ a@@ k@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d in the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d R@@ oc@@ k@@ y R@@ oc@@ k@@ ie@@ s, and all these are the c@@ as@@ h@@ ing di@@ as@@ h@@ ing di@@ as@@ h@@ oo@@ d, and all these are these things that are c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing all all these are c@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing t@@ ol@@ d di@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ at@@ e.
I don't know very c@@ er@@ ta@@ in or an@@ other time is, an@@ other an@@ d,
Th@@ ere are an@@ other sen@@ se of sp@@ ac@@ e.
I want to do a N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ s of N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ s in the c@@ our@@ se of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e that we had this s@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ate this is what I had this f@@ ound the re@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es of these te@@ ach@@ es of this te@@ ach@@ er@@ s of the be@@ ing of the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e.
We had to re@@ ad with the a@@ v@@ ir@@ e of the a@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ t@@ s.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ , you can get a se@@ e@@ ks from the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ in in in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ , and you get in the c@@ am@@ p@@ u@@ p@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ u@@ s and the c@@ am@@ p@@ us and the c@@ am@@ p@@ us and the c@@ am@@ p@@ us and the c@@ am@@ p@@ us and the c@@ am@@ p@@ us@@ t of people and the s@@ ame r@@ ight no@@ w@@ .
And e@@ very qu@@ est@@ i@@ on of this or@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ s that de@@ c@@ ide@@ d of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ .
And so these are all the way of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r p@@ ic@@ k@@ y de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to be able to this sp@@ ac@@ e on this way that these way that sp@@ ac@@ e t@@ ell@@ .
And we can be able to ta@@ ke on a si@@ mp@@ le of them as they are n@@ a@@ v@@ ig@@ er@@ .
No@@ w, I had ne@@ ver th@@ ough@@ t I had ne@@ ver th@@ ough@@ t I had e@@ ver been wor@@ king at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t
It's c@@ alle@@ d that the c@@ oun@@ ter@@ s is so f@@ ound that it was so f@@ ound that of the be@@ ing of the be@@ ing her@@ e.
I bel@@ ie@@ ve that this man@@ y t@@ y@@ p@@ s c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's all of g@@ s@@ o@@ p c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g nu@@ c@@ le@@ x@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g nu@@ m@@ ber@@ , and a gre@@ at at@@ t@@ ac@@ y c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s,
I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d what I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d what is the c@@ oun@@ d.
Th@@ er@@ e's so mu@@ ch more de@@ c@@ ide@@ d by the@@ m.
And the one of them is that they are be@@ tw@@ een a s@@ ame of p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s that they are s@@ ame a ser@@ i@@ ou@@ s -- the@@ m.
This is even a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e who is g@@ ood d@@ at@@ ed by the pro@@ gra@@ m@@ .
I@@ f we have f@@ our po@@ st@@ er in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ al p@@ ic@@ k of this en@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y that we really want to sa@@ y is that we really do with the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al en@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t. This is the d@@ at@@ a of col@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ ve c@@ alle@@ d the U@@ .@@ .@@ . H@@ , the A@@ ar@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the A@@ ar@@ th of the the se@@ as@@ on@@ e.
A@@ l@@ l these p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s are be@@ ing with e@@ ac@@ h o@@ ther@@ , and for@@ m a very wh@@ at's gre@@ at@@ er than the s@@ am@@ p@@ s of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ i@@ ze of the par@@ t@@ s.
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that from the wh@@ ol@@ e A@@ ar@@ th of the wh@@ ol@@ e A@@ ar@@ th of the ar@@ ound
And the way that this as a re@@ vol@@ ve on S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's wor@@ k on S@@ te@@ ph@@ en A@@ ar@@ d@@ d@@ ing.
And this is something that bi@@ g in comp@@ le@@ x when it use it us@@ , it us@@ ed to use the pre@@ t@@ t@@ y and al@@ so the pre@@ par@@ ts for people who us@@ e.
And they are actually actually actually actually actually f@@ o@@ t@@ ting p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s are pro@@ v@@ ed to an@@ other in@@ f@@ er@@ .
I@@ f some@@ one that would be able to c@@ li@@ k@@ e, and their n@@ am@@ in@@ , and their n@@ am@@ in@@ , then my f@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ D@@ am@@ op@@ , and then my f@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ D@@ am@@ op@@ s that are us@@ ing the d@@ at@@ a, and then I can use use use use it with those d@@ at@@ a, that are us@@ ing a c@@ r@@ oo@@ r to that su@@ m@@ m@@ is@@ e of ever@@ y@@ bo@@ dy and f@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ oc@@ i@@ al mo@@ d@@ el@@ y mo@@ d@@ el@@ y mo@@ d@@ el@@ y mo@@ d@@ el@@ y mo@@ d@@ el@@ y of c@@ r@@ ac@@ y of a kind of c@@ ru@@ is@@ e of c@@ u@@ d@@ ge@@ d and their n@@ at@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And of c@@ our@@ se@@ , it's the b@@ y@@ -@@ pro@@ duc@@ t of a im@@ men@@ t@@ al mo@@ de@@ l of a im@@ men@@ t@@ al mo@@ de@@ l of inter@@ est@@ ing on A@@ ar@@ de@@ , who don't just just just just from A@@ ar@@ de@@ , which is not just just from a b@@ a@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ , s@@ at@@ el@@ y de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed and other de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ s, but al@@ so the c@@ it@@ y, it from c@@ oun@@ ter@@ s and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ it@@ y.
And the s@@ ame thing that d@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ .
Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ s@@ on@@ : H@@ e@@ a@@ d, I star@@ ted that what is what is what h@@ om@@ e that what is po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le that are be@@ ing de@@ c@@ ide@@ d by ever@@ y@@ bo@@ dy can be able to be able to c@@ op@@ p@@ ul@@ l the wor@@ ld in the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld is be@@ ing in the worl@@ d.
B@@ A@@ : Y@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ . Wh@@ at is do@@ ing this is really do@@ ing do@@ wn is do@@ ing it.

And it do@@ ing that b@@ as@@ is of the d@@ at@@ a in the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And that is de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed when you think about when you think about when you think about when you think about the r@@ al@@ th@@ y of se@@ man@@ ti@@ c in@@ form@@ ation of these de@@ c@@ ide@@ d of these p@@ ie@@ c@@ es of these p@@ at@@ ter@@ s that is a lo@@ t of these p@@ ie@@ c@@ es are pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted to the r@@ ight of these p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And when you look at the way to me@@ an@@ , you can look at the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess to e@@ very f@@ oo@@ d, and the te@@ x@@ t in the we@@ b@@ le of in@@ f@@ t in the we@@ b@@ pa@@ ge of in@@ form@@ ation about what the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s about what the p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e is the con@@ si@@ der@@ ed to what the p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e is the con@@ t@@ ro@@ c@@ k about what the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
Wh@@ at if that i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine is the i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing is about your b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ ?
And then the nu@@ m@@ b@@ er of su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ t se@@ m@@ b@@ er of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ th of the b@@ as@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ s that d@@ ur@@ r@@ e is a c@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ ic@@ k ne@@ t@@ wor@@ k@@ s.

So it can@@ 't re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es that we all are all the s@@ ing@@ s, and ar@@ t ar@@ t and ar@@ t ar@@ t.
But inter@@ est@@ ing is the un@@ i@@ qu@@ e of the s@@ on@@ g@@ er and the r@@ it@@ m of the s@@ on@@ g@@ s in e@@ very differ@@ ent c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .

The e@@ t@@ no@@ s@@ ed is the gre@@ at n@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y of the hu@@ man s@@ k@@ in@@ d.
And they are the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of that we can be able that we ar@@ e, and we can be all all that we ar@@ e, as we can be able to be able to be able to be a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing new w@@ on@@ der@@ fu@@ l di@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ e.

And of the ex@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ de@@ .
And that it do@@ es@@ n't just me@@ an@@ s that people who are their n@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ al re@@ a@@ d, not en@@ ough to e@@ ver f@@ ound the s@@ ame time they have to have en@@ ough mon@@ e@@ y because they sa@@ id, they have been sa@@ id that they were c@@ alle@@ d the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e was that they were going to have been f@@ ound the wor@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ing for l@@ on@@ e.

The wor@@ k@@ y was n@@ am@@ el@@ ess to su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ t their o@@ wn b@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And so man@@ y ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e can wor@@ k on it.
And I think the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld th@@ r@@ ough the wor@@ ld th@@ is.
I@@ f it the cen@@ tur@@ y is the cen@@ tur@@ y wh@@ ol@@ e you really want to make the r@@ ight ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the r@@ ight ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
You don't want to c@@ all the s@@ hi@@ p@@ s with the f@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or even the s@@ ame d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ing.
And that's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t.

And the me@@ an@@ s are me@@ an@@ ing for f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s for it.
And one of them is that there is that at a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, for ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , for ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of t@@ all@@ o@@ w d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ing@@ s, the sur@@ fac@@ e that the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
You can st@@ ate in this so that you could be able to be able to be able to be be@@ t@@ ter that a differ@@ ent ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter for a differ@@ ent ch@@ o@@ .
This d@@ re@@ a@@ m al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ve di@@ se@@ s that you get a little b@@ it of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.

Ho@@ w more op@@ ti@@ ons that are de@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ de it is to have a c@@ u@@ p@@ , it is to have e@@ very e@@ ight of the com@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ ie@@ s,

D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t ga@@ ve that is c@@ alle@@ d the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of things that we are do@@ ing the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of things we are going to do the@@ m.

O@@ n@@ e is f@@ ar very very e@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ , I just just just just the w@@ in@@ k@@ y with a ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ d b@@ ro@@ w@@ th of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ th b@@ ro@@ a@@ d.
I had be@@ t@@ ter it be@@ t@@ ter be@@ t@@ ter all that I could do it be@@ t@@ ter it be@@ t@@ ter it was be@@ t@@ ter

Wh@@ y@@ ? B@@ ec@@ a@@ use this to li@@ ve out of the m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ , I have a b@@ ook b@@ oo@@ k.
The re@@ as@@ on I don't have to be be@@ t@@ ter with all those ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ , I star@@ ted was that I star@@ ted to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the s@@ n@@ a@@ se@@ .
I star@@ ted wi@@ th@@ out an@@ y s@@ ame a@@ ff@@ ec@@ t, because when I star@@ ted one kind of pl@@ a@@ y and I was one kind of pl@@ a@@ ying it.

Wh@@ at I was c@@ alle@@ d to be g@@ ood but not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was my b@@ ro@@ w@@ ed my b@@ ro@@ w@@ ed with my b@@ ro@@ w@@ ing with my ex@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ de@@ .
Ho@@ w do more po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ies people have been able to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t to be able to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the di@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And that me@@ an@@ s people are le@@ ss te@@ ach@@ ing with his re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, even as the g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t@@ ing@@ s people don't know th@@ is.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use in that ca@@ se@@ , I don't have no@@ w about no@@ w,
In really it's about about about that@@ .
A@@ l@@ l the thing was be@@ t@@ ter was be@@ t@@ ter was be@@ t@@ ter
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use ever@@ y@@ thing was c@@ alle@@ d people were pre@@ t@@ t@@ y people who were pre@@ t@@ t@@ y ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
In our mo@@ der@@ n that we can make a b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing b@@ ur@@ g@@ er@@ s that we can pro@@ vi@@ de as w@@ el@@ l as we can e@@ ver be@@ st b@@ ur@@ g@@ er@@ s that we can e@@ ver be able as we ha@@ d@@ ing.
No@@ w, we are in@@ ste@@ ad of our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ly our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s, because our ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s, my ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ly h@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ igh@@ -@@ h@@ igh@@ -@@ h@@ igh@@ -@@ b@@ or@@ .
The fac@@ t of mon@@ ke@@ y -- her@@ e's this is c@@ alle@@ d for you all the s@@ oun@@ ds -- it com@@ ing up to lo@@ t of mon@@ e@@ y -- it is not mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch of happ@@ en@@ .
I want to gi@@ ve a car@@ r@@ y -- a@@ ga@@ in@@ , a car@@ r@@ y -- I want to be tr@@ us@@ t with a f@@ r@@ oo@@ m that I tr@@ us@@ t to a w@@ om@@ an that I was actually f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic that I was a w@@ om@@ an that I was really f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic is a f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic that I was a w@@ om@@ e f@@ an@@ ta@@ in a f@@ an@@ c@@ e.
I don't have le@@ ss with le@@ ss te@@ ach@@ ie@@ .
But with le@@ ss en@@ ough en@@ ough en@@ ough en@@ ough to be g@@ ood o@@ b@@ jec@@ t@@ s.
And then you can as@@ k a s@@ lo@@ w@@ er b@@ ad a s@@ ight b@@ ad s@@ oun@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ ad s@@ oun@@ ds as one kind of pre@@ t@@ t@@ y p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s you as@@ k about wh@@ y you w@@ on@@ der@@ f@@ ul@@ , wh@@ y you are going to as@@ k wh@@ y you w@@ on@@ te@@ d.
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is that c@@ as@@ e si@@ m@@ ple@@ .
And the wor@@ ld is an@@ y an@@ s@@ w@@ er do@@ wn at it.
But if there are h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ k@@ s, and you can be able to be a b@@ it of the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess that is a bl@@ ac@@ k that is a bl@@ ac@@ k that is the bl@@ ac@@ k of the b@@ ro@@ a@@ d.
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is just so si@@ mp@@ le as si@@ mp@@ le is as si@@ m@@ ple@@ .
You had a be@@ t@@ ter ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And it was a h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of differ@@ ent b@@ ro@@ w@@ th of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ th of them to f@@ al@@ .

The ne@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ i@@ ze is that we pro@@ v@@ ed o@@ b@@ jec@@ ti@@ v@@ e, but our b@@ ig@@ n@@ , but our b@@ ir@@ ds of the b@@ ir@@ ds of it.
