And last year I showed these two slight showing that the last three million years to show that the last three million years of the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States was curricate.
But this distinctive the recorded of this specific problem because it doesn't show the disease of the ice of ice.
The ice capital in the North Pole, in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide slide, I shows is a version of what the last 25 years of what happened 25 years old.
The permanent ice is cleared in red.
As you can see, it looks at dark blued.
That's the yearal ice during the winter.
And it cracks in summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or older is almost like blood, is almost like blood, which is from the body's fields here.
In 25 years is the showing this to this thing.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelebrates and there is a very big amount of warms carber there, when it is descended carbon diase, when it designed by microws in methane.
And, the leave amount of the total response in the atmosphere, would double that could double the amount of the atmosphere.
In some undid anyboars in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another team to another unep member.
Whoo! What it is OK. The question is real to we will be able to be that won't be
A reason for that, is that this huge warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver
The water is bigger than ever ever bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua's sua's in South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea leap because it comes up because it smell because it comes in the sea legal comes in the sea legal comes in the sea legal comes in the sea.
These streams are taking flight to flip thing.
On the other side of the planet, on the south police of the planet, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And, the last month, scientists scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the south of the south Pole very quickly fast, with some subjects.
The whole continent is six meters of six feet of six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massa, there are now new now, that were new now, that were going to be glaciers were going to be glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population gets the population is getting water from that melt water from that melt time.
In Andes, this gline is this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeared, it disappears the drinkwater.
In California was a 40 percent in California of 40 percent in the snow.
It comes in the water reseries of the water reservice.
And as you could read read reakthing, the predictions are none.
This global dreams of dramatic dramatic stye of forest fired fired of forest fires.
And the number of natural rams around the world is still and never never seen the incredible and never fast,
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the present 75 years.
This pattern is completely intention.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 to CO2 hours --
25 miles every day in our oceans, Look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, west, from America, west, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a dragle double daling of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great cause of the Earth, is descending descened, which is designed for 20 percent money for 20 percent fossil fuel ssiils.
Oil is a problem, and voice is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extended to China.
And there was a lot of more urban instant carbon carbon center.
But we see a counter.
These are the voice carbon that the building was annutrals, and where green alternatives and where green alternatives were proposed in the last years,
There is a political battle on the country.
The step carbon and oil industire gave industire gave to promot clean, which is a confidence, which is a genestous carbon clear.
And that image me about something like this.
Anesse, at the churchestest, at me at the home of Tennessee, about four billion liter step,
You probably have seen the news in the news.
This is the one after one after the largest distrip in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertentions of the cool left around the Kerstrip around was the one.
Video: "Frosty the coolman is a black guy is a black guy --
He's a fairly consider here in America, and he makes it makes that our economics.
Frosty the voice carbon the bone day of the day.
He's paid and cutble and came up and cup, and called their job."
Here's a big part of the stepped in West Virginia from the cropped in West Virginia from the barrage.
The largest mine country is the great base of Massey Coal.
Video: Do Blankship -- "Let me clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reme, they don't know what they talk about it."
Al Gore: So Alliance for Klimate protection for two campaign campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of this.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's the reason why it is our important goal is to give a magic contributed to aware of ading addition to the light and the truth of the truth of truth and the truth of the truth of truth and the truth of the truth of truth and that's the truth of the truth of
Fit is, step is not smarket is not smare.
We think it's clean clean clean, and it clean.
So, you don't climate change.
Let me be that but to us about it.
Video: Acteur: Schone carbon you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cool cool center.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of laws.
But that's the sound of song, sound of clean cool technology.
despite the fact that the fact that burning burning the stone of the early warming causes of the Earth, changes the remarkable cities that you see all here.
Look good around, this is the clean urban carbon technology of the day.
Al Gore: Eventually pitied the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security of national security.

The red wire wire is our dependence of fossil fuels, like polluts, like polluts, and inmported oil, and inported oil.
But now there's a small of new solution to get this.
And following America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work America to work that safer and makes us safer and warming.
And eventually a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America.
Al Gore: And the later: And the latch
Video: Stem: It's about re-a-re-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-again.

And then Many of 2: New investments to create good pay good pay of the jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African old African says, "If you want to be fast.
If you want to go to go, go together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
And last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am it. For those who weren't the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever suffered experiment ever supposed in the counters.
It has to be the conditions need to be less than a billion less than a billion of second after the universe to 600 million times a second of second a second.
Enorm ambitious, does
This is the machine onder Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of the detectors that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in building so you can see the scale.
At 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That made a party care in controlly.
It's a picture of the first particle that all the way around the LHC went around the LHC went around with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we had that picture that picture photograph that the machine works, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the largest of the biggest this, or then, when somebody was went to Google and saw that the Internet page, and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
We had a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden machine, which had to do with these gold gold with these golds were week with these gold machine, which had to do with these gold machine, which had to do with these gold machine, which had to do with these gold machine, which had to do with these golden machine, which had to be a week later, we had a problem with these gold.
And those drags 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on full power.
The engineers are going to say, "Not whatever it's too small wear."
They can do that because they can do superceive on all temperature are low-temperature
So at multiple 271 degrees of space the stars, that can drags, that can draw that stream.
In one of the connections between nine thousand magnets in the HC, was a constructivator.
And through the wire was something that was called the electrical resistance that 13 thousand amper crazs.
This was the result.
This is still impression when you realizes that those magnets more than 20 ton away that those magnets were to move inches about 30 centimeter.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to put them out of it, what we did.
We all have them when we all tools tool.
Now they're now back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We'll put it again, and we expect measures in Juni or Juni, so we can go to figure out what the building stones of the universe.
Now, of course, that have incidents that debate started to debate the value of science. It's easily. It's easily. It's easily to considered
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be further than ever beyond the LHC.
I leave the last words at English scientist Humphrey Davy, I did during the device of his learning experiments of his learning experiments of his learning experiments was Michael Faraday, this is what is so dangerous than to take our images of the human beings are not going to be able to be completely that there are no mysteries to the nature, and that is not completely our completely that our conversary is to be neces."
Thank you.
I'd like to start with you to ask to you back to your childhood when you played with blocks.
When you discovered how to go to understand how to understand aware in and consciously problems to learn by the way, with the depended with and depenter relationships.
Rumultiply is strong because with the understand of the world to understand
If an information inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my adviseur Pattion and my compassion -- I started asking to ask Jeevancing a computer of computer -- what if we would used a computer information that one mouse of fingeral fingeral fingeral reauthoration that we could move information with a small information that we could put information with a shock of information that we could actually information that we do confit to information to undered information to the pattact information fy information fected information fulation fect fectivact fulaturive ree information fulaturysulation that ence that encluence is that ence that
and can orders as we want to leave orders and as we can either orders and can orders and eive orders can orders orders and earders can orders orders and earders can ear?
This question of this question that we decided that we decided to search an answer, by the building of Siftables.
Sift is a Sift is a Sift of interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be moved with the hand they can movement each other, they can detect each other detect and they contact a screen, and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade by understanding the cue of blocks they can be moved by understand
And basically Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
Because this aid that these tools have a more physical different of their movement and of the movement and of the way we movement and even showing them movement and even fun, there are different new and funning new and fun.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is that Sift is to show a video that played by cancering the same thing and others and others and played the back of the result,
These interactive portraits are conscious of consciousness.
And indicately, they will interested in each other, they will interest.
If they get surrounded it and they can do this and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to certain this, and they can do this and then anything.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the using of the interaction, as it was a color as it was a color as it was a fluid as a color was a fluid as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of interesting consequences that one was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interest
In this example three Siftables away for the case and I can use them to go into a fairly craft in a leg where they get mixed to go.
If we have drive to go back to what we did back.
There are some clear capabilities for education, mathematics with languages with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things fast fast as fast as we want to try fast and the result indicately.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programmatic programatic ship.
So here we show you a game a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single raround a letter at every Siftable, and shaped words are controllered in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the reshake a very resulty resultors with break with means considered opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm showed it to be able to make it out to make a video of it.
They were actually real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have instructions that people need to have instructions
Everything you have to say, "Make word." and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at tests.
That's our young boates tester, right?
Blick it looks just the Siftables wish to step the Siftable.
For him were just blockies.
Here is an interactive painting showed an interactive painting
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrates.
He can bring new characters in the scene bringing with that characters with that character of the table with that character of the table to regular with that characters
Here it is coming up the sun coming up the sun coming up here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done done ! Yeah!
By shake the shake Siftables and the next to each other, it can respond to each other, and so, Wallet up with each other, wis!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decision how it walks.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example that I'm going to show that I will show you that Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent sound the lead, where every Siftables and drue.
One has one one of the variations, where you can choose which you want to use which you want to use what you want to use.
And these sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected so you can depick it pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the attions of a leading Sift of a leg Sift of live controlling effects as reverb and filter.
They're being a sound and addition of sound and adapted by can.
Anyway, the general effects like tempo and volume that are pated on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a slight pattern by an extra lead.
Now I place the basic.
Video: That's now I feed some slagwork.
Video: There I can buy the filter to the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: I can accelerate it by the cans of the cancounters of blocky.
Video: Now I buy the filter to the filter to the filter to the filter of the expression.
Video: I can recognize it pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to planned everything, but I can improvise it very longer and shorter as I want.
With finally the dims of the following through the volume shed Sift to left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people, my passion of computer interfaces that are standing better interfaces that are better in the way our brains and lights.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area design of course with some possibilities that we develop develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this only the tribute is that this only information to reach a very new generation to interact with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to go out with you.
I'm writing writing
Books writing is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm saying to write for for for for for a long time.
And yet there is a very until recently, in my life and career and career that I had to re-reinfired with my work and reagain,
It began with a book that I wrote under the book, a memoire: "Eten, Biddy, Biddous," which is very opposition to my earlier work and an international existed the entire world and an international exister.
The result is that people have me and always does me always that I came up with the country.
Well, really, what -- it does --
People come to me and ask to me and ask care to me and ask that you can never be able to equired this success is never equival?
Do you write that you will read your whole life will remain writing but never it more a book is publish to publis?
Do you don't want to do that?"
And, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very very much that I remember 20 years ago -- I was when I was a teenager, when I was told that I wanted to write write 20 years ago.
People said, "Do you wouldn't you get succcess success success success is that you never get succcess of yourself?
Do you don't want to be afraid for reference, you will go through this?
Do you don't afraid that you live to this work without that there ever seen that there ever does something from the pate, and you will destrip on the public axy?
One of the strets.
And in the short, my answer to that questions questions to this questions that questions to this questions of the answer comes to this questions that questions questions is coming to this questions comes to this questions of the answer questions that questions in the shorts.
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called that becomes
Always the way.
But I'm also much other things that you don't want to know that for a lot of other things that all of it.
For seedly, and other single things.
But what does write writing myself the last time that that fear from,
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody is to be afraid to be afraid for the work for the work of the earth are solik?
What is so particularly so particularly is that we make us to make the effects of it on the spirit of the minds, something that is not happening in the mindness of the work work is not going to happen to be quite such a whole work is not going to be able to creative processes that we do not happens to creative processe
Take my father. He was chemistry, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years that he worked in the 40 years that he was asked to be able to get it to be afraid or he didn't afragid for it.
And that's what "John, how is it with your chemistritic?"
No, so didn't be talking about it.
To be fair fair fair engineers have been through the centuries have not the reputation of manician-depression of manical depression alcoholists.
Schease, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human beings have the reputational human beings.
Look at the grimy thought of the most magnificant spirities of the 20th century.
Many died young, often young, often by self.
And even those those who are not suicide no suicide of the suicide under their gave under their gaves under their gaves are oddge.
In the last interview for his dead said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a pretty thing to say about your life work.
But from this kind of type we don't look more up.
We've heard it all earlier and have it with such a smooth.
The universal thought is that creativity implicated is involved with suffering is that an artistant existence.
So that's why I want everybody here today ask to that idea can you live that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it now I think it doesn't really think about it doesn't do any pretty prety not thought.
I think it's realized the represent.
And also ance again.
I wouldn't like to see this century that this century.
We can do creative spores a lot of better to live sport a lot of life.
I know certainly that it for me, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark thought of life.
Seal, the fase that my career in which my career now is now in.
Go only after: I'm young, amper resulty years.
I can may be a four decade of decades.
Here probably will be anything that I'm going to publish everything that I've been seen as it work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can slap you probably smell is my largest success of success for behind me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you think about that, you know, for you know? You know, for nine hours to the next hours to the newer hours to the edrank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me show me with the work I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work that
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long thinking about the conclusion that I can only go through with writing when I can only descreening a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process of the process of inside the process of inside the process of conclusion as I can only think of the conclusion as long protect as I can on
I have to write a safe distance between myself and my overboard myself and my overwhole is understanding publications.
I looked at the last year for ways to ways that do.
I have done in the history and have me depth in other societies have found in other societies have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has taken me to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Great the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity coming from themselves.
Men believity was that creativity was a good spirit was a good spirit was a distance, unknowledge, to the human unknowledge.
The Greeks called this demonstrings of creativity spirit of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon who was a demon that he had a demon that words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of a same idea.
And in the called the called creative spirit was a geniused a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, pient,
In their political discused to be a geniused entities that are opposed in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the home.
If the artists was working on the genius,
And then he gave shape shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to work in his work.
The artists was taken so in protection to protecism against for example,
If you were brilliant to be able to go there, you couldn't all the every egger for it.
Everybody knew that a knamely that you had health.
Well, you work up with the work of you, it was not just you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genius.
Long time is that the Wests creativity was considered to be creativity was considered
Then came the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the individual human universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attended from the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity was completely from the individual came from the individual continue came out of individual dishes.
And for the first time in history was about artists of artists said that they were a genius, and not that they were a genius.
I have to say that I think I think a big faul.
To one person, one person, one person, one single individual that he or she she's fating the fature of the century, the source of the century of eternal mystery, of everything is to familiar is to fragile a fragile human psyche.
Anybody asks somebody asks the sun in sun click.
Egos are blowing up to huge proportions and there are incredibly incredibly high expectations of exprestations to exprestations
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists design.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back understanding olders the relationship between the human and the creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Well, light we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably people who are in the audience people who read response to have tools about the idea that eliminating equires of artist decade the work of artists to inspirate artists to inspirate arts.
It doesn't seem to be getting you all over there.
And yet I wonder it -- I wonder
Why not?
Why would we do that thought that thought that thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought that would we do that thought to be thinking?
It was just showed as much showed as much as all the other explanations of the total incomputability that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided that decided to the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit has a little bit of a little bit of all the presence -- so in fact, it doesn't always the creative process here, it doesn't always rational process to be rational process --
That sometimes almost paranoral.
I mean, I mean until American close Ruth Stone meet meet Ruth Stone of the amazing American close of American closer Ruth Stone of the great American close close of the amazing American close of the amazing American close of the amazing American close of Americ
She's in the ningendestic. Her lives writing through they close to call the write of the nein.
She told me about her right on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was work, they felt up to the felt a poem close of country.
It was, so said she said, as if there was a big golf came air came air came air came air craft.
As a poem golf closing about the country to her it.
She felt that the ground, it was started shaking her feel and knew that knew that point to do that moment to do that moment for her life.
And she followed by the poem and she had to go through the close and paper than the possible, and see paper and picks.
When the close was poem by her her was that her only her only to write it was to writing it.
Sometimes she wasn't fast.
Then run, but run, it doesn't reach house.
At such moments school poem through her hometers, disappearing about the fields, in her words -- to another power.
I think it was also felt -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- they were the close to the poem -- they almost miste.
And then she was in looking for for and paper and paper and paper, it was close by her its it.
Juist at that moment she had a pencounters.
And with her other hand, so told me she plucked me to she picked up the sky.
And she picked up with his tail, and put it back in her body, and she wrote back in her body, as she wrote the way back of his body.
In that cases came up with the close came in such a paper and paper but then in the crazy order.
When I heard that I thought -- what I thought happened, so decided my creative process of creative process
And this is my creative process not work! I'm not a medium!
I'm a miled mic, which every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating and trans through the same time.
But even in that daily swood, I have such a experience.
You will know it myself, as well, that sense that there are creative ideas in your burrelate ideas in your broil that you can identify impossible you can identify including that you can identify impossible.
What is that source?
How can we use it without that we have been doing with?
At a way that it is good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musician is musician example, Tom Waits.
A couple of years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the way to do it about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life have been dealing of the showing of the same thing that is trying to get all power to get to the uncontinue to get incontinue to the unitially creative impulses that indivaable to him.
With the years, for the years was Tom some rough.
Angeles on a day he reflect in Los Angeles, and changed it process and changed it process
And as he was so realized that he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided that it does fail that failed is understand it does.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to hold it to hold it it --
But that wouldn't be it.
He had no paper -- not a paper rates, no paper right.
The amazing exciting exciting excited to him: "I went the melody remains me every single eudicates me eught equalize eught to follow.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't realize in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the wall?"
"Do you really want to write a song of writing a song of the writing of a song of you can write a song of you can write a song of the writing of a song that you can get a song of the real that I can really
And if you really want this song, you have to go later, you have to reach one of you have to be a time for you.
Now, you won't go through somebody else does fall.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohensive that moment was writing the process of very different.
The work is the same self, with the same dark of the same dark to.
But the sware spaning that creative process in him reflect to the creative process of energy from the genius.
The genius, to close it was on the skin and listed only currently up.
And realized that there was no realized to go through through this.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre society between between Tom and the owner-diaspect that was not quite tallowed to be at all.
That story has changed my way of works.
I've been taking a later of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddines.
At a crazy moment I despair.
You know that you don't want to work well, but not want to be good and you think it is a terrible disaster book. It is the book one.
Not sumer bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad.
I thought I thought the entire project.
Then I remembered Tom that they did, and I decided to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power to be a power
I wish from my manuscript and founded me to a leg corner of the room.
And I said hardop: "Listen then, we know everybody that if this is not just coming through me.
You can see that I'm in the stop in the same thing I have.
More can't give me it.
If you think it must be better can, you have to do you.
Do you can't say that? Do you wouldn't you do that.
I just write because that's the one of my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are avoid avoid that again, you know, it's a simply on the office of the office of the office of the office that again.
Tja--- United it comes up here on the country,
Eured came back in the North African desert people to get together to dance the months to sack in Marlight music.
And hours and hours back to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes the real particular particularly happened to be such a particular particular thing.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you know, you also have you also see in a performer.
It was like the time and the dance of the time and the dance of the stape of step.
He nothing else than the thousands of nights of nights of souldn't have anything together.
And suddenly he didn't seemed only a human being.
In him, under him, above it up.
A fired fired fired through fired hour.
If such a destice happened, people who were able to get Dan they started clapping and curring in charge, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historically factor: When the Moren South South South Span, they browed this well.
The question is real through the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, olone."
That hear you today the day in died, and flamengodness.
If a pance of Spanist something that is impossible or magically does, "Allah, olying, Allah, olying, Allah, brad."
And, understand: a small of God's God.
Prifice what we need.
Lastig is that the dance the following morning to discover the morning that he discovered on dince the next morning to the edle challenges that the morning is not a godate charge is going to have more it.
At that moment is it again, a little older man with designs that may never be, ever before will never come to such high high high high high h high to be again.
Maybe never going to have anybody God associated during his dance.
What does it have to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to small smooth, for a creative spirit of a creative spirit.
But so painful need to be not need to be to.
Now, imagine not excited that the most unusual aspects of your person coming out of yourself.
Imagine you believe that you believe it that you have a whiled of a while, of not resource.
When you are, when you're ready around they're going to spend to somebody else.
That's how considered everything.
I high inside that thought of thought that though.
The last months I've worked on a book that inside solives will appearing to be able to different long reach to dealing in the last months of the last months
The follower of that illuster progress deal.
If my thought to go to me with me hold me to hold me the same before, I don't know whatever it doesn't fright.
Just just take your work.
just the line thing you do, whatever it is.
If you task you very task you very too.
If the Goddous geniused to decide to decide to decide in your work at any time, one of the wonderful sources by lying to leave in your work through the wonderful source, "Olunit!"
That's not happening then, dance it down.
And also then, "Ollet ong time!"
I believe that believe that harted.
"Ole any!" whatever we pure out of human love and owness went to put up by the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olly.
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about a couple of these projects, and what that can mean enome and what that can mean encounter, and what that can mean of genes.
We actually start to go from a new point: we were the biology of the digitizers, and now we were trying to go from that digital code, to go from that digital code, with the designs and synthesize designs and synthesize life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" I tried to think what many biologists tried to understand on a different levels in different levels.
We tried different approach to leave different approach to miniimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitalize.
When we have sequenced, the human genome ced, went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for life to ask regenerate life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a kind of that can multiply multiply in a laboratory,
And we tried to look if we can get to look at a non-genome can get genome smaller genome
We can gene in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or soon, that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively simple, simple, simple, simple.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes that we can switched a living couldn't probably that this would be a living cell.
We decided that the only single prevalue to synthesizing this chromosome, so that we could dediscribe so that we could dediscover the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, as we started a chromosome, "Can we synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic as well.
Now, the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never see?
And, if we can do that, can be a chromosome, "
A chromosome, by the way, it's a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is acceasy of life is on exponential well.
Our ability to write the genetic code, but it takes a pretty slowly slowly to describe of genetic code.
And our last point would it be at this moment would be at the exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago, we started with this thing.
There were a number of stage, to start with a bio-ethic typical tycle of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be hard to be hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the more you make it more mistakes there.
So we had to take a new method for society of these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes and corrating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempting with the digital information of the genome information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that death.
We designed the pieces were did the folercorrection.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the time we read an inert piece of chemical stop, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria cously, the genetic code, and viral particles making it went to make a piece of chemical particles
The viral particles were called when it was called the cells, they came back and deathed the E. coli.
I was until I was speak with the oil industry, and I said that she model but it tells to be fast.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in size, so we could varians viruses, so we could varians varians ...
to understand what the real real components of a living cell.
The design is critical and when you start with digital information in the computer than that it need to be very accurable.
When we first first crazed this genome of genome in 1995 was the standard of the default per 10,000 baseparates.
And then we found the resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence was used to start to start to start to start to start start to start start to start out and start to start to start doing
And, the design is design the design of the design of that 50 letters are long that have to considered with the other pieces of 50 letters to build so they can design so they can go together so that they can go together.
We designing up here unique unique in the same time.
Maybe you read that we read water notes.
There's thinking about this: we have a squareas squareas -- A, C, Going and T.
Trios of those letters codes for roughout 20 aminose -- that there is a long-based attack for each aminozero-down.
So we can use the genetic code, we can use word to write words in front of writing the genetic code.
And then we only counters we only called the me.
Some were telling that there were no poems that there were no poems were not poems of them.
We have designed these pieces that we can eating them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they put and in each other.
And we started making pieces of them start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters were long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters, until 2,00.
We came up with every stage, we could see a flasses of these pieces so we could sequence, because we want to create a process that is very robusting is that very robust.
We're trying to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of this looks like a basketball of the basketbal.
And as we come to get to the very big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparate baseparate -- they were not so easily more than 100,000 base.
That is the example tools of all modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to raise the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologist recombination." It is used by the biology to repaDNA to repaDNA to repay that pieces can feet DNA can feet up with the biology of the biology to repay called "homology to repath.
Here's an example of the same thing.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million rad rad to radiation on the same three million rad rad to radiodurance that is a organism called Deinococcus radiodurance that is a organism called Deinococcus radio durance that three million ra
Now you see that in the top panel, she was a chromosome, just the chromosome, just from each other.
12 hours later it was put in the way it was in each other, exactly as it was first like it was first like it was first like it was first like it was first to be in each other,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely dried up with it.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can life in space that can existence move, which can find forward the existence.
NASA has mary shows that there is a lot of the way, there's a lot of of the way.
Here's a real microphotograph of the molecule that we've made with these processes -- actually usually with these processes -- actually only gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we were in deed.
Gist makes that they automatically conceived automatically conceive.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a six of six seconds.
This is the publish we spent incentive.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The moleculecule walks more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point speak to a 10-point speaks only needed to pressure, it is to press the genetic code.
Are we start to start a chromosome? How do we start it?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria is a much complicated.
It's also simply if you put under eukaryots, as we just knew the cell and does it just does the cell cell and that's what you know if it clong.
And the bacteria of chromosome, the chromosome, in the cell that we have a complete integrated that we have a full transplant transplantation of a chromosome, and can activate a fairly to another, and it can activate.
We have a chromosome of a microber of a microber species.
These are about as far from each other as people and mously removed as people and mously mously away as people and mously remove.
We add some extra gene so that we could select for this chromosome.
We did with enzymes to enzymes to make all the protein all of the protect piece of the device of the protect of the egggated with enzymes to make all the protected egggs.
It was quite sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very advanced graphical images here -- the new chromosomes -- the new chromosome of the cell.
And we thought that it would come to show you what we tried to develop the process of developing further to develop process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of those who have a second chromosome, or a third chromosome, or a third thousands of properties in one time they add thousands of properties have to the species.
People who represent evolution to represent the same thing that is not much biology have been a lot of biology community.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzymes that actually increased DNA.
The chromosome, the chromosome, there was not every one of the cell has not either.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop it -- well, well,
It was expression, and the recognized the other chromosome, and the recognizing chromosome, and therefore, and why we had the cell chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time disappeared all the characteristics of the one species of the species and changed completely in the new species, and it changed on the new software that we stopped in the cell software that we stopped in the cell of course,
All the protects changed the membrans changed -- when we read the genetic code, it was exactly changed.
This may sounds like genomical chemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to fundamental DNA, to fundamentally.
Good, I've been paying earlier that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is a half billion years evolution, and I have paid that we may have a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical designs that there are a new species on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's clearly clearly when you look at what it needs to look at what it is.
We're going to go from six-en-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context place, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us that am in 1946; within 40 years will be that there are four are.
We have transporting with food with food with food, with cleaning water, drugs, fuel on-half billion.
That's showing that becomes to do.
We use five billion ton collaborates are five oil.
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we take biological processes in eymight or anything to replace that process to replace that is a huge challenge.
Then there is a naturally all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is that comes in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere is that coming carbon dioxide of that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is that coming in the atmosphere coming carbon dioxide of the stor that coming in the at
And through our global discoveries have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had a dozen of components, and look at the diversity that has come out of diversity that is compresent from there.
We're pretty concertainly concertainly and our imagination.
We've got this technique fast, we have this very quickly synthesize so-genomics to do combination genomics to do so-genomics.
We've got the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes of thinking about 20 million different genes to optimize octan, or drugs to producate octan, new vaccines, we can producate a small team biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design design software that we work on the way that we work on the computer, and a new kind of computer.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We focus on fourth generations.
And you know, recently have seen ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We second second and third generation that will come in, as sugar, as sugar, as sugar, as sugar, as sugar, as a different species like octan, or different species of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology biology can have big influence, without the food price and makes the available of the food price is as we start with CO2 as his food such and we think that we are design the first food designing it in that way, and we think we think that we think we are the first square fun inside of the first squarters to five fuel insix months to have food.
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the depense, about 2.5 miles dep, in cooks, at the counced temperature and a half miled of the depended depened.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at or we can take CO2 we can take a little bit of driving through pipelled to factories, where that CO2 is that CO2 is to send this process fuel -- to send this process.
So in a short, we think we think we are able to continue that we are able to basic question: What is life?"
We actually have real, you know, -- the soccasional industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, what?
A important energy source.
But we also now we're working on these tools to think of these tools to think of these pictures to think of these tools.
This year was the flu -- we always just behind the facts of facts like it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by combined vaccinated vaccines.
So you can see how the future is going to change the future of evolution tree is going to change evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and finally eukaryota.
We're still away from the improviding humans.
Our goal is to certainly to sure, we make a chance for long enough to survive that may be able to do that may be doing that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be a chance to survive that may be a chance long enough to survive that maybe we make a chance long enough to survive
What I want to show you as first show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to go to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you local local or on the immense of visual data can work on the fairly diseas.
We look at this is what we look at this very digital images and can remains in the digital images and may be done and made it to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images are or images or images are either than how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixe.
It doesn't matter anything like because the only exprestations would influence, on a such system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image picture that that way.
This is the graute of Dickens. Every collapiece.
To evidence that it's actually text text is, and we can't do a imagination, to show that this really text is not imagination.
Maybe this is a slight way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't recomment.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an extremely of The Guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capital is actually a scale medium.
We also done with the corner of the Guardian.
We've made a nep advertise of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise, and we have extra information information information information information -- and we have extra neck advertise.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make these ideas that we can really do the constrains of actives through the screen of acceptive.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other thing.
Of course, lands for a hand maps for a technology like this, I won't spend to a technology like this, I won't spending this field, except that we can contribute this fields.
These are all the way in the U.S.
And put up on the top of the NASA .
Let's look at something else.
This is a married live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who connected.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful-computer vision by Noah Snah Snah Snavidency of Washington, dedeeply by Steve Steve Seitz U.W.
And Rick Sself Rick Sself Research. A called Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have been contains have been converted to real space -- the Grassi Lakes in Canadian Rockies in the Canadian Rockies -- where they genomic. Seean Rockies -- where they are genome diashws or panormas, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is a time there, other environments.
There are much more space.
I want to like a Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a question of Photosynth, and this is from Photosynth, which we work this summunicate summunicate of the communicating power to the communicating of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to do with the advocature with the advocatory and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Day, with images from Flickr. You just just looks like Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and such the campus and such the campus and such the campus and the campus and the campus and you get imaged images of people in Flickr. You can just looked like Flickryed in Flickr, and you looks like Flickr.
And every one of these orange looking at the picture that part of this model of fashion this model of model of this model of model in the model.
And so this are all Flickr flickr that are space in this way room in this way room in this way room of space.
And we can close simple dealing incredible depened.
I would never work I thought I'd ever thought I'd ever been working at Microsoft.
It's too excited to be so certainly about this is to be so called in this way.
I believe that these are typically cameras are cameras are cameras are craflexcameras is a big number of them, a big number of them.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much covered by fact, and such the such of the face and such the similar and such like through faces and such as much covered by fact, there are so much covered by fact, there are so much covered by facts,
Because in this shows is even a series of pictures -- here's them.
This is a poster of the Notre Dealso that is a good cheated by the program.
If we dive the poster in the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- from the whole collective memory of the whole collective memory of the whole -- and coppositive that everything to each other.
All these pictures are considered with each other, and shapes a very larger than the subject of the parts.
You have a model that from the earth of Earth of the earth of Earth of the earth of the Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth has earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of you have an earth of the whose Earth of the whole Earth of you have an model that Earth of you have an entire Earth.
See this as a pollutting on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity, when it uses using it when it uses to be able to grow the benefits for people who used it.
Their own photographs are being metapholars of metaphydle somebody else
When somebody would like to click all these sacred and their names and their names of the Notre Deame, my photograph of the Notre Dease, and I can use as a access to that space, which metaph, using every much of everybody is such a kind of cross-modal, and creating social experience.
And of course, is the sature product from this immense virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from the Earth, who is not only from the satellites and other applicative memory and other applicative memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are shared by everybody in the world can buy together to the world together?
BA: Yes. What this is really does discovery.
The create to your wish, hyperperperlinks between images.
And it does that based the data in the image.
And that is designed exciting when you think about the richdoing when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look for the picture looks for images, you figure out in, and the text on the web page, and the text on the webpage, much information about what the image.
What if you crazy that image is to all your imagination?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount of the amount of wealth that comes out of that makes making out of that, it's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefore icity.
One of the intense pleasure of travel and from eating the ability to live between they're not forget to live the old onest, which are not forget to the old of the decision in the wind, the reason by reason by reasons, the profession in blags, the profession in blags.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still Milky still Way the myths of Instance, or that the myths of Instancestors, or that the Himalaya boodhist on the breath, or remember remember is remember to remember response to the anthropology of anthropology anthropology of anthropology mode, but is not one model of the model,
the consequences of a set of course, set that made our ancestors ago,
Naturally, we all share the same adaptting requestion: Worlerned kids were born.
We all do it inition rites.
And, with the individeal separation by the death.
So it can't be surprise that we sings, dance dances and art have done and art
But interesting is the unique cadance of the dance and the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the dance of culture.
Or that now is to Penan in the skian in the skia, or the Voodoms in Haiti, or the front of the Caisut-basically in North Kaisut-basically in the Andes-basically in the Sahara. -- this is the guy of the Carai in the heart of the Sahara. -- this is the monthy slight of the ma, a month, or now along massive alongma song-ma,
Everest, the goda godin-mother mother of the world.
They all learn us all that we can think we can think differently, differently, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you hope just hope to do.
And together shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her as important life as the biological life web: the biosphere.
This cultural life-web you can imagine as a bit as a eating country.
The country to define the defining of all the total thought of all the countries, mythes, mythes, mythes, ideas that are consciously through the human imagination that are consciousness of us are consciousness.
The country is the big nalatencounters of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we can be able and we can be amazing that we can be amazing curious species.
Like the biosphere is a slight is the eath face that eye -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take a bit of leads that at least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of extinct because that's not true.
And right that, the most apocalyptic scenario comes doesn't even come in the neighborhood comes from the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of language.
Then everybody here was born born born of the last thousand languages on Earth product.
A language is more than words, or her gramatic rules.
A language is a cuter, of the human soul.
It's the vehicle of view that the soul of culture, the material world reached material world reached
Every language is a century of mind spiritual mind, a distant of distinction, a ecosystem to spiritual possibility.
From that six-thousand languages today the day of that is not flistening in children flistening in children flistening language.
They are not learned babies to be able babies to be able babies to be able babies no longer to be a longer longer to be a longer longer to be able babies no longer to be done longer to be increased babies no longer to be increased babies no longer to be increased babies to be increased babies to be a
Effective means that means have a change change, that they dead.
Is there something that is such a way of reverse by stilence, the last of your people, the last of your people, not to have the wisdom of the reason of the children's promise or the promise of the kids of the children?
Priveral that is somebody's benefit of a state destate every two weeks somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks die, because every two weeks die, the last letter-fairly age.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't have better place if we all the same language of the same language of you would speak? I say, "Super, Kantone."
Or Kogi," you will realize, you will realize, how it wouldn't be your own language
So what I really want to do is taking you today is taking you on a short journey by the eating nershed to sketches of what is in fact,
Many of us forget that when I'm talking about another way of being a different way of being a different ways.
For example, this Barasana child in the North Amazonon the North Amazonon the anaconda, which believes that they flower from the east crace of sacred skier on skyold snast, in the brain.
This is a folk that cognitive the color blue and green not supposed because it of the skuls of the skil of the skip of the equal dependent of the equal dependent.
They have a counter-marriage rule, which is called linguistic example, which is called you to somebody need to somebody by the way,
This has his roots in mythological past but the extraordinary folks in their homes or seven talks to their home, or seven talks to be solid by this crooks, but you never heart somebody hears a language of tales.
They simply simply and start speaking.
One of the fascinated tribes that I lived the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in North Ecuador, a completely in 1958 performance.
In 1957 missionarizes missionariss, but they made a critical phance.
And the skiing pictures of themselves from themselves from our ideas, where they were making a friendly two-dimensional image.
They went the pictures and tried the shape behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the photographs and tried to fine.
When they found nothing they found that the dunique they were dunglobal them, after the missionarians with spears with speared with spearned
But the Waorani not only the Waorani not only examinations, but also each other.
Fift percent of their dying dance came from their darkid.
We could genealogies could eight generations back to eight generations that we could fall two cases of a natural death of course,
When we gave showing they gave that one man ever died that one man ever died from olderdom ever died by older, and then they were still a connection of the same time, they had a amazing knowledge,
Their hunters could be able to hunters could smell on 40 passes and tell animal of animal it was.

To of this sensational things that can understand what to understand something about this particularly belief, that is not a cult magic of Vodoun magic is that not a cult magic.
It's a complex metaphysical world-image, very interesting.
Would I ask you the great global religions, what would you call say w?
Christian thing, ism, islam, boodhism, jodent eating eating eat.
One continent is always outside of the touch of the tack that Africa didn't believe that Africa didn't believe that we had this thing.

What foodoo is so interesting is the living death.
The living booms are the mind.
The spirit can be associated by the Great Water, answering on the dancountering of the living time, the soul of the living time, so that during one that one during the following moment the following is the following is the following is the following is the following of the following of the mind-device of the mind Water, the mind of the last device of the mind of the last of the last valuving the souldn't be move,

This leads to a blue-fold tools in trance that fools in trance that foot glowing columning collapses.
This is a demos demonstrates the ability to influence the mind to influence the mind of the mind is extreme extreme extreme is in extreme extreme is

"You know, it's like I said you.
And so beautiful, it's real. It's too protect to protect themselves the older brothers.
And then, we are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
At this point is intuition is very important.
If we think of indigenous people, we figure out Rousseau and the old fabeling fabeling of the epartal wildlife is an idea that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we put Thoreau and say that these people, closer to Earth than we did.
Indicine, indigenous people, nor is by nor by nostalgy.
For both is few space in the malaria moerass of the Asmat or in the icrowing of Tibet. Designing in the imagines of Tibet. Designing in the mystical mystical mystical mystical of Earth is based by the idea of subtly intuitional intuitional intuition: it can be able to be consciously consciousnessared that the idea is that the Earth of the consciousness of the reage.
What does that mean? It means a small child out of the Andes, which growth is with the belief that the mountain Apu-mine that the mountains are or her human will be able to be a different relationship that will have a little child that place will have a small child out of Montana, opposition that the idea that the mountain step of the idea that will have a step of mine.
Or it the lives of a minute or a lot of this, irrelevant.
And interesting is the metaphor that defines the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capitalize to become caps.
That made me a different human than my friends of the Kwagiure, who believe that those forses, who believe that those forses, the Kuxxwhuxx-snavily of the Hemel and the Kroming Snavel of the world's Earth in the world of the world-d-braining around world in the north world-based world in the north the world's north of the Kuxwherever the came in the north of the Kuxture and the came to the regame to the regular spirite that those fore of the laborderstriends of the Hevirst Stunities of the Hemel and the Hemel and the Hemel
These mind are important during their Hamatsa-in-during their Hamatsa-incredibly during their Hamatsa-legs.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create a different realities, you start to get a number of their extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary of their extraordinary extraordinary of their external extraordinary of their extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary discoveries, you start to create this plant.
It's a picture that I jumped journey.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive computer from the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayaayhuca is so fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it. It's built to it. It's built up from two sources.
And the side of the standing done that better carboline, harmaline and harmaline in the wireline and harmaline in the same hallucinating works.
If you take only the plant looks like a blue skyness skyness, you know, floating your drives drive.
The plant is mixed with leaves of a coffee of a coffee every single depics.
The plant shows powerful tryptamines, naudicated to brain dimethyltryptonine, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxyltryptamine.
Do you ever have the Yanomami as they snumber of socusion of different species that substance of different species that have methoxyltryptamine?
That pools nose is when you remember now is shot with barokage, to countries to countries on an electricity. This is not a distribution of the reality; it design the reality; it design the reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shtes, to convincing the psychedge -- a man who discovered the psychedge of his paddos in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptomated that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinated as hallucinated to experience the hallucination. Tryptamination. Tryptamination. Tryptamines are not oral oral org, because they designed their effect of the human darms of the human darms oxiday.
They can only oral oral to be enoral with something that the samine, you know, the samine,
The fascinating is that the better carbolines in the limited mouth-samine-suppression of the tryptamine-suppression of the tryptamine, the same to eight morfological species are two morphological species are two morfological species that are combinated species a biochemical various that are bigger than the parts that the parts are of the parts of the parts that is that the parts of the shineed?
We say euphistic "trial and there's ror, which is that as meaningle-designed designers.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, the plants that means that means that does that means can be 17 variants of ayhuge distance of ayhuge distance to identify all the big distance that would be in our eyes would be identify to identify the desire of the eyes would be identify in our eyes would be the big distance of ayayayaayayaayaayayaayaayaaayaaaayaayayhumans of the case, which mean, they could do that ds.
If you ask their question how they map, they say, "I thought you know something of plants say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
You know whole it all left at all. I said "no."
And it turns out to you all 17 species in a night in a night in different tools in different tools in different typical tools.
You don't try to do with Harvard, but it's a piece of boot boot than gunder than gunderstand count counters.
Now, the problem is that even those of us that even those sympathy at the sympathy of indigenous people, as curious and showing up as curious and seeing a foot-never gone in the history of the world, meaning our world, basically world in the scale.
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember to be remembers or technological innovations, but earlier as the era era time in which we were stood in the mass destructive participating or passive passive instance.
All cultures have always part of a dance with new life of life possibilities.
Techtechnology is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians didn't stop Siously, when they gaved their pile, and tree and tree their boat, as well, as well, Americans when they gave.
It's not change or technology that technology that that integrity the integrity of the eating nosphere is power.
The wred face of the government.
What you look at the world, you will notice that it doesn't be the fairly of these cultures to dedicate.
These are dynamic living people, whose existence is designed by identified powers that are prepended up their adapts.
Whether this is to reflew designed in the home land of the Penan, a nomadich South Asian atically people to the shape generation in the forestation in the forestation and now is to serve the distant and now prostitution to the rivers, where you can see that the rivers, where you can see that the rivers the river, where you can see that the river, the helpicture, where you can see that the Seeue Chinese Zea's south Chinese way, where Japanish right way.
to fill their creates fill with tree stribes out of the forests.
In the case of the Yanomami are it disease that are inside as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetanan mountains that I do a lot of research of political government of political government.
Genocide, the physical exploiting of a population of universal repression, but eating the destruction of life destroyning of life is not only not only developing the country, but in many areas of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not too containing it until you get on the basic level of the typical level.
I mean, I have a young colleague about 9,000 miles about China to West China to Lhasa.
And when I was at Lhasa came back in Lhasa face that you hear about the statistics where you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroy destroy during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
At that he started dealing dead, he was deaded when the Chinese invasion.
His to flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which is the people in Nepal speake.
His mother farmed because she was rich because she was rich because she was rich rich because she was rich because she was rich rich rich because she was wealth.
He was smoky smokle when he was two and he was two and he was under her counters under her rock.
The sister that was so followed so far was in a food camp.
At one day they were pristed on a Mao. For this showing Mao. For this considered for seven years of the seven years of the desperated in seven years of the same
The pain of Tibet can be inty, but the basic mind, but the completely of the people, is something to clamps.
And finally it comes up the choice.
Do we want to live in a groundation or want to live a colorrice world of diversity or we want to have a colorrich work?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said she was that she directioned that she directioned that we direction.
We wouldn't only see the human imagination are fairly failed to a smal, model thinking, but we would have been able to wake other options that there are other opions.
We can feel uscle us feel in the idea that our species are about [150,000,000000] year.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our landbrow gave us, where we gave our overgave when the potract of the shaman was replaced by the prozero-shot Revolution, and we came a specialization, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history is not the idea that we don't have me the idea that we have all the answers of all the answers that have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to humans are asked to save the meaning of humans are coming with 10,000 different voices.
And it is that we have again, we will discover the ability to be discover to be what we are, a folbeing what we are, a folbeing all the garbaggreat moments and flower.
I went on the northern point of Baffin Island genome was taken with Instead, when I went with Instead,
This guy, Olay: Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inter. In the 1950s were they also far, to figure our souldn't always put in nure in sure.
The opa of Olayuk reflect to go.
The family of viewing for his life and receive him already tools and discovery.
Now you have to understand that the Inside, they didn't use the collapse.
The gline icro-icians were taking originally originally made from fish in karibooks.
Olayucks was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that windown.
He went out, let his break of sea flature and put it into his hands. When the capital counters, shaped it as a lemmet.
He brought a low-bysice on the side.
When it solid was, snailed a dog.
He did did and improvised a harnas.
From the ribbences made a sleed.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice flat front of pools.
Anything around with nothing comes to do, in many way, many symbol for the restance of the Indistance and all indigenous people.
In 19999 gave the Canadian government government is the entire coming back from a piece of country and Texas a piece and Texas so, it's called Nunavut.
It's independent area. They real. They real. They realized all the grounds.
It's a compute exupend example of how a nationstate enough to her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly clearly did for who is tools of the world is tools that she doesn't actually far away away away from the world is not away away away from the world is not going to be able to far away from the world is tools of the world is tools that the way to this police is not far away to this put up to this up.
They're somebody's home country.
They are standing from the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, as that part of the uncleaning of the uncleaning of the hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is going to be extend to the idea that politicians never reach thing.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemics don't think that a polemics can change that stories can change the world, which we probably the best stories that the best stories are the best per 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on TV and our magazine in 156 countries are finding a million-public.
We make a favailable to travel of travel to the food, with our public cultural places, to such a way that the toeshift cultural places by what he looks so interacted by what he looks s to see the most important public of the anthropology will go through the anthropology that we can find a way to live in a multural pluralistic world and live in a multural pluralistic world and live in a multural pluralistage and in and in and in ormulturealistentanize and in oralistakes to live, and
where all the wisdom can contribute to us,
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some of the questions, I dedid a book.
Maybe you can see parallels with information from other sources.
I also try to explain which I may have mistakes that you may mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the western started society.
And that official dogma dogma as following as following the highest levels on the highest level, we need to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good at part of the human existence.
And basically street freedom real is to account to reach a higher property higher property without human beings of thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices are more freedom.
And more freedom, automatically prosperatically more prosperity.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would take to draw during on the during that nobody would be during in our society.
And in our lives is this dogma piled of destroyed in our lifetime.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A mediure.
Anyway, you know, dressings.
And next that 175 can-hundressings are in my supermarketplaces are in my supermarket, extra-virgin oil foil and developed balsamics and different balsos amics and developed amount of the supermarket.
And that you can make number of the dressings own dressings for the case between that 175 species for you.
So that's the map of my supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can stroneoset of streakers, cassettypelled speler, cassettal game peler, cassettal diverster.
And the one electronics you can choose out of this pick out of this piece of language.
You can see six-and-half million systems collecting systems to continue from that store.
Give to -- you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young time ago, you could call kinds of phone services services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't walk it ast. You don't bought it out.
That was the fairly that it never be able to be able to piece of it.
That time.
Today there are a lot of different state.
And that is the diversity is the diversity is the diversity immense.
These are the mobile cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with midely critical letter, and critical critical critical critical critical critical critical critical critical critical critical critical critical breagular basically
Well, light you haven't seen this model in the store, but you can certain of that inside that happens to be very definitely that happens.
And the consequence, people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the point of stuff that are more important than the same of choices is a fact.
Suntee health care -- it's in the United States in the United States that you go to the doctor, and that you tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and saying, "We can do And, we can do And, we can do Anyway.
Again, has this picture and true true of course.
That has this front and counts. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, what does do?"
And the doctors says, "An this faves, and you have this faves, and navaded this faves,
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctors says, "But I'm not you right."
And we call that we call "own increase the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, that the shaware of decision of somebody with increasingly message of things -- the doctor, someone who certainly certainly certainly certainly and not the best condition to take decissions -- the patient. For recipating resources are drugs to recipated a lot of resulls that sound.
Gdress is that sleep to be up because the goal, you can't buy it. I can't buy it.
Why do we make real real reals, if we can't buy them?
because they think we think we go to the next morning our doctor to call that other market to ask that other market drugs to ask that other market medicine.
Our identity, yet a common aspect of us existence, is now the dependentity, as you can see on this slight on this slight of slights.
Our identity is results of our background.
We find ourselves from -- we want to just want to me.
Every every morning to be you think of what for person you want to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that free everybody else that you were going to be able to fastick that you possible so possible, and then then then then possible as fast as possible as possible to kids start.
The only real choice was with writy, not when and what you did and what you follow.
Now lies fast, everything for the opening up for it.
I give lesson particularly intelligent students, which I would develop less homework less homework at less homework in less homework in the same percent less homework at less homework at less homework at less house work at
They're not dominating the last time.
No, they make pressure to choices with choices.
"Well, I marry or not? Well, I married now?
Or will I wait? Take I first first children, or a career or a care?"
These are all showing questions.
They go through to they've got an answer, as this means that they don't get all their homework and get through no good number of their homework number of typical number of them.
And they have equal. It's important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave that technology is to work. Carl uses to work every minute every minute every day, where the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is a place one place, which I love secrets, where WiFi it does it does.
I wouldn't work, because I want to keep the place for member.
But anyway, that enormous choice of work like we whether we wonder to work our still whether we're going to work or now.
We can look at a football competition of our son the son the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all out of standing standards, we call these minute with all kinds of the competition with all kinds of question: "Well, I do this telephone domine?
Well, I write this emailt respone? Well, I write this letter?"
And even if the answer answer is "Ne" we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
What we look at the big, the big, materialistic pockets, life is life: life is a question of foods.
And so this is what the world was used to be looking like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what good is good about is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about it is bad to be bad to be bad about what is bad to do is bad to be bad about what is bad to be bad about what is bad about is bad to be bad about what's bad of the bad is bad of course, so I'm going to talk about it is bad to be bad to be bad to be bad about it is bad to be bad about it is b
That enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects on human beings.
A very opposition is that the earlier is that the earlier is working than completely than completely disages.
With so many choices are finding people find it hard to make a choice to make a choice.
I'll give you a very dramatically example of a very dramatically example, to investiguous pensive plans.
A colleaguard of me was access to investment data from Vanguard, a big police society with about one million employees about 2,000 feed-thousand curities.
She discovered that for every decades that every single design contained the particular two percent desire two percent desire two percent percent of the desire two percent percent of the polities.
Are fifty fundred 10 percent less percent less than fundress than five funds. Why?
Because it at fifty fundar, to choice that people just till the choice to the next day and that people just put up there, and so on.
And from from example.
That means not only that people after their pensioner pensionate because they didn't have a dread, because they didn't have enough money that the choice knowledged that she was working for the work of she did that she was working for deploying.
And they walked to 5,5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worker was pretty to double, to double,
So a lot of choice can work work with a lot of choice.
And I think the world world that looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make very much to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundancing funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lamely of us shake the lamely of our distribute and chose finally less tevilized the result of the resultances are as we had less option.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the dressings, the choice, the choice,
You would have been such a case, for that another choice would have been better better.
This is dreamed alternative alternative world that you get spired of your choice.
And does break on the following of the choice that you have made that you made a good choice that you were made choice.
The more options there are the easier to be easier to have the spired of understanding of the element of the crazy option.
A second reason has with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave from morning to the true of things that we leave the value of things that we depended up with the things that we can be comparing.
If you can think of many alternatives you can think of the alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you walk to you.
That makes you have less tevace with the alternative that you chose have chose to you have less teve.
One example. For the non-New Yorkers understand you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of this example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a fun. They have a fun.
They are at a beautiful strand. No human beautiful beach.
Do can not be be? "Fordikie" thinks that man, "It's auggan.
Everybody in Manhattan is the city of Manhattan is the city of my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of Manhattan is the city of Manhattan is the city of Manhattan is the city of my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city true.
I could flat my car flat the door."
And he is too simply simply with the idea that he was that he wonderful every day parking a great parking place of mislegal parking place.
Substitutions are going to be costed to be done of the entire we of our choices that we have from our choices of choice.
The more possibilities, the more attractives alternatives are there.
And that presenting to us as substitution costs.
Another example.
This pictures to a number of points.
Life in the here and now for example, and you don't have to be considered to be fairly to the things that you don't have to be considered to be failed things in the here, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and for example, and you have to be able to be able to be failed in the here and for ex
Another thing is that you can excise with every choices excise.
And all that other has been so been so productive that the chose option is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this during my quest to a new basically brow.
I always wirely always speed brow.
Because it was only one kind of speed bought you and it bought you did it. It was not unbelieve, it was incredibly incomfortable, but if you were the broken the brown of the break of the OK.
After years I went to the store for a new thing.
I said, "That's my me, I want to say a distriple brow.
And the real said, "Will you fit easy fit easy fit easy fit easy?
Do you know whether you whether you whether you were stone-washed?
Do you want a single with snak-effect?
You know, you know, walk a little bit expensive pipel." And so he went down." And so he went down."
I was speak of the same thing. And I was saying, "I want to say, "I want to wonder the only brow.
He had no idea which was that was, and so I have a long all the possible brows all the possible brows of all the possible browing browing all the possible brows of all the possible browing browing up to every hours had no
And I think it's honest, I left the store of the wink of a bit of a bit of basically browing brow.
I had better done it was better to do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To explain? To explained me a book.
The reason I didn't feel better felt with all this choice was that I started to expect more of the fastonger brow.
I started without any expectation, because I knew one.
Then turned out there were different and one of that would be a different of that would be fast.
What I bought was well, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I mean, my break with my break with my basically tol.
The more opportunities have people have discovered to be the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less texts, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketingpeople don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In really going to be about the way in the real goes down in the real goes in the real goes about it.
Everything was better when everything was doing was better when everything.
Because when everything was bad people could have experienced experiences have been surprisings.
In our modern society can we expect as a citizens of citizens of citizens but the best thing we can reach one is so good as we had expected as we had to do it.
Never we become surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torious --
The secret of happiness -- this is not too much of happiness -- the secret of happiness.
I want to stop here -- I want to say -- a car, a car biographically elemental -- I married with a woman who actually is fantastic fantastic is.
I didn't have me with less text.
But with less enough are dealing his good cans.
And finally, you know, when you buy a bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad as one kind of front of the front of you can ask wonder, you can ask wonder, why you are inteve.
The answer is that case, simple.
The world is responsible of the world you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, you buy a lot of different bits that turns out to fall the time, who is the responsible of different bit?
The answer is just as simple. That's as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decision as people decision of those decision of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves real.
In the Western society society depression under the younger generations highly high generations are highly tool.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression of depression and suicide is that people have so often teleurbances have been so often because of their high experiences.
And if they try to explanation for themselves to explanation for themselves to explanation, they show themselves the descene.
So the net is that we came out of objective that we spoken on the fast, but our bad bad of this, but our bad usin.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody for where you get to be taken to be touch.
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't seem to choice better than not can choose better than it is not automatically that is more choice, but not encountered more choices
There's a magical boundary of choice possibilities. I don't know.
But I know that we have been produced for for long time, that choice for choice for a long time.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready ready -- a principle that we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best thing that we can keep us the best of the best thing that we can keep the best of the best of the best of the best thing that we can keep us
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material fairly fluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier to the problem is not so much choice is too much choice is too much choice is to be a lot of choice.
So the paradox that I'm talking about here with the fashion that I talk about the modern, wheeling West.
That's frustrating and said to this, Steve Levitt has been told that expensive and difficult to installing kids not help kids understanding of your money.
I say the same through this dun, complicated choices -- they don't help it. Erger thing. Erger is a slight of damage.
They make us live fewer life.
If a part of what people in our society in our society of those choices were making to countries that people have to have been put on the field of those people have to go into the field of those people go on it.
And we would go out of our lifetime, well, would go on the forward.
That's what economists call an Pareto-in-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution of prosperity, not only poor people -- and that is by the last of choice that we set with our measure that we set with our measure that we set to use.
And finally, when you read this imagine, you would read this imagine humans say, "Ah, what does that fis?
Nothing is possible in a fis."
A writical imagination, a short-global global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it is that this fish I start better to be deal smart.
Because in fact, this is what you hand: If you put the fish to create possibilities, you don't have freedom, but paralysical paralyming.
If you came the fish to create possibilities, you get less text less text.
It leads to more amazing and less text.
Everybody needs a fish to count.
This is a certainly certainly -- even for the fish for the fish for us.
But the absence of a figured figured to ask is asking for cases, to ask wrong -- unheily.
Thank you for your attention.
