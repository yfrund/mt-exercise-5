Last year I showed these two dias to show that the polar cap, which was the pollished the pollished three million years of the U.S.
But this distinctive problem because it shows of this specific problem because it didn't show the ice of the ice.
The ice capita on the North Pole, in a sense of climate heart of our global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crinter and crincluding in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what happens is happened 25 years is happened 25 years of what happened 25 years of the last 25 years of what happened is happened to slide of what happened to do is happening is a version of what happened to be the next slide.
The permanent ice is dived in red.
As you can see it from the dark blued.
That's the year, which is the equired at the winter.
And it crins in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or older is almost like blood, which is almost like flowing the body here.
In 25 years of this to this is going to this to this way.
And that's a problem because the free because the free of the Northern Icelebrate and there's a very large amount and there's a very large amount of free carbon cool carbon methane, when it is designed in methane.
And so, the referty of the tribution in the atmosphere, that would double animate, that could double the cornal point of the corn.
In some of the deep any of the moment, in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
For Katey winter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another undeep more.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is fairly we will be able to be
A reason for that, is that this huge warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell of smell of through that.

These streams are flights.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, which is the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And the last month scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly quickly on the smelt of the smelt of a single underwaters.
The whole continent is for six feet of foot is sea legs of foot as Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massa, there are now new now, who were a few years ago, which were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting the half of his drinking water from that smelt of that smelt time.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappears, it disappears to the drink water.
In California was there was a 40 percent in California in the snowpage of the Sierra.
It comes in the waterres in the waterres.
And as you could ream the predictions are navastigated.
This global dreams dreams has led to a dramatic stycump of forest fire.
And the number of natural of natural and never have a lot of crazy and never never seen fast.
Four time in the last 30 years of the last 30 years in the prevent 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years of we have 70 million tons of course, we added every 24 hours --
25 mifive mixes of every day in our oceans, Look at the east area of the Stille arean arean, from America, west, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dragges in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is designed to design foximated for 20 percent monits of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stepped the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extenceds to China.
And there was a lot of more stepping cool cutting choal.
But we see a curry.
These are the cutting carbon cutting the building was annuleaving in the last year and where green alternatives were presented to the years, and where green alternatives were presented to the break of the building became presented in the last carbon the broad.
There's a political fight-fight on the country.
The steone carbon and oil industire gaves of 250 million dollars to promotly clean, which is a clear cutting clearning is a counternity.
And that picture me to think about something like that.
And Rond was the Christ, in Tennessee, about four billion galler cutting home of the billion galls to believe.
You probably have seen the news face.
This is the one after the largest of the biggest disincluding in America.
This is happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising carbon the left cool left around the Ker's Stors was thing.

That's the reason why the most important thing is to give us to a gigantic again, to give to the light and the letting of the light and the realm of the true of true cool.

We find that it's clean is -- and it still leaster another lead.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me go to us over.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cutty clean cuttch.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of lawn.
But that's the sound of sound of songs clean cutting cool.

The red wire of all these things are our dependency of fossil fuel of fossil fuels, like puile colls, and inported oil.
But now there is a certain new solution to get this.
And before America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 percent clean.
A plan to get America to work America to work that safe us, and the heating of the Earth is the Earth of the Earth.
And eventually a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontde.
Al Gore: And the last stread.

Stem: Repower America. Time to be realist.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking quickly, "If you want to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to do it.
If you want to go far far and you get together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a hope about how that works.
So I am here. For those who didn't have anything about that, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever in the case of the biggest scientific experiment in the one.
It has to be the circumstances that were present less than a billion of a billion after the universe to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambition, sus!
This is the machine under Gengine.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of the mini-breaks. And this is the one that I work within diame, 22 meter in diameter.
Spectacular photo from ATLAS in a building so that you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That care in the controlling in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the way around the LHC should be around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and pieces in the detector of the LHC, in the detector stream.
In other words, when we saw that picture picture on 10 September we had that the machine worked, which is a huge overwin.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of this, or then, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page of the internet page of it.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden decided to the gold of these golden deceek.
And they read the machine of 13 thousand amper reflect of the machine was full power on full power to the full of the machine of the bears of the machine of the machine of the machine of the machine of the machine on the full of the machine on full being full of the machine of the before they were full in full following full of the full of the follow.
The engineers are going to say, "Not that are too small of you. They are too small the time."
They can do that because they can do that because they superceived on whole low-temperaturs.
So on mulled 271 degrees of the stars, the might between the stars, which are dragonflects.
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructific.
And that was the wire of it was something that was there was a electrical weather than anything that was 13 thousand amper reflects.
This was the results.
This is another impressive, if you realize that magnets more than 20 tons of tons and they were about 30 centimeters of the tools were going to move in the field of far.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of it.
We all have them all tools of them tool.
Now they are back to the road.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will put it again, and we expect it in Juni, so that we can go further as we can go to the except what the buildings of the universe is the building of the universe
Now, of course, of course, have that unfortunate the value of scientific research. It's easy research. It's easy to work on the value.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard is that it's so hard that we go further, the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist per Humphrey Davy, did I did the decease of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers of his teacher's learning Michael Faraday, this is that there are so dangerous than to take our images of human beings are not a mysteries of human beings in natural nature designs of the define of the world, and completely designs are insions of the world that there are no mysters of the designs of the ded of the ded thing for the bly defice designs of the bs of the bs of the brifine world of the designers of the designs of the ble of the world of the reak of the ded thing for the rea
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your childhood to your childhood and when you play with blocks.
When you discovered how to go to the born, they opped and awareness and aware your deal with the teaching of the depended by the depended with and depents of space relations.
Ruimtely insight is strong because of the world to understand used to understand us.
If a information -- what if you have an information by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advises with my advise Pattion and my member Jee Kalanithi -- what if we used a computer -- what if we used a computer music, in place as a kind of digital fingers that information as a kind of digital desick on a plate desh of information that we could put information with a set of digital figure breastrify information that we can fulling information flase with a so-fult of information of information fulational fulational fult of fult of fult of information fult of information of information of information that one of figureastation
and can orders and as we want to be able to orders and can we have to be able to orders and can be able to orders and orders can be able and orders and orders can we want to loce?
And this question of this question that we decided to look for a answer building the building of Siftables.
Siftype is a Sifta of interactive computer in the size of a cookie.
They can be able to be far with the hand they can be able to each other, their movement and they have a screen and they put a screen and wire contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traded by understanding of blocks to understand by understand by understand in the fix.
And so the tables are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And so that these tools have a more physical different of the movement and even have been conscious of their movement, and even of the way we move them move, there are different new and fun interactions of the new and fun interactions and fun interactions of the so.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifty Sift-institute to be a video is to play and othersice played and others played and others played played and played on the back of the back of the reference,
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And then they will be place each other, they will be interesting.
If they are real, they are also remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to realize this, and they can also figure.
And they feel much movement and helling.
We realize that we realize that one of the interesting consequences of the interaction, the usbars is barn of the break of a color as it was a fluence.
In this example, three Siftables for the examples, and I can use them to go to set color in a leg, where they are being mixed to be collected to them.
And if we have gotten we gotten three we go,
There are some cleleless capabilities for education, made plays, mazines with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people to things fast fast, and the result of the case of the middle of the education.
And here's the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci of a simple calculator.
Here's a game that we show a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every single letter to get in every Siftable, and formed words are controlled in a words, and freclearned in a work of work.
And after about 30 seconds is the really reshaped and shaps a new series of letters with a new series of letters with using opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am them to try and make it try and make a video of it.
They were really real away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly nearly don't need instructions that people need to have instructions of this applications.
And everything you have to say, "Make words" and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the other people at the test of the other people at the time.
That's our young bone, right-tester, rightsup.
And it seems that he seems to the Siftable.
For him was just this blocks.
Here's a interactive paintings of interactive painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can be new characters in the scene of the Sift brings, by the Sift of the table.
He let me come up the sun of the sun of coming up here.
Video: The Sun up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done any! Yeah!
By shaker shape of Siftables and the next to each others he can respond to each others with each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decisions how it decisions.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: the last example that I will show that I will show you that is a synthesizer and live music that we have developed to have developed a sound produces that every Siftable, like the leaad, bass and drum.
One has been four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
These sound in the sounds can be injected in Siftables so that you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the atterns of a leg-Sift of a legs effects are live controllably as reverb and filter.
They are being a sound and added and added by cancering and addressed by cancering
And then, the general effects like tempo and volume to be pattern.
Let's look at a second.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a lot of lead.
And now I place the basline --
Video: Well, I feed some bagglassulfood.
Video: That's going on the filter on the drums, so that I can filter the effect of live live influence.
Video: I can do it all the way from the side of the tempo blocks.
Video: Well, I headlet the filter on the basas for what more expression.
Video: I can rearn the pattern of the playing.
So I don't have to plann, but I can improvise it all the way I want to improvise, it getting a lot of it.
And at finally finally the dims of the end, by the volume Siftable to the left so.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make my passion from new people-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brains and lighing.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of possibilities with some of the capabilities that we are to the developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the attack is just a whole new generation to the interact with digital media for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to go to you all with you with you all of you to all of you.
I'm writing write.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I am all of writing and I don't think that will ever change to change that is going to change
And yet there is something that happened in my life and careers in my life, and career, which I had my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work again.
It started a book that I written unning a book that I written a memoire, "Ets, Biddle, that is very solid to my first work and a international stator.
The result is that people are all over the case and always that I have to be called me and always like I was doing it.
Worly, where -- you know, does --
People come to me and ask me and ask to me and ask to me, "Don't you never bang you can never ever ever event?
Don't you afraid you don't keep your entire life but never keep is never going to write that people will write to be hearing in the way?
Don't you get there?"
And you know, tribute.
Of course, that would be very much that would be a smell that I was crum 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- if I told that I wanted to be a teently --
People said, "Don't you never faster that you will never be success of you will never get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be success?
Don't you afraid for dediction, you will go on through it is going to go through it.
Don't you afraid you don't have to be your life on this work without that there is ever coming out of the breakes of your broken droams on the bitters of falen?"
Something in that strets.
And in the short comes to the answer on that questions of this question: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afafraid for all those things that are being called
Always of it.
But I also have a lot of other things that you don't want to know that all of it.
For sea bweak of sea and other one things that are things like that.
But what is writing writing myself the last time where that fear is fear of the fears that fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to the work for the work for the work for work to their opinion on Earth?
What's so particularly about creative processes that we worry to make us to make the effects of it on the mindnessarily of the work of work work on the work of all.
And I think of my father. He was clail engineer, and I don't remember that there was a working in the 40 years that he was working on the work for for for for it.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No, it didn't work about it.
And to be fair fair of engineers have been crazy by the centuries, also they didn't have the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
And so, that have this kind of reputation.
Not just writers just writers have been reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of other creative people have become instable.
Look at the griming of the griming of the most magnificances of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own own to do through own the own of own young,
And even those those who don't have suicide no suicide of their gaves are going to be obvious to be obvious.
In the last interview of his deaded said, Norman Mailer: "Meach of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit about your life work.
But of these kind of spoke we don't look more up.
And we all have heard it all before, and we heard it all before.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity of the subject is to connected to suffering that a artist-eventually leads to ellen an artist,
So why do I want to ask everybody today: can you with that idea lives?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it is that I think about the whole is not a prety thought of the thing that is all the way at all.
I think it is the reflect of the reflect.
And also another dangerous.
I won't like to see that this century that this century is going to be that this century.
We can create creative minds much better to live better to live better.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, would be dangerous to that dark thought to that dark thought to that dark thought of the dark of thought that it would be a dangerous to live to that dark thought that dark thought that it would be done for me, in my situation, and I know that dark thought that
And seen the fase where my careers now in my careers now is now.
Go only after that, I'm young, amper of the year.
I can work maybe I can work four decade of decade.
And highest probably will be seen what's going to I'll have to get another through the outside work that is a work that following book.
We're friends up with friends of each other, so I can slap you know, highest my biggest success of behind me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you go to think, you're going to be able to you know the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me song with the work that I love with the work that I love with the work where I love on the work of where I love with the work that I love with the work of where I love with the work that I love with the work where I love love with the work where I love with the work of where I love from the work of where I love with the work where I love with the work of where
The question is, "Hoot?"
And after a long after a long time I can go to the conclusion as I can describe if I build a psychological protection in the process inbuilding in the process of inbuilding in the process of the process of inbuilding that I can think about the process of the process of the process of inbuilding as I think about the process of the process of concl
I have to write a safe distance safe and my governments between myself and my governments of understand my future for the reactions on my future publishing in my future.
I have shown it last year to ways to ways that we do it.
I have been down in the history and have me floors in other civilizations to see if others have found credibly a better way to help creative people to help create creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My search has been breated to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was not a creativity of themselves.
And they believe that creativity was a good mind was a good spirit was a good spirit was a lot of course and unknowledges to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these tremendous minds of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demp who had a demp that he had a lot of words.
The Romeins had a species had a species of squartery idea.
And they called a geniused to be called a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius,
In their promise was a genius, a kind of magical entities that are opped in the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the house.
And if the artist was work was the genius,
And he gave shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's precisely the distance that I talked about the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work is going to be work in his work.
The artism was so in protect of protect to protect much narcism.
If you brilliant was bread, you didn't have all the edge of the edge of the edge.
Everybody knew that a knew that you had holpiece.
Well, you know, you work up work on you, that not just you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent.
Long time is that been creativity that had been creativity to be creative.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed and everything changed
There is a whole new idea: the individual human is the individual human is the universe and mysterific and mysterions.
No space for mystical creatures, attackage from the divine world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual.
And for the first time in history was about artists of artists were said that they were a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I have to be a big wrong.
And to one person, one person, one person, one individual individual that he or she or she or she is the cumber of everything is the essentially mystery, of everything is to figure out of everything is to a fragile human psyche.
And as if you ask someone ask the Sun in the Sun,
Egos are blowing up to a gigantic proportions and there are imposed to presty expectations of prestations to prestate prestations of prestations to prestate it.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists has made it.
If that's so what I think is that I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different this?
Can we understand back on a parently understanding between the relationship between the relations?
Maybe not maybe not --
Wellight we can imagined 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes,
Probably in the audience of people who reflect tools have been talking about the idea that equal pursus of the feeding of the feeding of the work of artists of artists to inspiring heights of the work of artists of artists of artists in the audiences of the business.
It doesn't seem me that I will have you all of that in the moment.
I ask it question I wonder it.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that thought that thought that thought of the mind?
It was just as much as much as much of the explanations of the totally calculators to decided that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit of something has been trying to create something -- so in fact that the creative process here -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process is rational behave.
That sometimes it feels that feels feels that feels feels that almost paranormal.
I've been been recently, the great American closer Ruth Stone met met met
She is close in the nine. Her whole life write they close to be close to the close of it.
She told me about her running on Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field, she heard a poem coming to the country.
It was, so said, she said, also, as if there was a big waves came up with a big waves.
Some poem poem poem about the country to her her.
She felt that the ground of her feet, and she felt that the moment and knew that her on that moment only one thing for her life.
And she followed by the close and she had to go and see she had to get so quickly and paper and paper and pick up and see paper and pick up and see paper and piece.
When the close was close of close was that her only came that her only to write it.
Sometimes she didn't fast.
And then rening and rening and render, but reached it doesn't the house.
And in the moments of close to her her shot of her heal, on the fields, in her words -- in her words -- to another close -- to another closer --
And also there were a myself -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that she close to almost mist.
And then she was in house in the search and paper and pieces and pieces it by her it.
Juist at that moment she had a pencil of pence.
And with her other hand, so told me she poems it was close to the sky.
She picked up with his tail and pulled it back in her body, and she wrote the written --
In those cases came the case came in the case of paper and all of paper and came up in the case order.
When I heard that I heard -- what happens to be my credible of created my creative process of creative process of it.
And so my creative process of my creative process not! I don't have medium!
I'm a micle-mile, which every day on the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans with blood, sweating and trans through the same time.
But even in that daily swoods I've got a little experience.
You will also know the myself also feeling that feeling that feeling that feeling you can can identify from a source that you can can identify --
What is that they have to do that?
How can we use it without that we are going to be crazy?
And in a way that we have good for us?
The best contemporaine example, that I can think I have a musician, Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life had been showed of the calculators of the case artist that has been trying to get to the unite of the unition impulse of creative impulses that have been pushed in him.
With the 190s, I was a little bit of Tom that was a smooth.
And one day he reflected in Los Angeles over the fast, and changed the process of radical.
And as he reflected to this barragmental of a melodie.
The decided that it is doing that failed that we'll do it understand the corn.
It was a nice nice and he wanted to show it was a lot of womin.
But that went doesn't do that.
He had no paper tye, no table, no table, no tanty paper of them.
The made exciting exciting exciting exciting the melody of the melody and then it turns me to the melody eught to the back of the eught family of the same exciting excited to the melody of the m
I'm not good enough, I can't do it right."
He didn't real real in panic, but he stopped that whole process and did something news.
He looked at the sky and said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sky?"
"Do you really think I can be able to be a song of you can cross?
If you really want to get that this song of song, you have to get another one of time, if I have time.
And so, not, you know, someone else did someone else difficult --
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohently from the process of the process of the process of very,
The work itself is the same thing that is the same thing that is familiar underto.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him disappeared to the create of genius.
The genion sat him on the skin and liver skin and liver the skin and currently close to the skin and liver --
And to realized, there was no reason that there was no reason through to go through it.
It could be a wonderful, bizarre cooperation between a conversation between Tom and the own aspect that didn't really have all of Tom was that not all the way from Tom was a myself.
That story has changed my way of working.
I've been a little bit of cat.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddy, Biddly.
And at a crazy of moment I in despair.
You know, you know, you know, you don't want to get to well, and you don't think it's a terrible ramp rammp of bad. The bad book ever book.
Not six, it's really bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad of bad bad bad bad bad.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of the project of the project of the project of the project all the project of the project of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom those who was a smooth and I decided to be a point to a point of attempt to be a point to be a point of attempt to be a point to his genius.
I went me from my manuscritics and directed me to a lot of camer's room of the room of the room of the room.
And I said, "Listen through this, we know everybody is not just through this book is not just through me.
You can see that I have all in the stop I have in the stop I have in me
I don't want to give you this.
If you find that it have to do better can, you have to do this.
Stape? Do you don't know that right, right?
I just write through because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notults are going to be disagree that is just a differenceed."
Tja--- United the way -- it's the way --
Euwing came up in the North African African desert people to sacged to dance anything to do with sacred music.
And then and hours and hours and hours and flock to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were full professionals.
But sometime, very single happened to be something that happened to be something like that.
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know, you know, what I mean, you know, you have also seen you in this thing that I mean, you know, you know, you have a performer.
It was like the time still and the dance of the time and the dance of step.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights of everything together.
And suddenly it empty not seemed only a human being.
In him, under him, under him, fired it.
A divage fired fired him.
And if you did happened to kill people what it was happening was Dan they started claps and call the corn, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
Because that was for them.
By the way, a fun fact that you say, "When the Moren South South South South Span, they were broad.
The quote is the centuried by the centuries, and the story of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah," in "OK, olone."
And that hear you today in the day in the day in fights, and flamengodances.
If a artist in Spanish does something impossible is doing to say, "Allah, old one, Allah, old one, Allah, bravo."
One of understand se, sice: a glimp of God.
Precions what we need.
Lastil is the dance that the dance of the next morning that he discovered on dinctions that he discovered on the morning charge is not a diviece of the morning charge more discovered charge more he's done more it doesn't discovered.
And at that moment is he is a little bit of the older man with depends that may never may be more to zulk to zull through the high of high man before.
Maybe never going to have anybody anybody God on the dances of his dance.
What do he has to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to square to show for a creative mind.
But so painful is not need to be it doesn't have to be able to be the same down.
Imagine you don't have to do that the most unusual aspects of your person coming from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have a while, you know, she was a while,
When you get there with you, they are ready to someone else, they are supposed to someone else.
And so couldn't considered everything.
I hold inside that thought of thought that though.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside is going to be a lot of reach that is to get a lot of reach to a lot of reach to a lot of reach to a book that is a lot of reach that is going to get inside of a book that is going to get inside of a book that is going to be a lot of working on a book that is going to be able to get in
The follower of that illuster progress.
If my thought to me the same thing with me hold me to the same before -- you don't have any fast. See doesn't fright.
Do you just get your work.
You just do this, what it is also it is.
If the task is to dance, dance.
And if the divine geniused to be decision to decision to the work on one of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful sour
Thank you not, thance down through that.
And also then, "OK!"
I believe that heart.
"Ole any!" how anyway, because we pure human loved and own wisdom by still human loved plooters.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole
You know, I have a few of these projects, and I have some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean, and discovered from genes.
We started to go from a new point: we were the biology of the digitize of digitize and now we try to go from that digital code from that digital code to a new phases in biology in biology and synthetic designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" And is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand on different level on different level of level of the since of biologists --
We have tried to get different approaches of the approaches to minimum components.
We're now 20 years of the digitize of digitize
When we have sequenced, the human genome sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology world of the computer.
Now, are we try to ask for life, can we live to regenerate new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of a kind of a that can be mulse in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look at a nonce that we can come to a non-smaller genome.
We can have in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or of the 500 or so, which are there are here.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively relatively with the onze.
Belief me, this is simple.
But when we look at all of the genes that we can look at per piece, it's very improbably improbably that this would be a living cell.
We decided that the only room that the only route prevalue to synthetic so that we could have the components to synthetic so that we could the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started to asking questions are also, "Can we started a chromosome synthetic synthetic
Stains the chemistry the chemistry of the major molecules that we never see?
And, if we can do that, can be a chromosphere?
A chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemical inercise material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accelerating exponential wise.
Our capability to write the genetic code of writing -- but is generately to be a lot of slowing --
And our last point would be at this moment would be at this moment curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of couple of corn, to start with a bio-ethic tools of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that makes DNA makes 30 to 50 lettters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer of the piece of thousands of it.
So we had to do a new method to the small pieces of these little pieces and corrigerating all the mistakes.
And this was our first poggetting the digital information of the genome Phi X,
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the fresh correction.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the time, we started a piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria stop, and the bacteria of genetic code and viral particles are going to make the genetic code and viral particles --
The viral particles were locking of the cells, they came from the cells, they came back after that, and deaths the E. coli.
I was unclear in speak with the oil industry, and I said that they have model but all the capital.
They laughing over you.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which the software building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes in cassettttes of viruses, so that we could varians cassettttes of virus,
to understand what the real components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very accuraft.
When we first currently in 1995 was the standard in 1995, the standard per 10,000 basepars.
And finally we found after we resequencing after 30 mistakes. If we had used to use the original sequence.
And part of the design of the design of pieces that have to be 50 letters long that have to read the fires of 50 letters to build the smaller smaller of the smaller that we have to design so they can go to together.
We designing designs of this.
Maybe you have read that we read in stopped watermers in stop.
And this: we have a square genetic code: A, Gode: A, Gen and T.
Trios of those letters of letters for 20 aminos-a-clear any clearning for each ozero-sourre.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, they thought of thought.
And then we only called the corned only myself.
Some of them were calls that there were no close to have a close of close
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eath them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they put and they put them and in each other.
And we started pieces of the pieces that five to 7,000 letters were longs, long, and pieces that were to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 724,000.
In each stadium we could have a flot of these pieces of pieces so that we could sequences because we want to create a process that is going to be very robust -- that's going to be very robust -- that's going to be straking.
We try to reach the point of automatization to reach the point of automatiz.
So this looks like a basketbal.
Once we come to the really large pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow in E.
And that reason the experience of all the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to rade in other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that we were called homologe that is used by the biology to repairs of DNA to repairs of DNA pieces of the bags can feet.
Here's one example of that.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiation to radiation on the radiation of radiation to radiation on the radiodurans that we can.
You can see that in the top panel, so, chromosome, so, chromosomes just from each other.
12 obvious later, he put it again, it was such as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely opiniled.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can life in space that can be existing can be existing the environment, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been showing that there is a lot of of of that there's a lot of of there.
Here's a real microphere, of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- fact that we have just gist-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did them in
And it's made that they feeds them automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a nordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing we outside unless we expect to the tribute of the recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of people, with people, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would present it with a 10-points letter, without spations, there is 142 pages only to pressured the genetic code of the genetic code away.
Good, how do we started a chromosome? How do we activate it?
With a virus is a clearly easy easily.
With a bacteria is much complicated this.
It's also simpler if you have a little bit of eukaryots, as we just wis: you know, you know, you know, you know, and that's what you know is just the cell.
And in the bacteria of chromosphere, the chromosphere, but we have long the cell, but we have a full transplant that we have a full transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosly to another, and it can activate a chromosplant to another, and active.
We have a chromosome. We have a chromosly of a microbs.
These are about so far of each other as people and micked mous as people and micro-micle.
We add some extra little bit of extra for this chromosome.
We have the deved with enzymes to make all the protein all of the eds.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very advanced graphic images -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought that he would come to show that we were trying to develop the process of what we are going to be develop.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of chromosome, we found a second chromosome, which they have third of third of thousands of properties in one time of the species.
People who are evolution to imagine evolution to change a lot of biology has not a lot of biology and regards.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzyms who are actually taking DNA resh of the reflect.
The chromosome, that chromosome, there was no one of the cell that didn't ever ever eve.
The cell -- the chromosome, that we stop in -- well,
It was expressive, and the recognize, and the other chromosome, and the other chromosome, and therefore it all the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared all the characteristics of one species of the one species of the new species, and he changed on the new species, and changed on the new software that we stopped in the celebrate.
All of the protein changed the membrans -- when we read the genetic code was exactly in which it was changed.
This may be clines like genomical alchemistry, but we are in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Well, I've been paid before that this is not a creation -- this is a lot of tribes on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have paid that maybe we may be a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambric explosion design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's free clearly free if you look at what it is.
We're going to go from six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years that will be there are four being
We have a lot of food, with food, with cleaning water, medicine burning the six-and-half billion.
That is a dister to do that for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of colles, more than 30 billion of five oil.
That's 100 milos fates a day.
When we have biological processes in ogencous process than anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere that carbon dioxide of that carbon dioxide of that carbon dioxide of course that carbon dioxide of cue that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosing in the atmosp
And though our world's discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had just been a dozen various components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of that.
We're pretty reserved by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now technologies are now she's faster synthesia to do combination as called combination to do called combination to do this.
We've got the capability to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot can make a million chrobot of chrobotts.
If you think about the processing of 20 million different genes or produces to optimize processes to produce octan, or medicine, new vaccines, we can produce with a small team biology change, we can change more molecular biology than in science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life vatability, chemical or fired production, vaccines production, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen imafic picture, design where we work on the corn, and that you can really go to the ggest and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see.
We know how their genetic code of how their genetic code of it.
We focus on fourth generation now we focus on the fourth generations.
And in the ethanol of you see, just a bad experiment.
We have second second and third generation of fuel that will come inside of the fuel like sugar, to more higer fuel as more higher fuel as the moment of butanol.
But the only way we think biology that biology have biology without the food-price higher and the availability is to reduce as we start to CO2 as we start with CO2 as his foods, and therefore that we have the first same foods, and we think that we are burning the first foods of the first square burning generation within the fires of fires of frite burning breas.
Sollight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovered all kinds of discovered all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea -- about 2.5 kilometers of cooking hot temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 hole hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the time, if we can take celeasily via pipelinated by the pips of fability to fability to fability to fuel this process.
So in a short time we think we are in a short of time, we are able to break out of the basic question: "What's life?"
We have real, you know, we have -- you have the purpose to replace the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this, what do you do?
A important energy source of energy source of energy source energy source energy source of energy source energy source of energy source energy source energy source energy source energy source is going to be a major energy source energy source energy source energy source of energy source is become a major of energy.
But we also use to the work of these tools to think about faster series of vaccines to think about fast.
And this year was the flu -- we walking something behind the facts of the facts of the reflect on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by being combined vaccines of being combines
Here's how you can see how the future of the future, is the evolutionbombal tree is going to change with synthetic bacteria, and evolution with synthess, and eventually eukaryota.
We're also far from people.
Our goal is to sure that we make a chance of making that we make a long enough to survive that may to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology is fundament of a new technology that we have to do to Microsoft brasoft about a year ago. This is Seddragon. This is Seddragon.
And it's a environment in which you can get local or on the immense of visual data.
We pick up here, many gigabytes of digital images and can be down here, and examples, navigate and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of term and the sort of terms of closely of here.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at the big, how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapi.
It all doesn't matter because the only thing that would be the only thing that would be influences on a thorigins of system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of the picture data.
This is the graute by Dickens. Every colum is a headdition is a heads.
And to prove that it's really too, and it's really typically not imagine, we can do something that is really done that this is really text isn't imagine.
Maybe this is a little bit of weird way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is an example.
Every great image is the beginning of a part of the bottom of a part.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine, which also is actually a scale medium is actually a scale medium is a scale medium is a scale medium is actually a scale medium medium.
We also have done something that we have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising a lot of resolution -- much higher than a normal adverty advertising information -- and we have extra information information -- and we have extra lot of advertisising advertising of a normade of advertising advertisising advertising a normade of advertis
If you want to see the capacity of these car is you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really do that we can really do that we can do the limits of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through flaure.
Of course, of country for the hand maps of country to a technology like this, I will not spent time to this field, except that we can contribute this fiely much more contribute to this field.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
And then put up on the top, on the top,
Let's look at something else.
This is a marry now on the Web, you can look at the Web;
This project called Photosynth, who connected two techniques of the connect of the connect Photosynth,
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision of Washington, proventure at the University of Washington, and the streton of Washington, and the device of Washington,
and Rick Smare with Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have been closely to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of stability -- and all these things are stability and all these things are space things are space well.
I don't know sure or there's time there's time another time is to show you other environments.
There are more space there are more space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we work -- to work -- to the communicate of the communics of this technique, in my head of the environments on our website on our website.
We had to stop the advoces of the advoces of advoces.
This is a reconstruction of the Notry Damps with images from Flickr. You can just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-to-shirts, and the campus and the campus and such the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the corners of the
And each of these orange chains are part of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the model of this model of the foot of the same of the breakfroom of this model of model in this model of the each of the every single of the model of this model of the birds of the breaks.
And so these are all Flickr images that are all of Flickr piled to be copped in this way.
And we can close on simple of simple wise navigers.
I had never thought I had thought I would ever work at Microsoft of Microsoft of the soft of the things that I would have ever work.
It's overwhelming here.
I believe that these are types of cameras are cameras everything from good to mirror to mirror flex, a big number of them, address in this environment.
I'll try to try some strange images.
There are so much of it is so much deaths and such the subjects and such the such of the faces and the such of the faces and so much of the faces and there's the seen and so much of the faces and such of the faces of through faces and the such of through faces and through faces and such the such of through faces and so there are so much busy to be there are so much.
And the whole between this is even a series of pictures -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notry Dame, that is also good chain the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can say that we can do things with the social environment. This uses now the data -- of the whole collective memory of hunty of hypice of huntly, the Earth -- and buy that everything on each other.
All these pictures are going to be a very larger than the same thing is a bigger than the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth is the earth of the Earth.
See this as a confish on Stephen Lawler's work on Stphen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work and a follower work on Stephen work on Stephen to Stephen to the work of this is a fultarth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses to be used to the benefits for the people who used it.
Their own pictures are being metaphor-data who have someone else invoted someone else of the being someone else of the tape.
And if someone would like someone would like to attack and their names, and they are invoues and their names, my picture of the Notre Dase Day's going to be able to the data, and I can use that metaph, which metaphold to that metaph, which metace, used of everyone's a kind of cross-modal, and create a kind of crossal, and creating social experience.
And of course, is the type product of this immentary model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from airy photos, satellite images and other applications of the collective and other applications is also far from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what made your software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are particularly on the world can get to the world together?
BA: Yeah. What's going to discover is discovered.
The create creates to your wishyperlinks between pictures.
And it does that based on the data in the pictures.
And that designed when you think about the richdom of semantic information that is a lot of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look for the web for the web for images, you feel a search of the purpose and the text on the web page of what the image.
What if now that imagination is all your pimages of your picture?
And then the number of the number of the number of things and the amount of wealth that comes from that, which is going to be gigantic. It's a networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredible incredibly incredible incredibly incredible.
One of the intense pleasure and of eating and research is the opportunity to live between them to live between them who are still feeling the old wind their past, which are still feeling their pasts, the bitters of bits in bits bloaders.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky still kills or the myths of Infairly with meaning with meaning to the myths of Infly, or that in the Himalaya bood's boodhist on the breathm of Dharma, you remember is ready drives of anthropology in the world in which we live in a bad of the world in a absolute of the world is not a model of the world of the booms of the world of the world in the myth.
And the consequences of a set of set of choices that made our ancestors ago.
Naturally, we all share the same tacks, the same tacts of the same types of the world.
We all make increase all of increase down thrites.
And so, because of the deavastication of the death.
So it can't be surprise that we are all of the dances and art art and art art of art that we have all have through to have the art of all of the art that we have all have through to have all of the art of surprise.
But interesting is the unique cadancadancadancy and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to the Penan in the walking on Borneo, or the Vood-acoliian acoliian in Haiti, or the fight in North Kaisut-bary in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the Caravanserai in the Sahara. -- this is the man with a month of the sky mail of the holang-basically read Que-mama,
Everest, the god-mother of the world.
They are all us to learn us to be different to think of otherwise can think we have to be different to orient orient from the Earth.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.
And they shape the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her is just as important as the biological life web is as the biological life.
This cultural life web you can imagine your imagine as a edition as a eedness of eeds.
The eater of the corn, you can defines as the totally of all the thought, dreams, mythes, mythes, ideas and intuitions that are breaging, inspirations that are basically intuits that are business of our consciousness.
The eater is the big nalatency of humanity.
She's the symbol of all that we are and we can be able and we can be surprise that we can be amazing news to the sociated of the animal.
like the biosphere is the free of the biosphere is that each -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would take that least the half of all species on the point of all the species of the species of extinctimes, because that's not what is true.
And the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood comes in the neighborhood scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of of that is loss of of the last indicator of this is loss of the loss of of this.
And then everybody had been born of the same thousand languages on Earth.
A language is more than her words, or her grammmatic rules.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the vehicle of the sick of every unique culture the material world.
And every language is a noud, a distinctic spiritual point, a ecosystem of spiritual opportunity.
And from those sixth of sixth languages today is fluenced in the day of that is flistened in children fluenceed.
They are not longer babies are not longer attacks.
Effective means that means is a change that they are dead.
Is there something that is a single of the aid of tool, the last of your people, the last of your people, the last of the wisdom of the before the wisdom of the children or the rewards?
Precies that terrifice is someone's a good state every two weeks of the every two weeks of the earth, because every two weeks of the last learn least.
Some of you say, "Well, the world are not better place if we all are the same language of the same language of the same language of Super, let's take Kantonees.
Or Kogi." You can realize you realize how it would not be your own language.
So what I want to do is actually going to take you on today is going to take you on a short journey of what is in fact, which has to lost a little bit of what in fact,

It's independent area. They are all the groundary results.
It's a amazing example of how a national example of how a national ength of her people can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly at least for who in the world is requires of the world is required that she doesn't really far away away from the world is actually not far away away away to the world is actually not very far all the way to the world is require, at least for who's clear to these home hold is that they are doing to these home down to these utes.
They are someone's someone's someone.
They are going to be able to put the human imagination, which is going to go back to the beginning of time. And for all of us will be the dreams of these children, just as that of the unclean, part of a lot of hope.

We make a lot of fold to the edness of the correctly, with our public, to the same cultural places, where the true of which is reflect to what he sees reflect by what he sees hopefully, so that they hope to the anthropology that this world is going to be in different opens in different ways that world in different in different ways that we can find in a multural and live in a multure, and live of a multural world and in a multure,
where all the wisdom of all the wisdom of the follock of us being well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some of the questions that I have a book of declass that I've been defenced.
Maybe you can see parallels with information of other sources.
I also such a little bit of a little bit of that you may have mistististry.
I want to start the "official dogma."
And to be precisely to be precisely of all the Western se, industrialized society.
And that official dogma as following as follows like follows on the highest level of our citizens on the highest level as possible to give them so much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a great is a great deal of the human existence, part of the human exist.
And so freedom is freedom to reach own to reach a higher cutt-free to the higher shows of third without of third without of this.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom in that people have more freedom
And more freedom means of freedom is more free fairly more free
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would have been during on the society.
And also in our lives is this dogma cumber crashed of the corn.
I'll give you some examples, I'll give you some examples.
This is my supermarket. A middle.
And the thing about dressing.
And almost of that 175 can-certain 175 can-virgs in my supermarket of extra-virgin my supermarket and develope and different balsamics and developed balsamics are regular.
And that was that you can do the number of dressings for the case of the case of you don't have anything between 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can stroneoset of states -- aoud speakers, cassettespecier, cassettespecier, cassettespecier, radiverster.
And so one electronics that one electronics you can choose out of this attack.
You can see see, you can see se-half million different systems with parts of that middle of that moment of the store.
Give too -- you have a lot of chain.
Anybody -- communication.
When I was going to was young ago, you could all sorts of course, you know, you know, only have to ask for Ma Bell.
You don't she went to be able to be you crye.
And that had a piece of the advantage that it never happened to be a piece of this.
That time is pretty time.

Wellight you have this model in the wine, but you can see there is a little bit of inside that happens to be certainly happening.
And the follow: people come to the wine, and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobill that didn't do it.
And also in aspects of life that are much more important than the attack of choices of choices of choices of choices a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the United States so that you have to do to the doctor, and you told you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do that, we can do that.
A has this pretty and took them on the other.
And then this predicts. What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Dokter, what finds you?"
And the doctor, "An this other, this other, and the capture and capture this predicts.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you way, if you was me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you don't say."
And that we call that we call the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact that the heavy of decision of decision of the decision of things -- the doctor, someone who has been certainly one who has been certainly sick and not the best condition to decisions -- the patient. For on recept of free memiddle medices are meedices that is getting made a lot of results of clines are medical of the barraineds,
Good properly sleep that ners, because the goal, you can't buy and I don't buy them.
Why makes you can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctable, to ask that other markable.
And our identity, y-identity, y-fidentity, is now over-fidentity, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity, our identity, is the result of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want to just want to leave ourselves.
And every morning in the morning of what you want to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage of marriage.
There's been a time that free that free everybody of the car that you could have so quick as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quick
The only real choice was wrong with whether and what you did did did was not when and what you did did did
Now, free is free everything for the opens.
I give lesson that I give lesson that I had developed a developed percent less housework at less house,
They are not dam, dominating or the line of time.
No, they have the choices with choices.
"Well, I say, whether not? Well, I now?
Or I will I wait? Or the children, or a career?"
These are all the way of questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, also if this means that they don't have all their homework and therefore of that, and therefore not a good cutting.
And they have right. They're right. They are important life.
And then we come up with work. Carl gave just gave that technology is to work at that points us every minute of every day, where in the world -- except in Randolph How -- except in Randolph How --
There's a marry one place, which I like WiFi the do, where WiFi the doing.
I don't want to sleep because I want to keep for member,
But anything that is a huge choice of work in that we are going to be in that we are going to work on the time, or we go to work on the time, or now.
We can look at a footbalwing bary of our son the one side, and our Blackberry on the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all get out of standing of the type of that competition with all kinds of question: "Well, you know, "Well, I think this phone call kinds of topy?
And I write on this emailt responsi? And I write writer?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is experienced the football wedest of our son a very different way.
What we also look at the small, the small, materialistic bags, lifestyle: lifestyle: lifestyle.
And so the world early saw the world early looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now is looking at the world now.
The question is nowing or bad or bad or bad of bad or bad or bad of bad.
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad is bad about it.
Those huge choice has two effects, two effects of the human.
A very opposed effect is that it before it before the locks of works than completely
And so many choice as much choice as much choice to make a choice of choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigate in free of investiguous pensioently.
A colleaguard of me got to investment data of Vanguard, a big pollutty invited society of the society of a work of working about one million of working about 2,000 stigations.
They found that for every one of the before every 10 percent fundressed the worker bottom, the participath two percent aftername.
And we did fifty fundred 10 percent less works, within five five five five funds. Why?
Because it in fifty fifty is to choose that people are just to choose the choice to the next day, and that are the next day, and that are there, and that are doing that.
And from extension is coming down.
That doesn't mean that only that people after their pensioner pensioned to eat because they don't have a dream because they don't have a dream of choice that she was working in the fairly as it was working on the work of she was working together.
And that was that they love to 5,000 dollars a year on their neus to go on their nose before to go to their neup.
The worker was a namely to double, to double.
So in the freedom can work a lot of choice can work on the freedom of choice.
And I think the world of that the world looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to get the right choice makes the right choice makes right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost, as we had the lost, as we have the lost, and eventually less tevilized with the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of us as we had had been less options as we had learn to be less options
There are multiple of reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, for example, in the back of the choice was not perfectly that the choice didn't perfect perfectly that the choice was that the choice of the choice of that,
You straight in such case that would have been better.
And this reasonable alternative alternatives that you have to get from your choice.
And speak on the choice of the choice that you have made the choice that you have a good choice.
And the more options of the core of easier to have the core of the crazy of every early every element of the corner of the crazy.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
Dan Gilbert gave from morning of how often we depended up the value of the things that we are compared them.
If you can alternatives in many alternatives all of the alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you destroy distribute to you deceive.
That makes you have less tevact with the alternative.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretched of this example.
This is a barray on vaimportons.
They have a expensive second a second wound.
They are a beautiful strand. Straling weather.
Beter can't be able to that? "Fardik," thinks that man, "It's aughty."
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I could have my car for the door, for the door."
And he is too simply simply that he was going to be every day that he walked every day parking mislesses.
Substitution cost of the full of the full that we have from our choice of choice that we have a great choice.
And the more opportunities are more possibilities are alternative.
And those presents, and those presents us as substitution.
And one example.
This pictures of a number of points.
Life in the here and now and now that you don't have to go.
And one thing is that you have a point of choices of choices.
And all that other has been so been attractives that the coses, which is option to the resources are resulty attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this during my search, I came to a new break came to a new busek.
I always said to always speak to the break of it.
And the only one of the kind of spired to bought you and that bought you did it. The pagest totally didn't income, but if you had the break of the broek and often the broek of enough and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough the room OK.
After years I went to the wink for a new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to get a spiremainek, this is my makes me."
And the mall said, "Wilt you fit -- you know, easy fit or relaxed to relaxed fit?
Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have stone-wetness or acid-washed?
Well, you know, you know, you know, effect?
Will you have something expensive piled or flass." And so he went pipile." And so he just go.
I was spease. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to head.
He had no idea which was that was a break that was and so I have a long break of all the possible broeks of pass.
And I mean, I left the winel of the winel that I came up with a business of pass of pass pass the break of the break of the break of the break of the break of the break of the break of a break pass of pas
I had a better done it better of those capabilities I could do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? And so I wrote this on myself, I written a book.
The reason I didn't feeling better freedom, was that I started more expected to expect the smell rock of the good speek.
I started without any expectation, because I just just one kind of speek of the speek of it.
And then it turned out that there were different and one of that would be a vast perfects.
What I bought was good but not perfect.
And so I was going to my break with my break with my expectations, and that straight me --
And the more opportunities people have have to have more opportunits of the deserves of those capabilities.
And that means that people are less texts, with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know.
Because in that case I don't know what I'm talking about.
In really the way it is going to be about it.
And everything was better when everything was better at was all better.
Because when everything was bad of people could have pretty surprising experiences.
In our modern society of society of citizens of citizens of citizens, but the best what we can achieve ever expected as we had been expected as we had expected to expect as we had expected to expect the best thing that we can reach ex
Never before we are surprised to be surprised to be my expectations, torent.

But with less enough of the good cans.
And finally, why you can get a bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad bad as one kind of flocks as one kind of fast, you can ask you very questions.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible -- you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breaks, and you buy to fall, and you buy to fall, who is the responsible of the responsible of different bit?
The answer that is just as simple. That's as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break to fail.
So if people decisions, even if people decisions are good to be good to be good of those decisions of the choice.
And they take themselves themselves themselves --
In the Western society of clinical depression under the younger generations.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosive today of depression and self-moder, is that people have been television of the sky of the sky experiences.
And if they are trying to exploration for themselves to self, they are the decided to explore themselves the deced.
So the nettoresultate is that we have objective that we have been talking about being ond to be bad bad of it.
Some a small of a society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody for where is is is taken to where you have to be taken to be able to be able to be able to reverse to everybody for everybody to get everybody for where is taken taumes.
But that's not.
It doesn't have a drive that can choose better than you can't choos; it doesn't follows more choice that is more choice is more choice is more choice is more choice is more choice that is more choice better than you can choose more choice that is more choose more choices than that.
There's a magic borders of choice. And I don't know.
But I know that we already long the point that choice is that choice is device.
Now there is a principle -- I'm going to ready -- a principle where we can like the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of best of the best of best of the best of that we can like the best thing that we can like the best of the best thing that we can like the best of the best of the best of best of the best of best -- I am almost of
The choice in industrialized countries are coming from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, there's been heard about before, where the problem is not so much choice is too much choice is to be choice.
And the paradox I speak to the moderdern I was going to the modern Wests.
That's frustrating, and that is frustrating and you have yesterday that you care yesterday and distide the children and distide children. Sum of your money.
I say the same thing about this dive, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they didn't help anyway. Erger is a so.
They make us live less worth.
And as a part of what people in our society of the choices to make all those choices were being ded to countries that people have to have lock to the barrain, life of those people are going to be pretty on prevent of those people in the presentation of the people in our society of the people in our society
And our lives would be going to be going to be going to go on on on it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wonderful, not just poor people -- and that comes through the choice that we measurafe that we measure.
And finally, if you read this picture, you know, if you ready this picture, as a developed humans say, "Ach, what does you know?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A writal imagination, a short-image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the time I started better understanding that this fish is smarts.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you the fish to create possibilities, you don't have freedom, but didn't freedom, you don't have freedom, but paralysing.
If you the fish to create possibilities to create less your break to the break of the fish.
It leads to more paralyzing and less texts.
Everybody needs a fish of fish.
This is free to concerned -- it's possible to be even for the fish, but for us.
But the same way of a figured figure, is asking for capital, difficult to be disaping,
Thank you for your attention.
