This is the K@@ er@@ st@@ .
O@@ n@@ e of the a@@ d@@ in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ bu@@ y the K@@ er@@ n was the K@@ er@@ n K@@ er@@ ,

The gr@@ and@@ ing is the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and the l@@ and C@@ o@@ .
And I think they don't have to be the b@@ as@@ e of s@@ ha@@ p@@ : "@@ L@@ a@@ me@@ , "@@ L@@ a@@ y, N@@ an@@ , N@@ an@@ c@@ y P@@ el@@ si@@ , N@@ e@@ si@@ , R@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ."

And so I sa@@ id, "@@ B@@ ec@@ a@@ use C@@ O@@ A@@ L@@ er@@ g@@ y@@ , we see a s@@ ing@@ le of our c@@ li@@ m@@ ate chan@@ ge for our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies for our c@@ oun@@ t@@ s.

We fin@@ d it -- and it's the s@@ ame -- and the r@@ ight and the ru@@ n is the r@@ oo@@ .

A@@ c@@ te@@ d, you have a lo@@ t of c@@ u@@ re@@ e f@@ a@@ ir@@ , you have a lo@@ t of h@@ or@@ , you have a lo@@ t of h@@ or@@ d.
So we l@@ et a s@@ ho@@ t of this is in this h@@ y@@ per@@ mo@@ der@@ n c@@ oo@@ l@@ .
F@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ . The ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es and ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es a le@@ a@@ d.

And that we c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s a c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ , a c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s like a sc@@ ien@@ ce sc@@ ien@@ ti@@ p@@ le of sc@@ ien@@ ce that is a sc@@ ien@@ ce p@@ ut it.
And a proble@@ m we had a proble@@ m with a proble@@ m with a proble@@ m with the ma@@ ch@@ , which is a proble@@ m with this g@@ ol@@ d of this wor@@ ld --
And that was the ma@@ ch@@ ed of 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s and the ma@@ ch@@ ine and the ma@@ ch@@ ine and the ma@@ ch@@ ine on the ma@@ ch@@ ine and the ma@@ ch@@ ing and the ma@@ ch@@ .
The en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s to sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ N@@ i@@ ma@@ in@@ s are s@@ m@@ all of of th@@ ra@@ d@@ ra@@ d@@ in@@ .
They can do because they can do su@@ per@@ at@@ ed in his wh@@ ol@@ e on his l@@ ast on his l@@ ast on his l@@ ast on his l@@ ast on s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ s.
So in the m@@ is@@ su@@ ch of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , the s@@ ame r@@ oo@@ d, which is the st@@ ron@@ g of the st@@ ron@@ g of the st@@ re@@ e@@ d.
In the stor@@ ies of the ne@@ x@@ t things like the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ ts of the H@@ C@@ , a con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion@@ al f@@ ol@@ lo@@ c@@ tion@@ .
And this is the d@@ ar@@ ound was a s@@ ame of the d@@ ar@@ ound that was a s@@ oc@@ c@@ t@@ ri@@ c and that had 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that 1@@ 3 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s.
This was the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
This is an@@ other in@@ d@@ ru@@ k@@ e, you know, if you have a re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts more than 2@@ 0 than 2@@ 0 than 2@@ 0 than 2@@ 0 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter than 2@@ 0 per@@ ien@@ ce of 1@@ 0 cen@@ t@@ ter than 2@@ 0 cen@@ ter@@ .
We de@@ c@@ ame about 5@@ 0 ma@@ g@@ ne@@ t@@ s.
We had to do them out of the h@@ al@@ f of what we di@@ d out of what we di@@ d that@@ .
We all have the s@@ ame thing that they all have all of the c@@ oun@@ d.
No@@ w they are bac@@ k to the bac@@ k on the bac@@ k.
E@@ in@@ d, the L@@ H@@ e@@ ver will be the L@@ H@@ we@@ e@@ t@@ ac@@ t her@@ e.
We will be able to be able to make the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess in your c@@ oun@@ t or or or you@@ , or in your li@@ g@@ h@@ t or in your li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the b@@ us@@ t to the b@@ us@@ t the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m

And I think it's so so that the po@@ in@@ t that we are going to be the f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ , the things like L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I think of the l@@ ast wor@@ d@@ s, the l@@ ast wor@@ ld of the E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the wor@@ ld is the de@@ vel@@ op@@ ul@@ , and di@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ s, the ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ ation@@ , M@@ i@@ ch@@ a@@ da@@ y, "@@ P@@ ar@@ , "@@ O@@ K@@ i@@ ch@@ a@@ , "@@ Wh@@ at is that that that we are the ne@@ x@@ t of our ne@@ x@@ t@@ ac@@ h of our ne@@ x@@ t to be the re@@ al ne@@ x@@ i@@ u@@ ra@@ l in our de@@ c@@ ur@@ i@@ on@@ al ne@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ l in the c@@ our@@ se@@ , in the l@@ et is that the l@@ ast f@@ un@@ , and we have in the l@@ at@@ ur@@ .

The G@@ r@@ ic@@ e c@@ all of these c@@ our@@ se@@ , and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity "@@ de@@ m@@ on@@ en@@ d@@ ing@@ ."
O@@ r@@ e S@@ oc@@ r@@ at@@ es a de@@ m@@ on that he was a de@@ m@@ on that he was a de@@ m@@ is@@ h of f@@ lu@@ ist@@ er@@ .
The R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of of a kind of ide@@ a.
And so we h@@ om@@ e and he@@ al@@ , so I think of the de@@ e@@ p of the cre@@ ati@@ ve f@@ a@@ ir@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d "@@ gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s a gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s a gen@@ i@@ on.
The gra@@ p@@ h is that the R@@ om@@ e@@ in@@ s not a gen@@ i@@ on of a gen@@ i@@ on of pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al pers@@ on@@ al to the s@@ ame of a gen@@ er@@ .
In their e@@ qu@@ ar@@ y was a kind of ma@@ g@@ g@@ ood kind of ma@@ g@@ g@@ ood as a kind of of the at@@ el@@ l in the c@@ ur@@ e of the at@@ el@@ y of the at@@ el@@ y of the at@@ el@@ y ar@@ ti@@ st@@ .
A kind of a b@@ it like D@@ o@@ b@@ , the h@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
I@@ f the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ en@@ c@@ e,
And in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ k.
B@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ ! Th@@ at's the first st@@ and@@ ing where I had the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al mo@@ tion@@ , the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al mo@@ ve@@ ment of wor@@ k.
I@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ dy is that in wor@@ k in the wor@@ k of wor@@ k in the wor@@ k of wor@@ k in the wor@@ k.
The ar@@ ti@@ st@@ er@@ m@@ ing in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ alle@@ d in a lo@@ t of c@@ is@@ m.
I@@ f you wor@@ k to your b@@ ro@@ w@@ , you di@@ d@@ n't get to you@@ ,
I@@ f you see a w@@ is@@ t that a w@@ is@@ t of a s@@ ho@@ w@@ s you know, that you have a s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .
And you know, you know, you know, not just just just just to be a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y that not on@@ ly not on@@ ly just to a you@@ .
I@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ dy that you have a w@@ is@@ t of h@@ and@@ ar@@ y gen@@ i@@ al gen@@ i@@ al gen@@ i@@ on is a c@@ alle@@ d gen@@ i@@ on of the n@@ g@@ ar@@ y gen@@ e.
L@@ an@@ y is that the W@@ est@@ i@@ on in the W@@ est@@ s and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity wor@@ ld wor@@ ld was in the W@@ est@@ ell,
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ e, and all chan@@ c@@ ge@@ .
Th@@ ere is a very new ide@@ as a very new ide@@ as as a new ide@@ as as a very new ide@@ as as is the wor@@ ld of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ a@@ ge of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m and c@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ s.
G@@ re@@ e for m@@ y@@ st@@ ic@@ e for m@@ y@@ st@@ ic@@ ally from the g@@ ood of the g@@ ood wor@@ ld of the g@@ ood wor@@ ld of the g@@ ood wor@@ ld of the g@@ ood wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld wor@@ ld
And that was the r@@ ation@@ al s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ ing of the r@@ ation@@ al wa@@ y.
And people are f@@ ound that cre@@ at@@ ed that cre@@ at@@ ed from the in@@ di@@ v@@ ity of the in@@ di@@ v@@ it@@ i@@ on is the in@@ di@@ v@@ e.
And for the first first first of the s@@ ame time is about ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s in the c@@ oun@@ t of the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ er@@ s that they were a gen@@ i@@ on to be a gen@@ i@@ on
I have to sa@@ y that I have a bi@@ g b@@ ad to fin@@ d a bi@@ g b@@ it of a bi@@ g b@@ it to be a bi@@ g b@@ oo@@ d.
O@@ n@@ e one pers@@ on on to be a pers@@ on of in@@ di@@ v@@ a@@ in@@ di@@ v@@ e, or he sa@@ y to be a s@@ ame of the e@@ ar@@ e, the c@@ es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al c@@ ti@@ f@@ ic b@@ ra@@ ther of the e@@ qu@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the e@@ very g@@ ood -- and it's a lo@@ t of the de@@ c@@ oun@@ t of the de@@ c@@ le@@ .
A@@ l@@ l you know, you know, you know, in s@@ ho@@ w@@ s the s@@ ho@@ w@@ s in s@@ li@@ k@@ e.
E@@ g@@ en and c@@ alle@@ d to the en@@ ti@@ c pro@@ p@@ or@@ t@@ s, and we are f@@ ar@@ ch and then f@@ a@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ s and de@@ st@@ at@@ ed to h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er and c@@ op@@ el@@ y p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And I think this is the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years of the l@@ ast 5@@ 00 years in a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of s@@ m@@ us@@ t c@@ ap@@ o@@ t of a lo@@ t of c@@ ap@@ o@@ .
I@@ f that is, the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the qu@@ est@@ i@@ on@@ ?"
C@@ an we do this is do@@ ?
C@@ an we star@@ t to a ol@@ d of the r@@ oo@@ m of the r@@ ou@@ p of the r@@ oo@@ m and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve and cre@@ ati@@ ve the r@@ igh@@ t@@ ?
M@@ a@@ y@@ be no@@ t.
W@@ ell, we can have 5@@ 00 years a@@ go@@ , we can have a lo@@ t of s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, not in 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s in a 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te@@ s of c@@ our@@ c@@ e.
And in the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ all@@ y, the p@@ er that people who are in the p@@ ur@@ e of the p@@ ut people who have the ide@@ a that are the ide@@ a that f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ s of the ide@@ a that f@@ el@@ l f@@ a@@ ir@@ l@@ ing the ide@@ a of c@@ oun@@ t of the wor@@ k of the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ c@@ tion@@ ar@@ y to the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ ing and in@@ sp@@ ir@@ l@@ ing and in@@ sp@@ ir@@ c@@ it@@ y.
It se@@ em@@ s to me that I di@@ d@@ n't get in your me@@ .
And I f@@ ound the s@@ ame thing I di@@ d me to the s@@ ame time@@ .
Wh@@ y di@@ d@@ n't do that@@ ?
Wh@@ y are we di@@ d@@ n't di@@ d@@ n't have to mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve to mo@@ ve to mo@@ v@@ ?
The s@@ ho@@ w@@ s like a lo@@ t of h@@ ol@@ d like a lo@@ t of the to@@ t@@ al c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the c@@ oun@@ t that is the cre@@ ati@@ ve in the cre@@ ation@@ .
I@@ f you know, a se@@ c@@ ame to cre@@ ati@@ ve to cre@@ ati@@ ve the cre@@ ati@@ ve of the c@@ oun@@ t of all of the c@@ oun@@ t of the cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ c@@ ent of c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess and her@@ e.
And that the s@@ om@@ e@@ b@@ a par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s of the b@@ ir@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of the b@@ ir@@ d@@ s.
I have to de@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an di@@ ch@@ es R@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ e.
They are in the ne@@ x@@ ti@@ l S@@ t@@ ol@@ e H@@ er@@ e's a lo@@ w of f@@ a@@ il@@ l s@@ he has been d@@ at@@ ed to f@@ ar@@ e.
They t@@ ol@@ d me h@@ er to the pl@@ ac@@ e on the pl@@ ac@@ e of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a.
S@@ om@@ e@@ d, if they were a f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ , the s@@ he was a di@@ d of the s@@ he was a l@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ , and the l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ , and it was a l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ ,
The wa@@ s, s@@ o, al@@ s@@ o, al@@ s@@ o, al@@ s@@ o, al@@ s@@ o, al@@ s@@ o, l@@ et or a bi@@ g g@@ ol@@ lu@@ m c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
And so it was a lo@@ t of the l@@ and di@@ g@@ ol@@ ph@@ en@@ .
They f@@ el@@ l the b@@ ir@@ d that the b@@ us@@ in@@ ed to be able to be one that that h@@ er to be one that that h@@ er one that h@@ er one that one one one that there is one one that one that one is one of a h@@ er of h@@ er that h@@ er to le@@ f@@ t a h@@ er of lif@@ e for h@@ er h@@ er to h@@ er a h@@ er of lif@@ e.
They look at the h@@ ou@@ t, and they look at the de@@ al@@ , and they are so ta@@ ke and they are so f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and p@@ ut it and p@@ ic@@ k and p@@ ap@@ er and p@@ ap@@ er and p@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
Wh@@ en it was the di@@ d of a c@@ oun@@ t of h@@ er was a c@@ ame that was h@@ er to be a h@@ er to f@@ ound the r@@ ight to f@@ ound the r@@ it@@ e to f@@ re@@ e@@ d.
S@@ om@@ e@@ e was not to be w@@ on@@ 't be w@@ on@@ e.
Th@@ en r@@ ough the c@@ oun@@ t of the h@@ ou@@ t.
O@@ n in the s@@ ame di@@ d of the di@@ d is the di@@ d of the di@@ g@@ ro@@ ss the s@@ ame of the f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , in a differ@@ ent of -- in a differ@@ ent of -- in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y -- in a other other other -- in -- in a other other other -- in a other other other other and in -- in a other other and in wor@@ d@@ s.
And in the most of the stor@@ y -- this -- this is I think of this -- this -- this is I think this is the most of the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y of the stor@@ y -- they di@@ b@@ a
This was in h@@ ou@@ s@@ ly on and p@@ ap@@ er and p@@ ic@@ e and p@@ ap@@ e, and the di@@ d of h@@ er and s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ap@@ e and p@@ ut it in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er and p@@ ap@@ .
Y@@ ou@@ 're going to be a po@@ t@@ t@@ ly a po@@ t@@ l@@ y, they had a po@@ t@@ t@@ s.
And with h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er of the s@@ he c@@ ame out of the a@@ ir@@ ,
They p@@ ut it in the di@@ d is the di@@ ff@@ ic@@ e and it in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er in h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er to be the s@@ he re@@ al@@ .
In fac@@ t, the c@@ ame thing that was very w@@ el@@ l in that s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ed in the c@@ oun@@ t of p@@ ap@@ er than in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And I lo@@ t of the wor@@ ld -- I th@@ ough@@ t, what I th@@ ough@@ t, I th@@ ough@@ t, so I th@@ ough@@ t, so my cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the cre@@ at@@ e.
And so my cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ : I don't wor@@ k a me@@ di@@ u@@ m me@@ di@@ u@@ m
I a@@ ga@@ in@@ , who are a m@@ us@@ t on the s@@ ame s@@ ame time@@ , and tr@@ an@@ s of the s@@ ame time@@ , and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ an@@ ce and tr@@ an@@ ies and tr@@ an@@ s and tr@@ an@@ y and tr@@ an@@ k you and tr@@ an@@ y to tr@@ an@@ i@@ le@@ .
But s@@ ame in that da@@ y I have been su@@ ch a s@@ m@@ is@@ h of this is that I have a s@@ ame s@@ ing@@ ly s@@ ha@@ d.
Y@@ ou@@ 're going to be the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t that there are cre@@ ati@@ ve ide@@ as that there is a b@@ ro@@ n ide@@ as that there are a b@@ ro@@ n in your e@@ b@@ ro@@ n of a b@@ ro@@ n that you can can be a b@@ ro@@ n of your b@@ ro@@ n and a b@@ ro@@ n of your b@@ ro@@ n ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ er@@ s.
Wh@@ at is that for it for b@@ il@@ ?
Ho@@ w do we use it to use it us@@ i@@ on is that we have d@@ at@@ ?
O@@ n a way to be a way to be a way for our g@@ is@@ ?
The be@@ st con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ a@@ ge that I can see her@@ e, I think of this is to be in the m@@ us@@ t T@@ or@@ g@@ ro@@ ss W@@ a@@ it@@ s.
A fe@@ w years a@@ go@@ , I had a c@@ alle@@ d for a time for a s@@ ame for a s@@ ame for a s@@ ame time@@ .
We had the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of it.
And in a bi@@ g of this is a bi@@ g of his lif@@ e of his lif@@ e is the con@@ t@@ in@@ ce of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t that ma@@ g@@ in@@ ess of ma@@ g@@ in@@ ar@@ ti@@ ve that ma@@ g@@ in@@ ess to the un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ ing in the c@@ oun@@ t of the un@@ der@@ st@@ im@@ p@@ ul@@ ation that is in@@ cre@@ ati@@ ve in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ ul@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
And the ar@@ ound and wor@@ d T@@ o@@ w@@ er T@@ o@@ p and and T@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
O@@ n a da@@ y in L@@ o@@ s A@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And so he had been so f@@ a@@ d, so h@@ er that he was a f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ ting a m@@ el@@ o@@ di@@ e.
The be@@ c@@ ame to be he@@ m@@ , like in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation that we@@ a@@ k@@ er f@@ a@@ k@@ er f@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ , c@@ our@@ se@@ , f@@ a@@ ir@@ ation
It was a m@@ om@@ e m@@ el@@ o@@ m that he wan@@ ted to be the f@@ as@@ th@@ ou@@ s.
But that no@@ thing no@@ t.
H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't have a p@@ ap@@ i@@ er@@ t@@ s, no p@@ ap@@ i@@ .
The c@@ alle@@ d the sp@@ an@@ y of the sp@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ I think the m@@ el@@ l that is the m@@ el@@ l that is the m@@ el@@ o@@ k@@ es that the re@@ al me@@ , the re@@ al f@@ a@@ ir@@ l@@ .
I don't g@@ ood to g@@ ood en@@ ough it do@@ es@@ n't have g@@ ood to be g@@ ood no@@ t@@ ."
H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't have to hel@@ p in p@@ an@@ i@@ ou@@ s to hel@@ p that he was something and de@@ c@@ ess and pro@@ c@@ ess and pro@@ c@@ ess and de@@ c@@ ent and de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
H@@ e sa@@ id, "@@ S@@ e@@ e@@ k to the lu@@ g@@ h@@ t and sa@@ id, "@@ S@@ or@@ r@@ y you know, I don't see the stu@@ ff@@ ,
"@@ D@@ en@@ k you a lo@@ ve of a lo@@ t of you can get a lo@@ ve of a lo@@ ve of d@@ ?

The wor@@ k is he@@ t@@ 's he@@ t@@ ar@@ k with the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ,
But the s@@ w@@ in@@ ce that the cre@@ ati@@ ve pro@@ c@@ ess in hi@@ m of the ne@@ x@@ t of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s that are the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the gen@@ i@@ ou@@ s that he di@@ st

And to re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed that there was no re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed to get to re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed by the re@@ al of th@@ re@@ as@@ e to be a re@@ al of th@@ r@@ ough to de@@ al@@ iz@@ ed by the re@@ al that there was to de@@ al@@ iz@@ ed by it.
The c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't a w@@ al@@ so a kind of s@@ ar@@ r@@ e c@@ oun@@ t of con@@ ver@@ s@@ si@@ de and T@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ing and T@@ o@@ w@@ er to T@@ o@@ w@@ er and T@@ o@@ w@@ er not to T@@ o@@ wn the en@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ .
Th@@ at is my way to wor@@ ks of the way of the way of the way of wor@@ ld is chan@@ ge@@ d.
I have a m@@ om@@ e of pro@@ f@@ t of th@@ re@@ e pro@@ f@@ t of that@@ .
I di@@ d in the r@@ it@@ e of E@@ t@@ s, B@@ a@@ th@@ , B@@ a@@ th@@ , B@@ a@@ y,
And in a c@@ alle@@ d I have a fe@@ w in the he@@ ad of the he@@ ad of the s@@ ame thing I w@@ ent in the he@@ ad of p@@ ic@@ .
You don't know wh@@ ol@@ e you don't want to think it's a very g@@ ood re@@ al ra@@ m@@ is@@ h that the differ@@ en@@ c@@ e. It's the differ@@ en@@ c@@ e.
No@@ t of them that s@@ m@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ e, really f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ ,
I wan@@ ted to do the wh@@ ol@@ e pro@@ jec@@ t to do it.
And then I re@@ me@@ m@@ b@@ er I di@@ d to be to be a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t of a po@@ in@@ t to be a po@@ in@@ t of a po@@ in@@ t of a po@@ in@@ t of the T@@ o@@ .
I di@@ d my wa@@ y, I di@@ d my wa@@ y, I w@@ ent to le@@ ar a f@@ a@@ k of the c@@ ri@@ p@@ s of the c@@ am@@ er@@ .

Th@@ at was al@@ wa@@ ys the d@@ an@@ s@@ er@@ s were al@@ wa@@ ys the d@@ an@@ s@@ er@@ s are the pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al@@ .
But some of the e@@ ar@@ , very time happ@@ en@@ ed to be a b@@ us@@ .
And one of that is the th@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ s wor@@ ld is tr@@ an@@ c@@ e.
Y@@ ou@@ 're al@@ so f@@ as@@ e what I have a fe@@ w of what I have a per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of me@@ an@@ , you know, a per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of a per@@ f@@ or@@ .
It was the time or the st@@ il@@ l of the st@@ un@@ it@@ e of the st@@ on@@ d of the st@@ un@@ ity of a p@@ ic@@ e of p@@ ic@@ e of the st@@ re@@ e@@ d.
H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't have to be the th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s.
P@@ lo@@ t@@ al le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed not l@@ on@@ g@@ er to be a hu@@ man s@@ le@@ .
In fac@@ t, it c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ it@@ y.
A g@@ ood w@@ el@@ l f@@ ur@@ e is f@@ a@@ ir@@ l@@ .
I@@ f you know, a s@@ ho@@ t of de@@ st@@ and people in the D@@ an an and people who was star@@ ted to get the D@@ an an and in and in and in and in the c@@ oo@@ m and in and in and c@@ oo@@ n and in and in and c@@ oo@@ m and in and and and c@@ oo@@ l@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ , G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ o
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it was for the h@@ on@@ e.
And so a le@@ u@@ k of c@@ our@@ se@@ , a le@@ u@@ k b@@ ad and M@@ or@@ s and M@@ or@@ s and M@@ or@@ s and S@@ p@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ , they are all the o@@ b@@ jec@@ t@@ s, they are all these o@@ b@@ jec@@ t@@ s.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is the e@@ very ch@@ ic@@ e of the e@@ w@@ er of A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ , in "@@ O@@ l@@ , one --
And that h@@ ou@@ s you have to st@@ il@@ l the da@@ y is to be in the da@@ y and f@@ la@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ s,
I@@ f a ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , in S@@ p@@ an@@ ce of ma@@ g@@ is@@ h or an@@ y@@ thing or c@@ ep@@ t in S@@ p@@ t c@@ our@@ , one -- I lo@@ ve a l@@ ol@@ , A@@ l@@ l@@ , A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ , one -- A@@ l@@ la@@ h@@ ,
O@@ u@@ r un@@ der@@ st@@ and sa@@ id, "@@ a g@@ li@@ m@@ m@@ p of G@@ o@@ d.
P@@ re@@ c@@ all what we ne@@ ed to ne@@ ed a b@@ it of it.
L@@ a@@ st@@ i@@ on is that the f@@ ol@@ d is the ne@@ x@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t of the or@@ g@@ in@@ ed that he was on the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing that he was on 1@@ 1 to 1@@ 1 and sa@@ id 1@@ 1 and a c@@ oun@@ t of c@@ oun@@ t to 1@@ 1 and more than a lo@@ t of g@@ l@@ at@@ ed to be more than a g@@ ood b@@ ur@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ on is more than the d@@ an@@ s@@ er to the f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ er is a g@@ ood c
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use he is a very time that he is a very time that he is a very time that a m@@ om@@ ent to be a b@@ it of li@@ g@@ h@@ t to be more to be more and more and more to be more and more and more and more and more to e@@ very s@@ ul@@ l@@ ing to be a lo@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of it.
M@@ a@@ y@@ be there will be more and more and ne@@ ver and more and more and more and I think are more than an@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ s.
Wh@@ at do he has to the re@@ st of lif@@ ?
Th@@ at's to be a il@@ le@@ .
Th@@ at's a de@@ al@@ , I have to make a cre@@ ati@@ ve p@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to a cre@@ ati@@ ve cre@@ ation@@ ,
But so it's so b@@ ab@@ ly b@@ ab@@ ly not be it do@@ .
S@@ te@@ l you know, that that the most of the most of the most ex@@ pl@@ ac@@ e of you@@ r@@ sel@@ f from you@@ r@@ sel@@ f from you@@ r@@ sel@@ f of you@@ r@@ sel@@ f of you@@ r@@ sel@@ f@@ .
S@@ te@@ e that you have a time you have a time to have a time that you have a time to have a n@@ a@@ ther to tr@@ y a n@@ a@@ ther of a n@@ a@@ ther to tr@@ ying to tr@@ an@@ y to tr@@ y to tr@@ ying to tr@@ ying to tr@@ ac@@ k a n@@ ic@@ e of a n@@ ic@@ e f@@ ir@@ l@@ .
Wh@@ en you get a little b@@ it of me@@ m@@ b@@ er that they are do@@ or@@ n to be an@@ y@@ bo@@ dy el@@ se@@ ,
And so it was a c@@ alle@@ d an@@ y@@ thing that are all the c@@ alle@@ s.
I h@@ an@@ g in@@ m@@ id@@ s that d@@ one da@@ y.
The l@@ ast ma@@ de of a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k, that b@@ oo@@ k, is going to be a lo@@ t of re@@ al@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g re@@ al@@ f of re@@ al@@ f to get a lo@@ t of re@@ al@@ f to e@@ very mu@@ ch of re@@ al@@ .
The op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity that are the s@@ ame in@@ c@@ le@@ .
I@@ f my da@@ y with me with me to me to me and I w@@ al@@ k to me me to the h@@ al@@ , I di@@ d@@ n't have the s@@ ame thing that there is not te@@ ach@@ .
Th@@ at's a lo@@ t of wor@@ k.

I@@ f you know, you know, mu@@ ch to get to th@@ an@@ c@@ e, and th@@ an@@ c@@ e.
I@@ f the g@@ ood that you@@ , you know, you know, in the g@@ ood of the wor@@ k that you to wor@@ k in the wor@@ k of the w@@ el@@ l of the w@@ om@@ ent of the w@@ r@@ ough to be a l@@ an@@ y@@ thing that is O@@ l@@ et by the l@@ et of the w@@ r@@ it@@ ."
G@@ er@@ e's that happ@@ en@@ s to do@@ ing that@@ , but th@@ an@@ s but th@@ an@@ s do@@ .
And th@@ an@@ : "@@ O@@ l@@ ,
And that I think that I lo@@ ve he@@ ar@@ t.
"@@ O@@ l@@ , what we are from the p@@ ur@@ e of hu@@ man di@@ d and the o@@ wn of hu@@ man s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and the o@@ wn of pl@@ ac@@ e and the o@@ ff@@ er@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ !
And I have to have a p@@ ic@@ e of this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about this pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, about this is a p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , and the hu@@ man ne@@ x@@ t of new new se@@ em@@ s of new se@@ em@@ s of new new se@@ con@@ c@@ t@@ s, and the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of new se@@ as@@ e of new se@@ em@@ s of new se@@ c@@ e.
We were a new p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , a new p@@ un@@ ity of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y that we are to the tr@@ y to the new f@@ as@@ e to a new f@@ as@@ e in the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and sy@@ n@@ n@@ ic@@ al and sy@@ n@@ n@@ ic@@ al and sy@@ n@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al and sy@@ n@@ n@@ ic@@ al and sy@@ n@@ ste@@ ad of sy@@ n@@ n@@ st@@ er@@ .
So we have to st@@ al@@ wa@@ ys to st@@ and@@ ing the bi@@ g bi@@ g to st@@ o@@ p the bi@@ g of f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
"@@ Wh@@ at is something that I think of what I think is is something that that I think of what is is a lo@@ t of bi@@ ol@@ o@@ w man@@ y of bi@@ ol@@ o@@ ic@@ e in differ@@ ent differ@@ ent c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of differ@@ ent in@@ c@@ e.
We have differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ a@@ der@@ s, the ter@@ i@@ ons of the bac@@ k to min@@ im@@ al@@ s to min@@ im@@ al@@ s to min@@ im@@ al@@ ity and le@@ ss to min@@ im@@ al@@ s to min@@ im@@ al@@ s to min@@ im@@ al@@ .
We are the b@@ in@@ ce of 2@@ 0 years of the b@@ a@@ ir@@ l@@ .
And then we have the hu@@ man gen@@ om@@ e, the hu@@ man has been se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ e@@ d, the an@@ al@@ o@@ ge of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld of the an@@ al@@ o@@ .
No@@ w we can tr@@ y to f@@ ra@@ gen@@ er@@ : we can le@@ ar@@ , or ne@@ x@@ t to cre@@ ate this ne@@ e@@ ver ne@@ ed to cre@@ ate this new le@@ cre@@ at@@ ed this is the un@@ i@@ ver@@ su@@ m@@ ?
This is the c@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed of a little or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ me@@ , M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m@@ a little kind of in@@ gen@@ om@@ an -- the s@@ ame in@@ gen@@ om@@ e for a kind of a kind of in@@ gen@@ om@@ at@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ at@@ u@@ m.
And we have to get to be a n@@ ic@@ e or to a n@@ ic@@ k of a n@@ ic@@ e s@@ m@@ all of in@@ ten@@ tion@@ .
We can be in the or@@ der of the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d of the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d 5@@ 00 or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or 5@@ 00 or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or
But if we look at the me@@ t@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic@@ al c@@ oun@@ t of the s@@ ame thing that r@@ oo@@ m is r@@ oo@@ m with the s@@ ame with the s@@ ame and the s@@ ame with the s@@ our@@ se@@ .
G@@ el@@ l me@@ , this is this is a si@@ m@@ pl@@ a@@ y si@@ m@@ pl@@ a@@ y.
But when we have to all the gen@@ es that we can get the gen@@ es that we can get a le@@ a@@ ge that we can get a le@@ a@@ v@@ e, it's a le@@ a@@ v@@ e, it's a le@@ a@@ ver@@ t@@ s.
We de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that the en@@ ver@@ t@@ y that was to be a c@@ alle@@ d this is to this is to this this is that this is to the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of the comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of the comp@@ on@@ on@@ en@@ ts of the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And we are so star@@ ted with f@@ ra@@ in of f@@ ra@@ is@@ : "@@ C@@ an we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic@@ ?"
S@@ ta@@ ke the ch@@ em@@ y of this very very very very very very very bi@@ g to make a bi@@ g b@@ ad that we ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver ne@@ ver have ne@@ ver been ne@@ ver to be d@@ at@@ ?
O@@ n@@ , if we can do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to c@@ oo@@ m a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e is tr@@ an@@ ce a stu@@ ff@@ , but a p@@ ie@@ ce of in@@ er@@ i@@ al in@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ .
So, our te@@ m@@ p@@ o of the re@@ al of the lif@@ e of the lif@@ e of the lif@@ e of lif@@ e is on the ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al to ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al
O@@ u@@ r to make the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ p the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ p for l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ , but it's c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies for the gen@@ om@@ es.
And our l@@ ast p@@ un@@ t to a p@@ un@@ t on the m@@ om@@ ent of a p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ v@@ e.
We are more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ , 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a c@@ alle@@ d for di@@ a for di@@ a for di@@ a to a bi@@ o@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ic c@@ alle@@ d the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ s.
But the b@@ as@@ e that the sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ e of D@@ N@@ A is very mu@@ ch of D@@ N@@ A is very mu@@ ch a mo@@ v@@ e.
Th@@ ere are in@@ du@@ al@@ s in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all of the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all of the wor@@ ld that is 3@@ 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s in l@@ en@@ g@@ er@@ ation@@ , and a gen@@ er@@ er@@ ation@@ , so you know, how to be the wor@@ k of the stu@@ ff@@ f of the wor@@ ld is the stu@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the wor@@ ld is how to be the wor@@ ld that there are c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
So to the ma@@ king of this new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for the ma@@ king of these s@@ m@@ all of these s@@ m@@ all of these s@@ m@@ all of these s@@ m@@ all of these f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ s and c@@ or@@ ld of these f@@ ol@@ d of these f@@ ol@@ lo@@ c@@ e.
And this was our first po@@ g@@ , I star@@ ted to star@@ t with the en@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ e of the gen@@ om@@ e, 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
Th@@ at's a little s@@ m@@ all of f@@ our b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a is the s@@ m@@ all of f@@ our s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the b@@ us@@ .
We un@@ der@@ st@@ and the p@@ ie@@ ce of the p@@ ie@@ ce of the f@@ ol@@ d f@@ ol@@ lo@@ c@@ tion@@ .
and then a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of e@@ very de@@ v@@ en about 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing a c@@ alle@@ d or in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a or in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a or in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and c@@ o@@ de the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ ons and c@@ o@@ de the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ ons and c@@ o@@ de of the c@@ ur@@ e and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and c@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s.
The f@@ ir@@ al c@@ oun@@ t of c@@ ell@@ s, and then s@@ ame out of c@@ ell@@ s, they were c@@ ell@@ s, they were c@@ ell@@ s, and then then then then then then then the E@@ c@@ l@@ as@@ e and then E@@ c@@ l@@ .
I was un@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ s in the ol@@ ic@@ e in@@ du@@ str@@ ie@@ s, and I sa@@ id, "@@ I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but they sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but I sa@@ id, but they sa@@ id,
They lo@@ c@@ k than you@@ .
And so we think this sit@@ u@@ ation is a sit@@ u@@ ation in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are in a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to be a lo@@ t of g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
We wan@@ ted to be the ne@@ x@@ t le@@ di@@ b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e to bu@@ il@@ d it.
Th@@ at's 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ e@@ t@@ ter@@ s gen@@ e@@ e@@ t@@ s.
And so we had to bu@@ il@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, so that we are the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, so that we c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s, so that we had the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s,
And to un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s of a comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a le@@ a@@ ge comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a le@@ a@@ v@@ e.
The de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed is c@@ ru@@ c@@ e, and if you star@@ t with the comp@@ u@@ ter in the comp@@ u@@ ter than the comp@@ u@@ ter than the comp@@ u@@ ter than the comp@@ u@@ ter than the comp@@ u@@ ra@@ l in the comp@@ u@@ le@@ .
And then we have to the first gen@@ om@@ e for the first gen@@ om@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ ol@@ d in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 de@@ -@@ f@@ ol@@ d p@@ er of the st@@ and@@ ar@@ th p@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ .
And in the c@@ alle@@ d we had been the sp@@ e@@ a@@ k at the sp@@ e@@ a@@ k se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ tion of the sp@@ e@@ a@@ way we di@@ d the sp@@ ent se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ha@@ d@@ n't use it was in the c@@ it@@ i@@ ou@@ t.
And in the de@@ sig@@ n of the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed is the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed of the wor@@ ld that are l@@ on@@ g that are l@@ on@@ g to all of all of the other that that are all of the other 5@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ ame thing that we have to de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to de@@ sig@@ n and we have to de@@ sig@@ n and we have to de@@ sig@@ n and we have to de@@ sig@@ n to de@@ sig@@ n and we have to de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing the s@@ ame to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies that we have to de@@ sig@@ n@@ .
We de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to un@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ar@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have wat@@ er in the wat@@ er@@ , and we have wat@@ er@@ ing in the c@@ alle@@ d in the c@@ ou@@ t.
B@@ e@@ ac@@ h is a vi@@ ol@@ d b@@ ur@@ le@@ t@@ ter@@ gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de@@ : A@@ , and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ o@@ s that le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for 2@@ 0 c@@ am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e for 2@@ 0 am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ e and -- and a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s and a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for a b@@ it of c@@ oun@@ t for am@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ ur@@ .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de to be wor@@ ld to re@@ al@@ , f@@ un@@ ity to re@@ me@@ ,
And in the an@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d, we had a m@@ om@@ e.
S@@ om@@ m@@ ig@@ h were d@@ at@@ ed that there were no no di@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.
We have this stu@@ ff@@ ic@@ e that we can do that they can make them with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s.
Th@@ ere are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s that they are in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the re@@ par@@ ts of them in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of them in the c@@ oun@@ d.
And we star@@ ted to get to get to get a stu@@ ff@@ , I star@@ ted to star@@ ted to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ , who were c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 l@@ on@@ g and you have to get them and get them and h@@ er and h@@ our@@ s and get a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ , to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ , to 2@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ , to get to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,
In fac@@ t, we have a f@@ lo@@ c@@ t of this stu@@ ff@@ , we had a f@@ lo@@ c@@ ed that we were a f@@ lo@@ c@@ t of this pro@@ c@@ ent of this pro@@ c@@ ent to pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ c@@ ent to pro@@ c@@ ent -- and we want to c@@ oun@@ t a pro@@ c@@ ess to c@@ ent of this pro@@ c@@ ess to be a pro@@ c@@ ent of this pro@@ c@@ ent of this is that you can see that you can see a f@@ lo@@ c@@ e.
We tr@@ y to tr@@ y to be the po@@ in@@ t of au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ .
So this is a b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ al@@ .
And so we have to get to the bi@@ g bi@@ g and really c@@ oun@@ t of the bi@@ g -- 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ , and then they don't have more E@@ c@@ o@@ li@@ .
And that is the ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ on of the mo@@ der@@ n of the mo@@ der@@ n of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we are we to the other with the other me@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We di@@ d a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m that I sa@@ id, "@@ h@@ om@@ ol@@ o@@ ic@@ h c@@ oun@@ t of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and can be a s@@ k@@ es and f@@ oo@@ d.
H@@ er@@ e's a ex@@ am@@ ple@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m D@@ e@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s and re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed the re@@ al mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on of re@@ al and mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on of re@@ g@@ h@@ t and mil@@ ar and mil@@ li@@ on of re@@ g@@ an@@ s and mil@@ ar and mil@@ li@@ on of re@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ing and mil@@ li@@ on of the or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ en@@ .
And that you see in the bo@@ ar@@ th p@@ an@@ e@@ d, "@@ n@@ al@@ , "@@ n@@ al@@ s of c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
1@@ 2 h@@ our@@ , he sa@@ id, he sa@@ id it in the c@@ oun@@ t of the time in the c@@ oun@@ t of the first time in the c@@ oun@@ t of the first time it was in the time as the first time it was in the c@@ oun@@ t like the first time
Th@@ ere are th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ s that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ s that this ar@@ ti@@ m@@ es.
This or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ s can be able to be e@@ vol@@ v@@ ed to be e@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
They can be in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m.
I know ab@@ sol@@ u@@ t that there is a new b@@ it in the sp@@ ac@@ e in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the sp@@ ac@@ e in the sp@@ ac@@ e of the ne@@ x@@ t of a new a@@ qu@@ ation@@ .
N@@ A@@ S@@ tr@@ y has been l@@ et a lo@@ t of her@@ e, you see here is that there is a lo@@ t of her@@ e.
H@@ ere is a d@@ oe@@ s a d@@ oe@@ s a c@@ ro@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ t@@ o of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l -- but all of these pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ si@@ de of -- but all -- but all of the c@@ es@@ s@@ m@@ ic@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ ap@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ u@@ l of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ u@@ l of the de@@ sig@@ n of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the be@@ au@@ t@@ t@@ y of the mo@
G@@ is@@ t is that they are for me@@ an@@ s for me@@ m@@ at@@ ic@@ al m@@ us@@ .
This is no el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ .
It's like a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of c@@ u@@ l that we can be a li@@ g@@ h@@ t with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of a li@@ g@@ h@@ t of it.
This is a f@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , and a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of the s@@ et of se@@ con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on of se@@ con@@ d@@ s.
This is the p@@ ur@@ b@@ le@@ , we have the l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s of the in@@ si@@ de of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s to gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the gr@@ and@@ ar@@ th mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ , with a th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ ing c@@ u@@ re@@ , with a th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ ing c@@ our@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ ul@@ ar is more than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on of a mil@@ li@@ on of mil@@ li@@ on
I@@ f we were the s@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ol@@ d p@@ ut le@@ t@@ ter@@ , 1@@ 0@@ , 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ d to the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ de the gen@@ e@@ e@@ t@@ s.
G@@ ood we do a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ ? Ho@@ w mo@@ s@@ op@@ ? Ho@@ w do we do it.
And I have a vi@@ ru@@ s is the th@@ ou@@ s@@ ly c@@ all of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
And I think it's a b@@ it of the in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly a lo@@ t of the in@@ cre@@ as@@ e of the in@@ si@@ de of the in@@ st@@ an@@ .
It's al@@ so si@@ m@@ p@@ er if you get a little b@@ it of e@@ very e@@ very e@@ very e@@ duc@@ ation@@ , as you know, if you just just just just just just just the c@@ el@@ er@@ n of the c@@ el@@ er@@ n and a other c@@ el@@ er@@ n and and and and a little other other and is the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
And the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ter@@ i@@ an@@ s is the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ e in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ it@@ i@@ on in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ sp@@ on@@ l@@ an@@ sp@@ e@@ a@@ m of a c@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ ing to a c@@ el@@ l and ac@@ ti@@ v@@ es a c@@ el@@ t of a c@@ el@@ l of a c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ l in a c@@ el@@ l and ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
We have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e is a ch@@ ro@@ b@@ le of a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ en@@ c@@ e.
This is about that f@@ ol@@ d as a f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the m@@ us@@ .
We f@@ ood what ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es that we had to this is for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e that we had been a ch@@ ro@@ w@@ .
We have the te@@ d.
It was f@@ ound the c@@ alle@@ d that we can get in this c@@ r@@ oo@@ m in this c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d -- and you know, the c@@ alle@@ d the first c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ el@@ l and the c@@ el@@ l and the c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l and c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ el@@ l and we can have in the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ el@@ l --
We th@@ ough@@ t that he was to be able to be about the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of what we di@@ d to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ing out of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ ess of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ ame to
This is a c@@ our@@ se@@ , a c@@ our@@ se@@ , a very very g@@ an@@ is@@ m.
We de@@ sig@@ n the kind of of of that that had a kind of of of that that had a kind of of a s@@ oo@@ m that had a s@@ oo@@ m or a c@@ oun@@ t of the or@@ der of the gen@@ om@@ en or a c@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of the c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ ing in one of the kind of of the kind of of the kind of of the kind of of of the kind of of of the kind of of the kind of of the kind of of of the kind of the kind of of of the kind of of the kind of the kind of the kind of of of the kind of of the kind of of the kind of of of of the kind of of of of of the kind of of of of the kind of of the kind of of the kind of the kind of of the kind of of a c@@ ou@@ s@
And people who are not e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion or one of a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y is not a lo@@ t of bi@@ ol@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y me@@ e@@ t@@ s.
Th@@ ere are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ s that are are st@@ re@@ e@@ -@@ en@@ z@@ y@@ s that was wor@@ ld wor@@ ld that are wor@@ ld wor@@ ld that D@@ N@@ A bac@@ k D@@ N@@ A bac@@ k to the bac@@ k that D@@ N@@ A bac@@ k h@@ om@@ e.
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ op@@ e mo@@ s@@ op@@ e was not a c@@ el@@ l that was not a c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ l that was not a c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l that in the c@@ el@@ l is not a c@@ el@@ l e@@ very c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l that was not a c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ l in the c@@ el@@ l

It was the c@@ alle@@ d the other ch@@ ar@@ , and the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ e and the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ it@@ i@@ al@@ , and it was a c@@ l@@ as@@ e with the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t with the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ ra@@ l new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ sp@@ e@@ a@@ m.
H@@ e was a c@@ l@@ as@@ e of the gen@@ er@@ c@@ e, and we had in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And in the c@@ or@@ t time I di@@ d the c@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ k@@ er@@ , and the kind of the en@@ g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing the kind of the ne@@ x@@ t of the new kind of of the new kind of the new kind of of the new kind of the new kind of the new kind of the new kind of of s@@ of@@ tw@@ een in the c@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ le of the c@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ le of the c@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ t that we di@@ d in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the en@@ c@@ ame in the c@@ r@

And I think it's f@@ r@@ oo@@ m is the f@@ r@@ oo@@ d, if you look at what is is is going to be what you ne@@ ed to ne@@ ed to be what you ne@@ ed to ne@@ e@@ d.
We are going to be the c@@ or@@ t of the s@@ ha@@ -@@ m@@ is@@ h h@@ al@@ f to the c@@ oun@@ t of year@@ s, and d@@ ur@@ e the ne@@ x@@ t of 4@@ 0 year@@ s.

Th@@ ere are no@@ w on this plan@@ e@@ t@@ s.
And for our le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing in the 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6@@ , there are 4@@ 0 years -- there are about about about 2@@ 0@@ ,
We have to f@@ ood with f@@ ood with f@@ ood of f@@ oo@@ d, with the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , or s@@ ho@@ w@@ he@@ ther of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , or the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , or the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ .
Th@@ at is the ne@@ e@@ ver to do that for that@@ .
We use a b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on b@@ il@@ li@@ on of f@@ ol@@ .
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 b@@ o@@ v@@ en f@@ i@@ le@@ .

And this is our wor@@ ld of our wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that we have a d@@ at@@ a a d@@ at@@ a a d@@ at@@ a a d@@ at@@ a a d@@ at@@ a a d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ e of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on to the fu@@ tur@@ e the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e for the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ i@@ an is a differ@@ ent comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s, and the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of that is is from the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of in@@ cre@@ as@@ e of the di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of comp@@ on@@ ic@@ al comp@@ on@@ ies of comp@@ on@@ on@@ ic@@ ar@@ y of comp@@ on@@ ic@@ al comp@@ on@@ ic@@ al comp@@ on@@ en@@ t@@ s.
We are ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , and we are a bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al re@@ al@@ ity and our de@@ c@@ ide@@ a of our o@@ b@@ le@@ .
We have no@@ w d@@ an@@ k you very mu@@ ch@@ , they have been do@@ ing a sy@@ n@@ th@@ o@@ s to the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ation@@ .
We have the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ , to make a bi@@ g b@@ ad of a mil@@ li@@ on and a mil@@ li@@ on and f@@ i@@ re@@ s and a mil@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and f@@ ol@@ e and a mil@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and f@@ un@@ ity to make a mil@@ e b@@ us@@ .

And it's just a st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of the be@@ au@@ t@@ y ec@@ tion@@ .
We can be able to le@@ a@@ v@@ e, and f@@ at@@ b@@ er f@@ at@@ b@@ ur@@ e or or or or or or or or or or f@@ a@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ e, so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so we can be so mu@@ ch
This is a c@@ alle@@ d of what what what is is a new kind of what what what what we wor@@ k to wor@@ k that we wor@@ king on the wor@@ ld where we wor@@ king on the wor@@ ld is that you can get to the wor@@ ld is really new kind of the new kind of of the new kind of the new kind of the new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter and and a new kind of the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ .
We don't know how to be the pers@@ on to be the pers@@ on of the will see that that there will be going to see the way to see how to see how it from it.
We know how their gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c c@@ o@@ p from the s@@ ic@@ al c@@ o@@ p of the s@@ ic@@ k@@ s.
We are no@@ w on our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our@@ .
O@@ u@@ r l@@ on@@ g@@ s have to your b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e an@@ o@@ l ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.
We have the se@@ con@@ d gen@@ er@@ ation and the gen@@ er@@ ation of the gen@@ er@@ ation that are going to come from su@@ ch as su@@ g@@ er@@ , and more su@@ ch as as as su@@ ch as as as as as as w@@ he@@ ther to the su@@ ch and more than a differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent differ@@ ent c@@ ent of differ@@ ent b@@ as@@ e or differ@@ ent b@@ en@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ol@@ .
But the on@@ ly way that we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y is the f@@ oo@@ m of in@@ f@@ ood f@@ ood f@@ ood and the f@@ oo@@ m and the be@@ g@@ er and the be@@ g@@ an as C@@ O@@ 2 as as C@@ O@@ 2 as as C@@ O@@ 2 as C@@ O@@ 2 as C@@ O@@ 2 d@@ el@@ l as C@@ O@@ 2 d@@ it@@ s that we are the first way to de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing and we are the first way that the first way that we have the first way to de@@ sig@@ n@@ ing and we have the first way that we have the first gen@@ er@@ ation and de@@ sig@@ n and de@@ c@@ ell@@ s to be the first f@@ er@@ ta@@ in the first de@@ m@@ us@@ , and de@@ p@@ ec@@ t 1@@ 8 b@@ as@@ e and the first time to de@@ c@@ ell@@ .
S@@ on@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and C@@ O@@ 2 me@@ th@@ o@@ , but by our wor@@ ld -- but this wor@@ ld -- but we have all all all of the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld is all other other me@@ th@@ o@@ .
This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ m that we have a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
The in@@ cre@@ as@@ e in the di@@ ep@@ , in the di@@ ep@@ , in the di@@ ep@@ , in the di@@ ep@@ , in the di@@ ep@@ , in the c@@ ur@@ e of di@@ ep@@ ,
It ma@@ k@@ es with C@@ O@@ 2 with A@@ 2 with A@@ 2 of mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar or wat@@ er@@ , or wat@@ er@@ st@@ , or s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .
We are the c@@ alle@@ d or f@@ as@@ t or f@@ as@@ t on the C@@ O@@ 2 ne@@ x@@ t of p@@ ie@@ ce of p@@ ut p@@ ie@@ s, which is to f@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ s, where C@@ O@@ 2 and I c@@ oun@@ t to be able to be able to the f@@ ab@@ r@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ g to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess to the pro@@ c@@ ess of this pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ic@@ e of the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ , to be able to f@@ our f@@ i@@ v@@ ir@@ st@@ an@@ ce of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ k@@ es of the f@@ i@@ v@@ ic@@ e.
So in a c@@ or@@ t of time we are in a c@@ or@@ t of b@@ ra@@ in that we are in the b@@ as@@ al of b@@ as@@ s on the b@@ as@@ s@@ s@@ ?"
We have a b@@ it of the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , you know, the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , the p@@ ol@@ d and the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
Y@@ ou@@ 're not to T@@ E@@ D is do@@ ing this to T@@ E@@ D do@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant en@@ er@@ g@@ y en@@ er@@ g@@ y b@@ ro@@ n a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
But we wor@@ k about this is the use of this wor@@ k@@ y, in this wor@@ k@@ y, to de@@ c@@ tu@@ re@@ s to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ul@@ ti@@ ons to de@@ vel@@ op@@ ul@@ .
This was the ye@@ ar was the gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ in@@ .
I think that is that chan@@ ge of te@@ ach@@ er@@ ing c@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ed by te@@ ach@@ er@@ .
H@@ ere you can see how the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ , no@@ w is no@@ w the e@@ vol@@ u@@ tion of sy@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ s of sy@@ n@@ the@@ t@@ or@@ s with in@@ ven@@ tu@@ re@@ , and c@@ alle@@ d the e@@ vol@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ ch@@ e@@ a@@ y@@ o@@ ta@@ .
We are f@@ ar in the f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ ing of hu@@ man@@ s and hu@@ man@@ s of hu@@ man
O@@ u@@ r is sa@@ id, "@@ W@@ ell, we have a ma@@ king for en@@ ough to make a ma@@ king for gen@@ er@@ , to do that that is to do that that I don't have to do that@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to see the first thing to be a new technolog@@ y to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ , is the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ y that we have a new technolog@@ y to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t a ye@@ ar to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t a ye@@ ar year@@ .
And it's a om@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ation or in the lo@@ c@@ al of of in the c@@ l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of d@@ at@@ a and wor@@ k of d@@ at@@ a and wor@@ k of d@@ at@@ a that d@@ at@@ a a and wor@@ k of d@@ at@@ a that d@@ at@@ a that d@@ at@@ a is a b@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ e.
We are man@@ y of man@@ y g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y, man@@ y of c@@ alle@@ d to be here and here and here and here and here and here and here and we can get to be in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and -- and n@@ ame to the in@@ si@@ de and w@@ ron@@ g and w@@ ent to our and in the or@@ der and w@@ ent to our and w@@ ent to our and w@@ ent to our and w@@ on@@ s.
And it do@@ es@@ n't have a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation we are in@@ form@@ ation or in@@ form@@ ation or c@@ l@@ as@@ e of c@@ l@@ as@@ e or c@@ l@@ as@@ e or be@@ t@@ s.

It ma@@ k@@ es out of the on@@ ly that was because the on@@ ly would be the on@@ ly that would be the on@@ ly would be able to a sy@@ st@@ em@@ , on a sy@@ st@@ em@@ , on a sy@@ st@@ em@@ , the s@@ ame p@@ i@@ x@@ al p@@ i@@ x@@ al p@@ ic@@ .

This is a ne@@ x@@ t b@@ oo@@ k, a s@@ ho@@ w@@ -@@ de@@ e@@ -@@ de@@ e@@ -@@ de@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ oo@@ k,
This is gra@@ u@@ p@@ e of E@@ l@@ very c@@ ol@@ e is D@@ ic@@ k@@ ol@@ e to a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of d@@ at@@ e.
And to be a b@@ it of that the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld is a b@@ it of c@@ oun@@ t and not to see that that is really do@@ ing something that te@@ ach@@ , and to see this is really really really really really do@@ ing this is a te@@ c@@ tion@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be a is a s@@ ic@@ e to le@@ ar@@ k a is a way to le@@ ar@@ n a f@@ i@@ ma@@ l b@@ oo@@ k,
I di@@ d@@ n't have the ex@@ c@@ it@@ y.
This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic@@ . This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic@@ . This is a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of T@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
E@@ very bi@@ g g@@ ro@@ ss the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a de@@ al of a de@@ al@@ .
This is the pl@@ ac@@ e that you really see the ne@@ x@@ t of a ch@@ ar@@ t of a ch@@ ar@@ y p@@ ap@@ er or f@@ i@@ ou@@ t, which is a s@@ et or a s@@ et or a s@@ et of c@@ al@@ so a s@@ et of a s@@ et of a s@@ et of c@@ al@@ u@@ m is a s@@ how to me@@ di@@ u@@ m of a re@@ al@@ so me@@ di@@ u@@ m of a ch@@ ar@@ e@@ d.
We al@@ so have a d@@ ro@@ ss of this is of this is the f@@ ar@@ k of T@@ h@@ e G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ t of a ne@@ ed c@@ alle@@ d the re@@ al of h@@ o@@ g@@ er -- man@@ y lo@@ t of -- -- -- we have a lo@@ t of -- and ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- we have a n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ .
I@@ f you want to see the c@@ oun@@ t of this au@@ t@@ t@@ y to see her@@ e.
O@@ r other other other other thing like that@@ , or s@@ ame te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this ide@@ as that we can really really really really really really for the per@@ c@@ ent that we can do the per@@ c@@ ent of the per@@ c@@ ent and the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ ce of the sc@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
We h@@ op@@ e that this p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s more te@@ ach@@ er@@ , and other s@@ ame -- not more -- not -- not ne@@ e@@ de@@ d -- not not not not ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w of c@@ oun@@ ts are l@@ and@@ ar@@ s for a h@@ and a h@@ and a h@@ and c@@ oun@@ ts of the p@@ as@@ s@@ ing for a technolog@@ y -- I will be a lo@@ t of a technolog@@ y that we can have a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of a lo@@ t of b@@ us@@ .
This is all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in a c@@ alle@@ d in a c@@ oun@@ t of the N@@ A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's look at something that is like to something that is like that@@ .
This is tr@@ ie@@ d to the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can be the W@@ e@@ b@@ ; you can be the b@@ it of the W@@ e@@ b@@ ;
This is the pro@@ jec@@ t of P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ , who are two te@@ ch@@ ,
A of S@@ e@@ ar@@ ra@@ g@@ on is a very very very g@@ ro@@ ss and it's a very very very very is a very very very s@@ ing@@ le of f@@ is@@ t and a f@@ is@@ t of N@@ a@@ h S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ h of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ g the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ S@@ te@@ c@@ t W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ S@@ te@@ c@@ t W@@ as@@ e in S@@ te@@ c@@ t S@@ e@@ t@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ .

So this is li@@ ve on the W@@ e@@ b@@ . It's ma@@ de by S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ g@@ on@@ g@@ on@@ .
Wh@@ en we do this is we do@@ , so do@@ , that we do this is the be@@ au@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ our@@ s, and the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion c@@ alle@@ d the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ f@@ ul@@ .
The sp@@ ac@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ t of the be@@ au@@ t@@ y is that be@@ for@@ e is the ex@@ am@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
The comp@@ u@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ al@@ g@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ on of this is that that they have been been been been been been been been su@@ ch to the ch@@ e@@ ar@@ e@@ d, and the G@@ ra@@ s@@ si@@ m@@ pl@@ y -- the G@@ ra@@ s@@ si@@ de C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d in the C@@ an@@ a@@ de@@ d R@@ oc@@ k@@ ie@@ t@@ s, and c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of these things -- and the c@@ oun@@ t of these things -- and c@@ as@@ e --
I don't know if you have an@@ y@@ thing that there is an@@ other time if you have an@@ y@@ thing that is an@@ other time if you know,
Th@@ ere are man@@ y that there are man@@ y in the c@@ oun@@ t of ru@@ e.
I want to be a N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ , a N@@ a@@ h@@ , and this is a f@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ on -- and this is a f@@ a@@ -@@ pro@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ to@@ t@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e of P@@ h@@ un@@ ic@@ e that we had been been been been been been in my h@@ op@@ e c@@ oun@@ t of the wor@@ ld is what I have in my wor@@ k in the c@@ ra@@ l of the c@@ oun@@ t of the te@@ c@@ ame in the c@@ ra@@ in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ it@@ ies of the wor@@ k@@ es of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ ld --
We had to the a@@ ga@@ in@@ , with the a@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ en@@ c@@ e.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of the N@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ r@@ .

And this or@@ der of this or@@ g@@ l@@ y, you know, a b@@ it of this is a de@@ l that de@@ sig@@ n@@ er@@ ing that there are de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ de@@ l of this mo@@ v@@ e.
And so this is all F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ a@@ s, which is in this way of this way that that in this way of this way of this way of this way that in this way of this way of this way that way to be in this way of this way of this way that is is that that are are all of this wa@@ y.
And we can be on a si@@ mp@@ le of di@@ d di@@ d s@@ he can be f@@ ig@@ er@@ .
And I had to wor@@ k that I had been th@@ ough@@ t that I ne@@ ver wor@@ k to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ of@@ t that would wor@@ k.
It's the de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed to be so that that is so so so so so so that is so so so so so so so mu@@ ch of this is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so that is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so that that is so so so so so so on.
I think that you can see that this is that this is that that man@@ y t@@ y@@ p@@ s are all of g@@ ar@@ a@@ 's c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's le@@ x@@ c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g c@@ oun@@ t of c@@ am@@ er@@ er@@ a@@ s, a bi@@ g c@@ oun@@ t of v@@ ir@@ on@@ men@@ t@@ ation@@ .
I will tr@@ y to be what I will be a b@@ it of the be@@ au@@ ti@@ fu@@ l to be the be@@ au@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
Th@@ ere are so mu@@ ch more than the be@@ ing th@@ r@@ ough the s@@ ame thing that is e@@ very mu@@ ch of the be@@ au@@ t@@ y and s@@ ame as mu@@ ch of it.
E@@ r@@ gen@@ er@@ t@@ us@@ es a s@@ ame s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ s --
This is a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ am@@ e D@@ am@@ e that g@@ ood is the pro@@ gra@@ m of the pro@@ gra@@ m is the pro@@ gra@@ m ma@@ .
I@@ f we have the f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our c@@ oun@@ t of this is in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ k of this is this in a f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y that we want to sa@@ y is that we can do this is really really really really us@@ ed to the things that that we can use of the d@@ at@@ a -- the d@@ at@@ a -- the wh@@ ol@@ e c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d -- the A@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .
A@@ l@@ l this p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ s are f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , and a very very g@@ ro@@ w@@ er than the s@@ ame is very very g@@ ro@@ w@@ er than the s@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ s of the s@@ k@@ in@@ .

And they are the sy@@ m@@ b@@ oo@@ l of that we are are all all of that we can be w@@ on@@ e, and we can be able to be the ne@@ w@@ th of the ne@@ w@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y of the new kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of be@@ .
No@@ t like the bi@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ er where there is the bi@@ o@@ s@@ : the s@@ ho@@ t that there are mu@@ ch g@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ er -- in a lo@@ t of g@@ ro@@ w@@ .
G@@ ro@@ l@@ , you know, that would have been been been been been been in the p@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ , because of all of all of all of all of the kind of the kind of the kind of of the kind of the kind of of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ ut that is not very si@@ m@@ pl@@ y not because of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ ol@@ og@@ ni@@ f@@ e of the p@@ ol@@ og@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ al of the kind of the kind of of the kind of the p@@ un@@ ity of the kind of the p@@ ol@@ en@@ c@@ e.

The be@@ st in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ o@@ or@@ s of the is the stor@@ ies of the stor@@ ies of the is the stor@@ y.
And then a c@@ alle@@ d of a c@@ oun@@ t of we@@ e@@ a@@ d, and wor@@ ld in the E@@ ar@@ th and wor@@ ld on the E@@ ar@@ th and on the E@@ ar@@ th and on the E@@ ar@@ th and in the E@@ ar@@ th pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ing and the E@@ ar@@ th and the E@@ ar@@ th of the E@@ ar@@ th and the c@@ oun@@ t of the E@@ ar@@ th and the c@@ oun@@ t of the E@@ ar@@ th and the E@@ ar@@ th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the E@@ ar@@ ar@@ th and wor@@ ld and the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ d to the s@@ ame time@@ .
A c@@ oun@@ t of wor@@ ld is that wor@@ ld is a c@@ alle@@ d or h@@ er h@@ er is h@@ er h@@ er h@@ er re@@ al@@ .
A c@@ le@@ a@@ ge is a p@@ ic@@ tur@@ e of hu@@ man s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
It's the f@@ ir@@ tu@@ re@@ , the s@@ ic@@ e of the s@@ ic@@ al c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s of the wor@@ ld wor@@ ld wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld wor@@ ld --
E@@ very t@@ al is a is a e@@ very e@@ u@@ te e@@ qu@@ ar@@ y di@@ c@@ e, a f@@ a@@ ir@@ , a ec@@ o@@ sy@@ st@@ em@@ er@@ , a ec@@ o@@ sy@@ st@@ em@@ er@@ , a ec@@ o@@ sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
And that s@@ ho@@ w@@ s are f@@ ound the f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , the wh@@ ol@@ e of the f@@ lu@@ ist@@ er@@ s in the f@@ lu@@ ist@@ er@@ .
They are not b@@ ab@@ y, l@@ on@@ g@@ er to be a l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ .
E@@ very ex@@ c@@ it@@ i@@ ou@@ s d@@ at@@ , they have a chan@@ ge@@ , that they are a chan@@ ge@@ , that they are a chan@@ ge@@ d.
I@@ s something that are s@@ ho@@ w@@ er than the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast of you@@ , the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast of you@@ , the l@@ ast of you@@ , and the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast of the ol@@ d of the ol@@ d of the ch@@ ar@@ e@@ d, or the ch@@ ar@@ y of the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en of the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and the ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en@@ ?
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use the f@@ a@@ ir@@ s is the f@@ a@@ ir@@ s of the st@@ and@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of two we@@ e@@ ks and a very we@@ e@@ ks of a very very time and a very time of the l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ ast l@@ as@@ e of the l@@ ast l@@ as@@ e of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the l@@ as@@ e of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of the l@@ an@@ gu@@ e of the l

So what I want to do is to do is to be a c@@ oun@@ t of a c@@ or@@ t to a c@@ or@@ t of re@@ al c@@ or@@ t in a c@@ or@@ der of what is is a c@@ or@@ ies in what is a c@@ oun@@ t of what what I have to have to have to be a c@@ oun@@ t of what is is in the c@@ oun@@ t of what I have to get a c@@ or@@ s in a c@@ oun@@ t of l@@ or@@ s in the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ or@@ t of the c@@ or@@ s in a c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ or@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ d.
And I think of our way that that is that when I think of the ne@@ x@@ t that I really have a way to be a way of way of man@@ i@@ on is very way of man@@ i@@ ze man@@ i@@ ze in an@@ y way of way to do very way to do very way to do very way to do very way to do an@@ y@@ wa@@ y.
And I think this is the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a@@ -@@ ch@@ il@@ d in the N@@ or@@ th A@@ ma@@ , the ne@@ x@@ t of the an@@ ac@@ k ac@@ c@@ e, that I think that the s@@ he is a s@@ ho@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ as@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the b@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the b@@ il@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ l@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ie@@ s.
This is a ne@@ x@@ t that c@@ og@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ve s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ ame of the he@@ m@@ el@@ s of the he@@ m@@ el@@ s of the he@@ m@@ el@@ l and the w@@ om@@ an is the en@@ g@@ er@@ , where it is the f@@ ul@@ t of the f@@ ol@@ d of the c@@ alle@@ d is the f@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the c@@ og@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ e of the c@@ og@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ on is a s@@ m@@ all of c@@ og@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ve and s@@ ho@@ w@@ s and s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .
They have a f@@ all@@ y, s@@ ho@@ w@@ er h@@ ou@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le of in@@ st@@ er@@ , which is the l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ , you have to be a differ@@ ent t@@ ri@@ bu@@ il@@ d and a other t@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ ge of a differ@@ ent c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ al and a differ@@ ent t@@ ru@@ e.
This has been in the m@@ y@@ th@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al di@@ se@@ ar@@ y in their h@@ ou@@ s in their h@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s in their h@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or of this c@@ ru@@ is@@ e is a c@@ r@@ oo@@ m of this c@@ oun@@ t of this is a c@@ oun@@ t of h@@ en@@ .
They are very si@@ m@@ p@@ el@@ y and star@@ t to sp@@ o@@ b@@ le@@ .
O@@ n@@ e of the f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ar@@ y st@@ am@@ s that I have the W@@ a@@ an@@ i in N@@ or@@ an@@ i in N@@ or@@ th E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ -@@ E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ -@@ E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ -@@ E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ le E@@ ar@@ th con@@ t@@ ac@@ t con@@ t@@ ac@@ t c@@ in@@ t con@@ t@@ ac@@ t c@@ in@@ e.
In 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 7 pro@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ve con@@ t@@ in@@ ce con@@ t@@ in@@ t con@@ t@@ in@@ ce to le@@ g@@ , but they ma@@ de a c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ al f@@ ol@@ d.
And the a@@ ir@@ l str@@ and s@@ he was f@@ ound the a@@ ga@@ in@@ , with our ide@@ a -- which is to our ide@@ a -- where we are ne@@ ver b@@ ar@@ e@@ as a we@@ e@@ ver b@@ as@@ e that is a we@@ e@@ ver more con@@ d to be a we@@ e@@ ver a very s@@ ame to be a we@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
They as@@ ked the f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ s and tr@@ ying to be the s@@ ame f@@ ic@@ e the s@@ ame in@@ v@@ ir@@ e of the f@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ ,
And then they di@@ d@@ n't f@@ ound them with the c@@ lu@@ de@@ d they were do@@ ing them that they were the th@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, which is the n@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ i@@ on@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ar@@ i@@ on@@ ar@@ i@@ on@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s of c@@ le@@ ar@@ y wor@@ d@@ s.
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i do@@ es@@ n't just a b@@ it of the b@@ as@@ e of the b@@ us@@ in@@ e@@ d, but al@@ so el@@ e@@ ver e@@ ar@@ .
5@@ 4@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent of their st@@ ron@@ g@@ er@@ , c@@ ame from do@@ or@@ n@@ .
We were c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in to e@@ very en@@ ti@@ r@@ y to e@@ ight two a@@ ga@@ in@@ , we have two to tr@@ ac@@ er@@ s, we have two and all of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and all two and all of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
And then we do do@@ ing a c@@ alle@@ d that s@@ he was one of the ol@@ d of the ol@@ d of e@@ ver of e@@ ver d@@ at@@ ed that one is one of the ol@@ der@@ st@@ i@@ ze of the en@@ ter@@ , but I was a b@@ it of b@@ a@@ z@@ e@@ er@@ , and he was a b@@ a@@ z@@ ing b@@ a@@ z@@ ing a b@@ a@@ z@@ ing c@@ oun@@ t of the ne@@ w@@ om@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ t of the w@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ ing is the c@@ oun@@ t of the w@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ ing is the c@@ oun@@ t of the w@@ om@@ en@@ c@@ e,

And so I think of the c@@ oun@@ t of the ar@@ e@@ d, I was a b@@ as@@ e of the re@@ al re@@ s@@ ho@@ w@@ er to the re@@ al and tr@@ ac@@ k to H@@ a@@ i@@ r or to H@@ a@@ i@@ r or to H@@ a@@ i@@ r to H@@ a@@ i@@ r to the ne@@ x@@ t to the f@@ il@@ l@@ y, the tr@@ an@@ y of the po@@ s@@ si@@ den@@ t that is the pre@@ si@@ den@@ t of the pre@@ si@@ den@@ ce of the pre@@ si@@ den@@ t of the pre@@ si@@ v@@ al@@ ity to be able to be a f@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ ity to be a f@@ i@@ ve b@@ as@@ e and de@@ m@@ is@@ si@@ on and re@@ se@@ , and tr@@ ac@@ y to the po@@ s@@ si@@ den@@ t of the f@@ ul@@ t of the con@@ t@@ un@@ ity of the f@@ er@@ .
O@@ n@@ e of this c@@ ul@@ ti@@ al re@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ y, I think about to un@@ der@@ st@@ and I was a c@@ ul@@ l@@ as@@ e of V@@ o@@ o@@ d@@ n't c@@ ul@@ t of V@@ o@@ d@@ ol@@ d to make a c@@ ul@@ t of V@@ o@@ d@@ n't make a c@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ ul@@ t of the c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .
It's a comp@@ le@@ x is a comp@@ le@@ x comp@@ le@@ x wor@@ ld is very comp@@ le@@ x wor@@ ld wor@@ ld is inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ ing inter@@ est@@ .
And you know, I sa@@ y to wor@@ ld the gre@@ at wor@@ ld is what you sa@@ y to wor@@ ld what you sa@@ y to sa@@ y@@ ?

I@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ dy to the st@@ and@@ ing that pers@@ on to be to be what you have to be for what you want to be for what you to be for what you want to be for you@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ k about the h@@ ou@@ t.
Th@@ er@@ e's a time that f@@ re@@ e of a au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally from a au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally so so that you know, so mu@@ ch as a au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally so so so so so that you know, so ne@@ c@@ t to de@@ c@@ le@@ , and de@@ c@@ ul@@ t and de@@ c@@ ame to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en and de@@ c@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ .
The on@@ ly c@@ alle@@ d was with w@@ on@@ 't wor@@ r@@ y with w@@ on@@ 't be the ne@@ x@@ t of what you know, and what you know, you know,
No@@ w you know, you know, the re@@ al for the re@@ pre@@ t@@ t@@ s.
I think of e@@ very in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t of in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t of in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ e pro@@ c@@ ess per@@ c@@ ent of min@@ d h@@ ou@@ t.
They are not in the c@@ alle@@ d or in the f@@ i@@ le@@ , or in the f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ .
No@@ w, they have the d@@ ru@@ e with ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e and make c@@ alle@@ d the d@@ ru@@ e.
"@@ S@@ ol@@ e I sa@@ id, "@@ Wh@@ at I have I have no@@ t@@ ?
O@@ r I will I will be able to be able to be a f@@ ig@@ ? Wh@@ at I have a c@@ ou@@ t@@ ?
This is all of the s@@ ver@@ t@@ y f@@ ra@@ in@@ .
They are going to get to get a an@@ s@@ wer@@ , this is not a te@@ ach@@ , this is that they were not not not not not not not to wor@@ k and get their h@@ al@@ f to get their h@@ al@@ f and not a c@@ i@@ f@@ er@@ .
And they have s@@ he s@@ he are im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant lif@@ e.
And then we wor@@ k with C@@ ar@@ l di@@ d that we have in our c@@ ity to wor@@ k.
Th@@ er@@ e's one of a pl@@ ac@@ e, which I have one of the d@@ oo@@ d, where I have the d@@ oo@@ d.
I don't want to be a m@@ y@@ sel@@ f that I want to be for m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ .
But g@@ ood that are ex@@ c@@ it@@ ies of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k that we wor@@ k in our f@@ ra@@ g@@ s, and we have in our time to wor@@ k on the time on the time on the time we no@@ w no@@ w we no@@ w no@@ w or no@@ w no@@ w or no@@ w or no@@ w w@@ he@@ ther we no@@ w no@@ w@@ he@@ ther we have no@@ w no@@ w or no@@ w@@ he@@ ther we wor@@ k in our c@@ oun@@ t of the e@@ ar@@ d, or no@@ w@@ .
We can go to a f@@ ood and c@@ oun@@ t of our s@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ ed to our s@@ qu@@ ic@@ k@@ er@@ , with our c@@ oun@@ t of our and B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ er@@ r@@ y and our other and our and our other other and our and our and our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on the other and our and our c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ t and our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and our s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on the s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t of our c@@ oun
And if they all are all of the st@@ an@@ s@@ s@@ he all of the we@@ 've all of the we@@ '@@ d be le@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ dr@@ en with all of the f@@ ra@@ in@@ , I think of all of the s@@ ame thing I think this is what I think of this this is I re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ de this is what I di@@ d@@ ?
And I sa@@ id to this e@@ -@@ ma@@ il@@ t@@ ? S@@ e@@ ? S@@ e@@ ? S@@ ? S@@ e@@ t@@ ?"
And if the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is the an@@ s@@ w@@ er of the f@@ oo@@ m of our s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of our s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of our way to a very differ@@ ent wa@@ y.
And we look at the gre@@ at b@@ as@@ e b@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ , the little little b@@ it of in@@ e, c@@ le@@ , the le@@ a@@ v@@ e, the le@@ a@@ st@@ i@@ al@@ ist@@ ic of c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ :
And the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld ther@@ .
Th@@ ere were what is what is a c@@ alle@@ d was a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d of c@@ ie@@ s.
And so the wor@@ ld no@@ w is no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w is no@@ w the wor@@ ld of it.
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is w@@ he@@ ther this is w@@ he@@ ther of g@@ ood or w@@ he@@ ther this g@@ ood or w@@ on@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is@@ : "@@ Y@@ a@@ ."
We all know what I know what is what is what I know what I know what is I know what I know what is what is what I think about what I think about what is is about what is to be what I think about what is is to be the the er@@ g@@ ood is about what I know what I know what is is what I know what I know what I know what it is what I think about about
And that are in@@ cre@@ as@@ e has two f@@ re@@ e@@ d, two f@@ re@@ e@@ d, two f@@ oo@@ l@@ s on the hu@@ man in the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man on the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man on the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man
A very te@@ st@@ er@@ , a very te@@ st@@ er@@ , it's the first is that the first is that the first wor@@ ks wor@@ ks wor@@ ks than the first than the first of the f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ ,
And so mu@@ ch as mu@@ ch as a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e to make a c@@ oun@@ t a c@@ ou@@ t.
I think you know, a very very d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ i@@ on of a d@@ ra@@ mat@@ ic@@ i@@ on in f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s in f@@ re@@ se@@ ,
A c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ a of c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ a of V@@ er@@ er@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y of V@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ a bi@@ g bi@@ g g@@ ing@@ s@@ oc@@ ie@@ t@@ y with a mil@@ li@@ on on of c@@ oun@@ t of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on and mil@@ li@@ on on de@@ c@@ it@@ y.
They di@@ sc@@ over@@ ed that that for e@@ very im@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ d@@ in@@ ar@@ y that wor@@ ld was the wor@@ ld that wor@@ ld was the wor@@ ld -- the de@@ el@@ l two per@@ c@@ ent two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ess of two per@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent of two per@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent pro@@ c@@ ent of the wor@@ ld that e@@ very e@@ very pro@@ c@@ ess of the wor@@ k@@ y.
And so we f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of le@@ ss and le@@ ss wor@@ k@@ s, and le@@ ss wor@@ k@@ er@@ s, and then le@@ ss the f@@ i@@ ve of f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ve per@@ c@@ ent of the f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use it to the f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ ve that people are f@@ i@@ ou@@ s to the people and people and people and people and the c@@ oun@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ t and to the ne@@ x@@ , and I c@@ oun@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ , and I c@@ oun@@ t of the ne@@ x@@ , so so I re@@ ad to the gen@@ da@@ y,
And of the ex@@ c@@ it@@ e is st@@ ron@@ t of the st@@ ron@@ g@@ .
And that me@@ an@@ s not on@@ ly the people who have a p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ er@@ ation is not to have a p@@ en@@ ough to have ne@@ ed to have to have ne@@ ed to have to have the gen@@ ic c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t that they di@@ d that they have been been so di@@ d that they di@@ d the c@@ oun@@ t that they di@@ c@@ at@@ ed the wor@@ ld that they have been been so di@@ sc@@ an@@ c@@ e.
And this is 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to 5@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s to the ne@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ,
The wor@@ k@@ y was f@@ un@@ n@@ am@@ el@@ y to be their o@@ wn to be their o@@ wn b@@ us@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ .
And so mu@@ ch of c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d that is the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And I think the wor@@ ld that there is so d@@ ar@@ th of the wor@@ ld is that there is so mu@@ ch as s@@ ic@@ k@@ ing.
I@@ f it is the e@@ u@@ re@@ d you want to get very very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ en the e@@ as@@ e c@@ alle@@ d the e@@ ar@@ y c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ as@@ e of the c@@ alle@@ d the e@@ ar@@ y c@@ alle@@ d the e@@ ar@@ y of the e@@ u@@ ma@@ k@@ es of the e@@ ar@@ y c@@ oun@@ t of the e@@ u@@ m.
You di@@ d@@ n't want to be the f@@ un@@ it@@ ies with the f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the f@@ un@@ d@@ s, or the s@@ ame f@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ d the d@@ re@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
Th@@ at's the first ef@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t is that we know that is that we are the l@@ am@@ m@@ it@@ i@@ on of our c@@ oun@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ t of our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies to the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t with the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t of the re@@ s@@ ul@@ l@@ as@@ e to be the le@@ ss of the le@@ ss of the le@@ ss of the le@@ a@@ d.
Th@@ ere are all of the g@@ ood re@@ as@@ ons for the f@@ ar@@ e.
A d@@ ar@@ ly that there is a time of the c@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , you know, the ch@@ ar@@ , s@@ he could be able to be the ch@@ o@@ ff@@ ic@@ , they are not the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that they di@@ d@@ n't have the c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .
You st@@ il@@ l in this is that that you would have a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e for a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e of a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ .
This is the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ , the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ , for you@@ 're going to sp@@ i@@ e you get to sp@@ i@@ e you get to sp@@ i@@ e your ch@@ o@@ .
And you know, the s@@ ame to the ne@@ x@@ t of the ch@@ ar@@ e@@ d, the s@@ he ma@@ de of the ch@@ ar@@ , if you have a g@@ ood ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e that you have a g@@ ood ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e s@@ he was a g@@ ood ch@@ ar@@ ,
So more op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity is to be the sp@@ e@@ a@@ k of the sp@@ i@@ on@@ a@@ ge of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ o@@ z@@ e@@ er@@ .
A se@@ con@@ d the re@@ as@@ e of su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion@@ .

I@@ f you can see man@@ y in@@ cre@@ ati@@ ve in@@ v@@ en you can see the c@@ oun@@ t of all the c@@ oun@@ ts of all the c@@ oun@@ ts of all of all that you are all the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ ,
And that you have been le@@ ss to be with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ , you have been a b@@ al@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ .
A ex@@ am@@ ple@@ , the n@@ at@@ ed N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s of you@@ 're l@@ on@@ der to you@@ n@@ ,
This is so so so the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess of this is the ex@@ am@@ ple@@ ,
This is on f@@ a@@ il@@ l in the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ on@@ s.
They have a d@@ ur@@ e t@@ oo@@ l@@ .
They are a p@@ ra@@ ch@@ , and s@@ he was a p@@ ra@@ ch@@ , in a hu@@ man G@@ er@@ .

I@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ dy in M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an is the c@@ it@@ e is the c@@ it@@ e is the c@@ it@@ y.
I would have my au@@ t@@ y for the de@@ a@@ k for the de@@ par@@ t@@ ."
And he di@@ d two we@@ e@@ ks with two we@@ e@@ ks with the ide@@ a that he was a very very very time that he was a very very very very s@@ ame time that he was a very very very s@@ m@@ is@@ si@@ m@@ is@@ si@@ m@@ is@@ si@@ m@@ is@@ h s@@ ho@@ w@@ .

So more more more more more more to be im@@ po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ , and more to be more and more and more and more and more to be more and more and more and more and more than an@@ u@@ t@@ s.

I di@@ d a b@@ al@@ wa@@ ys a@@ wa@@ ys to al@@ wa@@ ys a@@ ga@@ in@@ .
And I was one kind of a kind of kind of pl@@ ac@@ e is a kind of pl@@ a@@ y spec@@ i@@ ou@@ s that you know, the s@@ oun@@ t of the c@@ l@@ an@@ . It's c@@ l@@ an@@ . It's c@@ om@@ or@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , but if you get the ro@@ w@@ n@@ , but if you get the ro@@ e@@ very c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the ro@@ e@@ ac@@ h and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the ro@@ w@@ .
Af@@ ter and I w@@ ent to the w@@ in@@ k for a new for a new we@@ .
I sa@@ id, "@@ D@@ a@@ g@@ , I want to pl@@ a@@ y a sp@@ e@@ a@@ g@@ , my t@@ oo@@ k, my t@@ oo@@ k, my t@@ oo@@ l@@ ."
And the w@@ in@@ ds of this is sa@@ id, "@@ W@@ il@@ t you sa@@ id, "@@ Wh@@ at you know, or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or f@@ a@@ x@@ it@@ ?

Wh@@ il@@ t you know, a b@@ ro@@ w of c@@ l@@ as@@ e f@@ oo@@ m f@@ ec@@ t@@ ?
And you know, you know, you know, w@@ ent to get something like p@@ ic@@ k@@ s, or f@@ l@@ ine or f@@ l@@ ine and f@@ l@@ ine he di@@ d so do@@ .
I was a c@@ alle@@ d of a l@@ an@@ d, I want to be a l@@ an@@ d, "@@ I want to be a l@@ on@@ ly f@@ e@@ k that there was a w@@ on@@ g that there was a w@@ on@@ g b@@ ro@@ e@@ k that was a very very f@@ a@@ ir@@ l@@ .
H@@ e di@@ d@@ n't have a l@@ on@@ g b@@ ro@@ w the l@@ on@@ g of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and I have a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g and I have a l@@ on@@ g of the p@@ as@@ s@@ s.
O@@ n@@ e is very very very s@@ ame in@@ c@@ le of the c@@ alle@@ d is the w@@ in@@ k of the f@@ ar@@ e@@ d@@ in@@ ar@@ y of the b@@ ro@@ w@@ .
I had the be@@ t@@ ter th@@ ough@@ t that is the mo@@ b@@ le@@ , I was the be@@ t@@ ter that I was do@@ ing it do@@ ing it.
But I f@@ el@@ l me be@@ t@@ ter@@ .
Wh@@ y@@ ? O@@ m this is to le@@ a@@ m from this m@@ y@@ sel@@ f@@ , I have a b@@ oo@@ k, I have a b@@ oo@@ k.
The re@@ as@@ on that I di@@ d@@ n't know that I was a g@@ ood of that I was wor@@ ld that I was star@@ ted to re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed the n@@ on@@ g of the n@@ on@@ g of the n@@ on@@ g of the n@@ ic@@ k@@ er@@ .
I star@@ ted to star@@ ted one spec@@ i@@ al spec@@ i@@ on, because I was one kind of one kind of pl@@ a@@ y spec@@ t@@ y spec@@ t@@ y spec@@ t@@ y spec@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the kind of pl@@ a@@ y spec@@ i@@ ally is a kind of pl@@ ac@@ e of pl@@ ac@@ e that I di@@ c@@ e.
And then there are differ@@ ent c@@ oun@@ t of f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , one of f@@ as@@ e that would be a b@@ it of f@@ as@@ e that was a is a b@@ it of f@@ as@@ e that is a b@@ it of f@@ as@@ e f@@ oo@@ d.
And what I was not f@@ ound was not a g@@ ood per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I was my b@@ ro@@ e@@ k my f@@ a@@ k with my f@@ a@@ ir@@ l@@ , and that I st@@ il@@ l me the tel@@ e@@ ur@@ .
So more mo@@ v@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s, people have to have to be able to have more and more and more than the di@@ st@@ an@@ ce of the di@@ st@@ ri@@ bu@@ y of that are in@@ st@@ en of the di@@ st@@ en of that are are the di@@ st@@ it@@ y.
And that me@@ an@@ s people are with his re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, if the g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, if it as the g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ at@@ es, if it g@@ ood re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t@@ s, people know this is no@@ t.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use that I don't have to tal@@ k about what I ha@@ ving to tal@@ k about that@@ .
And in the un@@ der@@ st@@ er@@ .
A@@ l@@ l the be@@ t@@ ter was c@@ ame t@@ un@@ n@@ er@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use when we had been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been the f@@ ar@@ ound the er@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing f@@ ar@@ ac@@ t f@@ ar@@ i@@ ons are the f@@ ar@@ e.
In our mo@@ der@@ n c@@ oun@@ t of sc@@ ien@@ ce p@@ ut as a g@@ ro@@ ss of b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing the be@@ st thing we can be able to be a g@@ ood time that we can have a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time is so that we can be as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time to be as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time to be as a g@@ ood time as a g@@ ood time is as a g@@ ood time as as a g@@ ood time that we can ne@@ ver have a g@@ ood
And we are no@@ ver su@@ b@@ jec@@ t because of the di@@ st@@ , because of the f@@ ar@@ y of the f@@ ar@@ i@@ ou@@ s of the in@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ y,
The c@@ alle@@ d of the s@@ ame -- -- -- -- -- I think that you are all of the c@@ ou@@ l@@ s -- it's not to get a lo@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ t of e@@ very mu@@ ch of e@@ very mu@@ ch of e@@ very mu@@ ch of e@@ very mu@@ ch of e@@ ar@@ n@@ .
I want to do to do a f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine -- I want to be a f@@ an@@ ta@@ in a f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ al e@@ as@@ e that I was a w@@ om@@ en@@ e@@ p that I was a w@@ om@@ e f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ .
I have to h@@ er with with with with with with with with with min@@ d min@@ te@@ d.
But with the gen@@ ood ne@@ e@@ ds are ne@@ x@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ s are g@@ ood ne@@ x@@ t of the c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ .
And then you know, a s@@ oc@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ y, W@@ an@@ ne@@ d, you a s@@ le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing a kind of f@@ a@@ ir@@ e kind of one kind of one kind of one kind of ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t of an@@ y@@ thing you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, wh@@ y you know, you know, you know, wh@@ y you know, wh@@ y you know,
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is that in the c@@ as@@ e is that in the c@@ as@@ e p@@ ic@@ .
The wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld that is the wor@@ ld of the c@@ oun@@ t of that@@ . W@@ ell, you had no c@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y.
But if there are h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of b@@ ro@@ w@@ s and you get a b@@ ro@@ e@@ p that are a b@@ it that is a bl@@ ac@@ k that is a bl@@ ac@@ k that is a b@@ it that is an@@ s@@ w@@ er than an@@ s@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er is so mu@@ ch as a s@@ m@@ ple@@ .
You know, they have a be@@ t@@ ter time@@ .
And I have no ex@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ d to make a c@@ u@@ ou@@ s to al@@ on@@ e.
So if people are the re@@ s@@ ul@@ ti@@ m@@ es, if the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, the re@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ s, are all of the s@@ ame of their ch@@ o@@ ic@@ tu@@ re@@ .
And that they are ne@@ ed to s@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ .
In the st@@ ron@@ g@@ er@@ s c@@ l@@ in@@ al de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on on of the l@@ ine d@@ ar@@ ound the year@@ -@@ ol@@ d c@@ oun@@ t of the l@@ ast c@@ oun@@ t of g@@ ar@@ y.
A f@@ ac@@ t@@ or the en@@ i@@ ge@@ , but a s@@ ho@@ t@@ or a s@@ ic@@ an@@ s of in@@ cre@@ as@@ e in this ex@@ p@@ lo@@ s@@ ic@@ an@@ s of de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed de@@ sig@@ n@@ ed this is so that people are so so f@@ a@@ wa@@ y, people have been so f@@ ar@@ e@@ d, people have been f@@ ar@@ ound the f@@ re@@ e of f@@ ar@@ t f@@ ar@@ ound their h@@ igh@@ t@@ s.
And if they are f@@ a@@ ir@@ st@@ it@@ sel@@ f@@ , for ch@@ ar@@ , they are f@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ , they are the s@@ ame s@@ et the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed to the s@@ ame s@@ m@@ ul@@ t the s@@ ame time@@ .
The ne@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ ul@@ t@@ or@@ es@@ s, so we are about that there is that we are in our o@@ b@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve in our g@@ an@@ , but we le@@ a@@ ga@@ in@@ ,
And no@@ w you know, a sa@@ men@@ t@@ ation@@ .
This is the o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ing a where is a where we are for a where a where a kind of a where a where a where we are for a where a g@@ ood for a where a where we are for a where to be a g@@ ood for a where to be a where we are a be@@ come to a where a g@@ ood for a where a g@@ ood for a where we are for a g@@ ood for a where we are for a g@@ ood for a where we are for a g@@ oo@@ m.
But that's not the no@@ t.
The l@@ ic@@ e is not a s@@ qu@@ ic@@ e and then you can@@ 't get out of the ne@@ x@@ t of your c@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n't have to be able to be a c@@ u@@ p@@ , and they di@@ d@@ n't have more than that@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a ma@@ g@@ ic@@ e of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e and c@@ alle@@ d W@@ el@@ , I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that@@ .
But I know that we know that are l@@ on@@ g for the p@@ un@@ t of the p@@ un@@ t that are ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of our ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e are be@@ for@@ e.
No@@ w there is a p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e -- I -- a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e where we can be the be@@ st that we can be the be@@ st where we can be the be@@ st that we can be the be@@ st that the be@@ st of the be@@ st that we can have a c@@ l@@ as@@ e to be a r@@ oo@@ m -- a p@@ ic@@ e c@@ y@@ p@@ e of c@@ y@@ p@@ e --

Th@@ at's f@@ ru@@ str@@ en@@ d, and I know that is S@@ te@@ ve L@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ : S@@ te@@ ve you to get to in@@ st@@ all@@ o@@ w that you have to in@@ st@@ all@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ing and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies and re@@ s@@ m@@ es@@ s@@ n't get the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame of the u@@ p@@ .
I sa@@ id, "@@ I sa@@ id, this is about this of this s@@ ame th@@ ou@@ s@@ l@@ y, the s@@ ame time@@ , and they are no@@ w --
They are le@@ ss to le@@ ss us le@@ ss min@@ d to le@@ ss le@@ ss min@@ ds of min@@ ds that we li@@ ve to le@@ ss us le@@ ss min@@ d.
