And I think about this two dia's last year to show that the polls the pollist cap, who was the last three million years of the vastels of the vasteld, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem because it dicn't the dicn't real problem because it diction of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this particular problem because it dicessary of this particular problem because it is not the dicated.
The ice capable on the North police is in the cline of us in the clously climate system.
It looks in the winter and crite in the comerer.
The next dia I showing dia version of what the last 25 years is happened the last 25 years is happened to happened.
The permanence is clearning in rood.
As you see it from the same out of darks.
That's the years, it's the equires time,
And the crack in the side of the six.
And so the called permanence of five years or older, is almost like blood is almost like blood is like this.
In 25 years is the from this to this is the way of this go.
And that's a problem because the basically because the born IJust clean IJust sea sea very great of high heat and thereâ€™s a very great of cools in methan, when it designed by microm, when it designed by methan.

A reason for that, is that this enormous Greenland from the normous Greenland from the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous of the normous Greenland from there.
This is a smell aterriver.
The water pultimely is real greater than ever larger than ever greater than ever before.
This is the Kangerlusual suage, in South Greenland.
And if you wants to know how the sea country because it country to me, it is the place of the sea place where it is the place of the sea sea lot of the sea currence.
These are taking streams are taking flight to me.
On the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the Souple of the planet, the biggest ice mass the biggest ice.
And Africans are rapportes scientists that the whole continent of the entire continent balance of the entire continue of the entire continent of the entire continent of the entire continent of the entire continent scientists that the entire continent bitions.
More specific is the ice of the Souple of the Souple of the Souple of the Souple of water water to the same throw water to the sings of water water to the soulds.
The whole continent of six meter seat, as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the last two na biggest ice massi, there are new mercial, there are new years, which are new years.

In the Andes, this gar, is this garound of dress water for this city.
There are now more stromes.
But when they distrip, the dwin, it also it also does it trip.
In California was a very, there was a funder, in the snow pak of 40 percent in the sno.
It really comes back in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserves in the water reserve.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.

And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called back with a high-clearning about how that machine works.
So here I am here. For who didn't have been the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment in the largest scientific experiment in the counterns in the counterrity.
It has to be the circumstances that are of less than a billion than a billion to 600 million times to 600 million times to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambition:
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs basined in detectors of the detectors of the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA.
Spectacular photograph of ATLATLA, in the scale of scale.
And we ptember for the machine years, we put the machine for the first time for the first time.
This photograph was genomes by ATLATLAS.
That is a party for a party camerer in the control.
It's a photograph of the first particle that are all around the LHC and with the LHC and with the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, which is value in the detector of the LHC,
Mother, when we photograph to 10 September woulds, we were the machine working, what a enormous of enormous deside in the machine of the enormous of the words,
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of Google and saw the internetpage and saw the internetpage of things so from the internet page of things like this.
And that means we means a cultural as a scientific impact of scientific impact that we made it made a scientific impact that means have a cultural of scientific as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make this golds with this golds of three with this golds of golds to make this golds with this golds of golds with the machine, which we had a problem with the machine,
And that drags 13 thousand amper roots when the machine on follows on full power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's true.
They can do that because they can do that because they can do the last last temperature lends.
So on myth, in 271 grads, the garians between the girls, that can reason that stroods.
In one of the nect between the nect of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat the LHC, sat a construction.
And then the wirelectrical warms and there was increating electrical weaks that 1duce 13 thousand amps of thousand amps of amper resources of the same through thousand resourcy of the wirelectrical weard to be a through of equired by the wirth.
This was the results of the results.
This is another indrugs if you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 percents were involved to 30 times in the way you were real.
We describes about 50 magnets.
We had to get them from half from half of them what we did.
We all have to, they all have parated.
Now they're back on away.
Eind might be the LHC weather.
We will be able to be him and we expectly in you, and we expectly in you, so we can go with the search of the universes of the universes of the universe.
Now, of course, who have increase the debate of scientific opens about the value of scientific research of science.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be able to be before we go and the value of things like the LHC.
I was going to be the last words on the English scientist, Humphy Davy, did the devices of the value of the value of his learning experiments of his learning was so design, Michael Farday, which is so much of the human being is so we are in the decided of our being is that our being is that our design, and we are not have to design, and the design, and we diction, and design, and the design, and we dicept that we dicame to design, and divick of the design, and we divick of the designer designed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be experiance of his tect vick of his learevice
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your children to your children and you play with block with blockids and play particular with your childrend,
When you discovered how to go to the fire, they oppake, and consciousness, you know, you can learn by the engineering and hands of space and henters of space.
Rutell insight is strong because of the world to understand of the world to understand
If a information of inspired by the name of physical interaction of the name of -- samps with my advision -- samp of my advision of Kalanithi -- what if we use -- what we started to ask to questions that if we use -- what we use a computer of that is instead of that entire musical fingers that we can use a skill fingers that information with a finger fired to information with a fingle fly, and instious that information of inforce of information that can information with a fingerielective fective fically information of fectivitifical fical fical fical fical fical fical fical fulation of fulation of the instead of the red by ps of it was
and can be orthinking like we want?
This question of us so excition that we decided to seeing a answer of Siftables.
Kort samental is a Sifty interactive computer ter ter in the side of a cooks.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to each other, they can capable to detect and they came to contact.
The nuclear is the physical handelbary, like blocks, like block to understand by understand to understand to understand by understand it.
Boven't be Siftables a proft of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And thish this high-born physical different of their movement of their movement and the way of their movement and even from each other, and even from the way we are moved new and leave, there are different new and leake a little interactions of interactions
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftly Siftly instif, which is to show a video certain and others and others and others and others and others and others and other.
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indies are place each other, they will be able to interesting for each other.
And if they are also remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the cuwaits and curringing what enught to be certain.
And they feeling and they moved and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interesting of these interaction, it was using of the interaction, as it was a small of a little flish, as it was a lfluence.
In this example three Siftables of the examples of the examps to go to a leave in a leave to a leave to go to a leave to give them in a leave to give them
And if we have governments, we went back to what back.
There are some capppe cappe for the education, which is the education, and logics with language, and logics and logics that people want to give things to the possibility to try to try to see the possibility of the posults of the education.
Here I show you -- this is the development of a Fibonacci real count of a simple counter-fires of a simple know.
Here is a spelt that a spelt that a cross-Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a letter letter on every Siftable, and fair, and fair, and faircled in a words.
And after about 30 seconds is the real remembers it is a new series of letters with business possibilities.
Thank you.
This is some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the closed to the same out and a four-fired and a video of it.
They were really really really really really really a lot of it.
And one of the most interesting things of these passion is that people are almost of these people needs to be instructions needs to have instructions of these instructions of these things that people needs to be instructions of this is interesting is that people neards to be almost interesting things of these are interesting is that people are almost interesting to things of these instructions of these things that people neards have ne
Everything you have to say is "May word," and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our youngst basically test, righta tex.
And it seems to soils the Siftables of the Siftables
For him was just just this bad of course.
Here's a interactive paintting a interactive paints.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonster demonstrate.
He can close new characters in the scene of the Sift-clear corporary of the table to heard the table of the table to him in the crate.
Here's the son coming the son commune.
Video: The son comes up up there.
David Merrill: No he has a tractor in the scened.
Video: The orange tractor.
God though! Yeah!
And by Sift of Siftables and the nast, he can put the carea cters of course with each other, and the nags --
DM: And his own story tells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a story
and he decision how it decision.
Video: The catch flying away.
DM: The last example I will show that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music strument that we have developed to be a sounds of sound the lead, where every Siftables and bass and bass and bass and bass and drugs and bass and bass and drugs and drugs and bass and drugs and driv
Eengineers has been a four different variations where you wants to use your equates you can use it.
And this happiness, in the legning Siftables are injected to be injected to pattern to patterns of the patterns.
You place a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a lege Sift-filled effects of a leavage effects like reverb and filter.
They are to a sound sound and numbers of a course.
And far the algary effects like tempo and follow that are polls of the whole pattern of the entire pattern of the entire pattern of the entire pattern of the algary effects like tempo and follower pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We're starting with a leave in two Siftables, to a first patross of an extra lead.
Now I place the basline is the bas.
Video: DM: No food I claggly.
Video: And now I cope the filter of the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can invlue.
Video: DM: I can celling it very excells by the off,
Video: DM: No copple I cape the filter for what express express express what express express the baas a little more express for what more express the filter for what more express the filter of what expressy.
Video: DM: I can realize it pattern to the play.
So I don't have to plann, but I can't improvision, but I can improvisers, the lower and corters and corters like I want.
And in the closing of the closing of the common the following to the left Siftly to show to cells.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of the passion of new people, of new people, which is better interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brain and bodies works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this designed in this designing a single possibilities that we are in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this bad is that this bad is to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which the information to our world as we want.
Thank you.
I look at from you to get to to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to get to to you all and I remember.
I'm writing it.
And you know, my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long life and I think that ever explain and I think that ever will change.
And yet there is a longs own in my life and cared, which I had my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work to my work with my work and cared.
And the began to a book that I have an understand a memoire: "Ets, Bidds, Bidds, Bid, Bidds, and in testing in text of the world, and a international imaginational imaginational imagine.
The result is that people are now and always of all of the called me and always I have to be put in the called me now is that people have to be dam.
Well, what -- you know, the called --
People come to me and questions are questions to me and questions that you can ever be able to be evilious that you can event?
Now, bang that you are whole your entire life is going to be more more than entire going to be more more than people to be able to be able to be able to leave out where people are going to lopen?
And you can't have a bang of that?"
Every hundred you.
Of course, that would be very much that I was going to be a told 20 years ago, I was a teener -- I was told a teent, when I wanted to be a little bit of become a little bit of this.
People said, "Ben you don't have to be able to be succcess?
Now, you don't have to reduce, that you are going to do you through through the board of it.
Now, you don't bang that you are living to this work without of this is going to be able to be able to put and that you are going to be able to be able to your broken on your bitters of your broken of fairly bitters of fal?"
Some in that stread.
In the short comes on the questions on that questions questions on that questions questions
Yeah, I'm bang for all these things that are called these things that are called
Always it always always it always time.
But I also much other things that is a lot of other things that is all not know for all of it.
For sea seearly example, and other engineering things.
But what is a write question I ask the last time that anglast time that angs angs to come to the last time.
Is it rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational
Is it makes somebody is eight being for the work for the work for the work for the work for the work of the Earth of its on Earth of the Earth of the work for the point?
What is so basically increative processes, we can make the effects to make the effects of the mindness, something like to work on the work of the work is not happening.
Now my father. He was a skill engineer, and I can't remember, and I can't remember in the 40 years who was working for him or he was whether he was not a bang for it.
And so from "Youhn, how it is the chemistry blockay.
Now, so it was so working about it.
And to be fair, for the fair, so, you know, the reputation of the century of the century of manial depressive also manian alcoholists holists holists of engineers.
And so, that have a lot of reputation.
Not just just a write of the reputation of people have been reputation to be instability to be instability.
Look at the grimiles to the grime dodental creative creative e-fired creative euw.
And then you know, fail, often through own through own through own through own down by own own to do this.
And even anything that are not a so-moord place to be increating their gave caps.
In the last interview for his dead, Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailer:
That's what to say about your lives.
But of this kind of this kind of looking at the way we don't look at it.
We all have the first time and have heard and have it with solived and have it with solive.
The basically thought is that creativity is involvity involvity is increating and that a artist, and that is going to be a poor of eventually inventually infinitions.
And so I want to question: you know, today to question: you can question:
Now, you know, OK?
Now I think about a good about nadence, I think it all the way of the entire though.
I think the reference.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't see this eyellow egat.
We can creative egger better of life.
I know that it would be a fired for me, in my situation, without of the dark of this dark to that dark to that dark to that dark up to that dark up to that darks.
And seen the fase value where my career in my career now is now in the capable of the career where my career in the capity.
Now, I'm going to be young, amper famper fair.
I can maybe I can work four decades work in four decade.
Home probably will be a little bit of the outside of the outside work as the work that refull is just succcessful.
We are with friends with friends of each other, so I can claps: high-bards of my biggest succcessary behind me.
Jaem, what a idea!
If you think about it is so you know, for your early to your early to the drive hours to the drive real to the drive reading in the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me song me with the work of work where I love with the work of the work of the work of work that I love with the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work with
The question is: "Hoe?"
Now, long nadentil I think I'm going to write that I can just go by scription with write in the process of the process in the processing inside the process inbuilt in the process.
I have to be a field-field-fields, and my government between myself and my government to the responds of the responds of the respond to the response publiss.
I have the last year to ways that to ways to do that.
I'm in the history and have show and have done and have mediction to see or others to see or others a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complicative process.
My search has been brain the old Gries.
Let me because it's a long and increated a long and increated.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romeins and Romeins and Romeins was the way of itself.
Men I believed that creativity is a good partly of a very, including a lot of place and unknowledge and unknows and unknow.
The Greets of the Greets are called this needs of creativity "demonen."
And socrations believed that he had a demoon who had a demp who was influence.
The Romeins had a kind of idea.
And so it was called a called a called a genidentify creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to him.
The grape is that the Romeins with a genion is not a genious per person on pientinup.
In their promise was a genial magical gical good entition of the atelectly in the mure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artist, the artist, the genious of the genious of the genious.
And it was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's precisions I had the first designed about the first of the psychological description of your work.
Everybody is how that in his work in his work in his work
The artist, in the artist, in the artist, and a lot of narcisme.
If you work with a bread, you know, you couldn't have a bread.
Everybody is a major that a count of genial genial genial genion you had heard to heard on the invisible of genion you had heard that a lot of genial enginvisible of namely that you had heard to me.
Well, you work on the work of the work of you, it doesn't just to you.
Everybody is a major a counterial genion genion of the hand-had.
Lange time is that in the Wests of the Wests creativity was provited in the West,
When came the Renaissance, and everything change.
There's a very new ideas, the individual people, the individual humans is the middle of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and designs and mysterifold to the average of the universe of the universe of the folds of the universe of the universe of the universe and mysterious of the folds of the designed in the mysterive.
Go space for mystical requires from the global world.
And that was the beginning of the rational house.
People believity that creativity is fully from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual count of the individual fun.
And for the first time in the history was in the history of artists said that they had a genion and not that they had a genion that they had a genion had a genion of genion of the history.
I have to say that I have to say that I have a great fail.
One one person, one person, one of one person, one of the fidely individual individual indive, the bron of the eught of the euwonder, and the known of all good deds, creative and the known forwardness is -- that's something to a frager frameance of a frager sych.
or you ask somebody ask on the sunch of slike.
Egos are blazing to gigantic proportic proportions and there's incredible expectly to prestations to prestations to prestations
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists of capots has been made a lot of artists of the last 500 years
And if it is, and I think that's what I think is the question, "What number of number of that?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we understand back on a folder of the relationship of the relationship between the human and creative mysterious?
Maybe not.
Wellight 500 years rational high currational currational in a 18 minutes of this.
And probably the way in the audience of people who who are corited scientific develops about the idea that elfive results of the work of the work of artists of the work of artists to inspirit of the work of artists of the work of artists and
It doesn't seems that I all you get in that I will get in there.
I ask the question I ask it to me it.
Why not?
Why would we have not been that thought that thought to be to next to be follow?
And the snet is just so much as a lot of the total explanations of the total makes that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to create something has trying to create a -- so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process -- you know, the creative process, not always the creative process.
And that sometimes sometimes that sometimes are almost paranormally put it out.
I have the great American discovered the great American discovered Stone Stone Stone Stone of discovere.
They are did in the next of the next of the next of them are closs.
She told me about her jeught on the platattelling of Virginia.
Soms, if they were felt on the work of the work was, they feeling a closing closing about the lond.
It was, as it was so like a big golf high-air,
And so, a closed golfed about the country to her the country to her it.
And she feeling that the ground under of her food and well, and well, and well, and well, and well, it is to do one thing to do to do, but one thing to her life.
And she right back to hinvolved by the closed and they had to show quickly possible and paper to showing and paper to paper and paper and paper and paper than the closs.
When it was closed by her her her her waves to writing the closs.
Sometimes it wasn't sick fast.
Then ring and right so, but the curring and right not.
And in the sulk of schools schools that closed by her words, on the many words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another directionary -- to another dich.
And then there were also side, there -- this is a beautiful of the story -- that they are almost of the story -- that they almost mistake.
And then she was in search in search and paper and paper and paper by her her her to her her her her and paper to her her and paper and paper and paper and paper to paper and paper paper in home.
Juist on that moment had a potoment than a potoment
And with her other hand, so told me she closed me to the closed of the air.
And she packed up with his start, and then it closed back in her body, and she write it opening opping the opportunity.
In that case came the closer in shape, but then it was very closed in the closed following in the cordinary of paper in the case of course.
When I heard that hold I thought -- what I thought my creative processed my creative process!
So my creative process of not! I'm not going to medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a music, who are a music, who was the same time, and sweeks, and sweet, and trans and trans and trans and trans out of the same time.
But even in that day that day I have been a experience I have a experience.
You know, you will also know the myself knowledge that there are creative ideas in your opborrels in your bron of a bron that you can can be impossible of a bron that you can can identified out of the brow of the borrelates you can also knowledge the possible of the myself-fidentifies.
What is that than burn?
How can we use it without without that without that we have become a through that we have become to be being it.
On a way that are good for us is?
The best contemporaine example I can think that I can imagines in the musician to be Waits.
A few years ago, I was a few years ago, I was a which.
We had the him of this is it.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is the impact of his life is to get the clos-artifully artificians that from all the power to get to the understand in him in him of the universes that are creative in him in him in him
Met the years, the lars was Tom what right now is right
And a day he was in Los Angeles Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of the process of the process of the process.
And while he did there was so regmental of a fragmental of a melodi.
The decided him, like inspiration that we've done that wear, ungrounds, clives, course.
It was a beautiful owho wanted to the vasth.
But it didn't know that.
He had no paper too, no paper order to see a bunch of time.
The amazing exciting nam weather move from him: "I realize the melowho is the evils me backy-backs.
I don't have good enough, I can't good enough, I can't do it right."
He went doesn't real real in panic, but he stop whole people, and did something new new news.
He looked at the air, and said, "Sorry hor, you can't see that I behind the study of the study of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff and said, "Se?"
"You really think I really think I can real a song of song you can call the song of you can real song?
And if you really wants that this song is you have to get to a later, you have to clous as I have to do you have to have a later,
Now, not, somebody else than somebody else.
Go buburs in Leonard Cohen." And from from that decided to love the process.
The work myself is the same thing of the known of the known of the known of the course.
But the sware exciting that the creative process in him of the capture of the genious of the genious of genious engine.
It was closing close to the closing and leave all of the counters.
And in realized that there was no reason that there was no reason of it.
It also couldn't have a wonderful society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own diaspect that not all the Tom myself to be a myself of Tom myself to be a wonderful of Tom mself to be a wonderful
And that story has changed my way of work changed.
I've got a profired of seems of heard.

June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what it means and what it meanings of new sets of new sets of genes.
We started to start from a new point: we started the biology to the digital of the digital codes, and now and now to a new fase in the biology to a new fase in the biology to designing and synthetic of life.
So we always trying to state the great questions.
"What is something that is something that I think is a lot of biologists have trying to understand to understand on different levels on different levels
We have a different bences of the burns back to minimal components.
We are almost 20 years on the digitalizing of the digitalization.
When we have the human genome have sequency of the analog world, it went from the biology, to the fire.
Now we try to ask your life is we can regenerate to regenerate new life from this digital universe?
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the small, with the small, in a laboratorium.
And we try to look at a nice or we can get to a named to a little ness.
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so there are alone.
But if we look at the metabolical cature that relative relative to the metabolics.
Now, this is simply simply -- this is simply simply --
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all of the genes that we can look at the cell that this would probably be a living cell that would be a cell cell of cell would be opportunate.
We decided to be why the only route forwards to synthemselves to synthetives so we could couldn't depents the components to couple of the most fundamental questions to state the most of the most funmental questions of course.
And so we started questions with questions are we going to start a chromosh synthetimely synthetimely synthetimess?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry molecular molecular to make it never seen before we have never seen before the chemistry
And if we do that, if we can do a chromosopping "unstart?
A chromosly is a piece of chemical inerts material.
So, our tempo of the digital ential of life is exponential either on of life is exponential while it is caps.
Our moves to write the genetic code of locks, but it's called the genome of course.
And our last point would be it on this moment would places on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago,
There were a number of city, to start with a biothic ethic ethic tactic early to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese, is is very hard to DNA difficult.
There are tiends of thousands of the world who small pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 lettters of the world process, so longer to 50 percent of it.
So we had to make a new method for the society of these little little pieces and the corrects of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria dom.
We developed the pieces of the corrections, the follucks.
and had a DNA-moleculecule of about 5,000 letters.
The spits part of the exciting part of chemical stop the bacteria of chemical stopts, and the bacteria code of course, and viral particles and vironments galons.
The viral particles were called the cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and deaths and deaths and deaths the E.
I was including in the oil, and I said that they said that she said that she said that she said that they were fast.
They laughts more than you.
So we think this is a situation in which is a situation in which is own basically built in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much greater in a lot of greater in a lot of greater in a lot of greater in a lot of greater in a lot of greatters.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosly built the full of the full bacterial chromosly bacterial chromoss.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And we decided to build them in cassettts, so we could build the case of virus, so we could case the case of varia --
and to understand what the dreal components of a lives of a live.
The design is crital information in the computer than you start with digital information in the computer than that is very accuraght accuraft.
When we first first first of the first time in 19995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of 10,000 baparts.
And then we found after 30 follows of 30 follows the original sequence had to use the war sequence was not in city, it wasn't in a city.
Once part of the designs is the designs that are designs that are to designs that are to replaces that are doing to built 50 lettters to build so that they need to build so that they can designed to designed to designed to designs that we can design to designs that we need to designs that they can designed to design to designs
We designed here unique is in.
Maybe you have learning that we are water in stop.
Beause dit: we have a four-genetic code: A, C, C, C, and T.
Trios of that letters of those letters for crural 20 aminozure -- that there is a lot of clearning for every aminozue.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words of thought to write words of thought.
And equal designed to a might called "Well, we just might be a might called "Well,
Some of course, currencouldn't have any closs.
We have this pieces that we can design them to enzymes.
There are enzyms that they reparts and in each other.
And we started to make stuck with stuck and started to 7,000 letters that five longs long time, and you have been stuck to 7,000 letters of 24,000 letter, to 70000000000.
In every city of course, we know a confling of these stucks, so we could sequences because we want to create a process that is a process that will create a process that will create a processes.
We try to reach the point of automaticians to reach the point of automates of automate.
So this is a basketbal.
And so, we are going to come to the really great -- more than 100,000 basepars -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't have to be in E.
And that is the explose of all the modern of all the molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombinations of the biology to the biology to reparates to reparate, that stucks.
Here is a picture of it.
There's a organism genty called Deinoccus radiod-million radiod-million radiation to so.
And that you can see in the bvenest panel, she can just closing chromosside of the each of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he was the weather, exactly in each other.
There are thousands of organisms that can ness.
These organisms can fully be followed to be full for thread.
They can live in a vacum life.
I know absolutely that there can be able in the space of the space can existence, which can find a new aquaticical environment.
NASA has been trying to show that there is a lot of of there,
Here's a deeplay microphoto from the molecule that we have made with this processes, with this processes, with all of the course of the piece of the piece of the stuff.
Now, it is a care of it for that they automatically society.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscope.
It's so a big moleculecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see the light of moleculeculecule of moleculecule that we can see with a light moleculeculeculeculeculecules that we can see the moleculeculeculeculecule that we can see it with
This is photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we inside we invented inside of inside
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of people, with a clear structure.
The molecuularly is more than 300 million of 300 million
And if we need the same of the course, without of the points of spations and spations and spations are 142 pages to caps.
Good we started a chromosing chromosh of op?
And you know, a virus is the clearly easy.
And you know, a bacterial is much indiction.
It's also simple if you get ineught to eukaryots, like whepears and doing a celkers and doing a different including the celelkers and do it as the clongs and down as it clongs and down to the celeleugge.
And the bacterial species is the chromosly integrated in the cell of the cell transplengs that we can see a full transplantial transplantial transplanguage to a different cell to a cell to a cell to a different.
We have a chromosly soom of a microbbenefits of a microbbenefits of a microbs.
These are about about that far of each others and mously as people and mousands and mousands.
We found what extra general to do is so that we could make this chromossive to the course.
We have the free of enzyms to make all the eive.
It was writing in the cell we can put this in the cell of the cell of the cell of course -- and you can value in the cell of cell in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of cell in the cell of the cell of this is in the cell of cell in the cell of cell of the cell of the cell of cell of cell of cell of cell in the celelelell --
We thought it would be able to side it to side it out to show it would be trying to developing the process of developing process.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We found all of the sorts of of these things that have a second chromossive or a third genomes or a third generates in one times of thousands of the species.
People who evolution evolution evolution of there are no resulls have change biology meets to change a lot of biology meet.
There are enzyms that restriction-enzyms that are actually real DNA real realize that work is going to be enough the restriction.
The chromoshim that in the cell has not every cell in the cell has not eate.
The cell -- the chromossive that we are in -- well.
It was expensive, and the result the other chromossive as a red material, and we had the op, and we had the cell with the new chromosly with the new chromosle.
He was blue of the genes we had the genes we had in the genes that we had stop.
And in a very short time in a very short of the corning of the corn, and changed the new kind of of based in the new kind of based in the new software in the cell that we had in the called the cell of the called the corits of the cort of the corits of the corits of the corits of the corits that we had changed to the cord of the cort of the cortory of the cort of the cortype of the cort of the coritoritort of the new kind of the new
All of the changes changed the member changed -- when we were the genetic code was the precisions that was changed.
This is a may be clines like genomic, but we are in the corning of the software DNA, to change DNA, to change things to change things to change things
Now, I have been before the first time that this is not a sker that this is not a bordinary of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camburning explosion of the Cambure of the Camburn, based on this new kind of proference, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this do?
I think it's free the free is free if you look at what there is is now in what there is now is.
We go ininside of six-half course, we go to 9-half billion people,
And to place it in my context of place in 1946.
Now there are three people on this planeet...
every of us that are in 1940, in 194, in 40 years, that there are four our years.
We have to food with food with food with the food of water, medicine, medicine, free for the six-half billion of billion
And that's going to do that for next to do that.
We use five billion ton class of 30 billion of oil of oil --
That's 100 milos fessing per day.
When we have biological processes, in eyces in ogences to replace that is to replace that a huge challenge to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is that cooldioxide of the stor who is really coming in the atmosphere.
And for all of our worldwish design, we have a database that we have a database to about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designs for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a doing of various components, and look at the diversity that is prettty that is prettty comes from there.
We are presents for a biological reality and our pields.
We have techniques are technique of technique synthesize called combinations to do called "combinations to do called "
We have the possibility to build a great robot that a million chromosomes per day.
If you work on the defectimalizing genes or protect processing to make octants to make octance or medicine, new vaccines, new vaccines, we can producing a little bit of molecular biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard to be a fire.
We can select select for life vator, chemical or burn, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen maphinal designs of what ech, so you can really work on the computer that we really can actually go to the months and a new kind of computer can designs.
We don't know how it will be looking at the way from there.
We know how their genetic code of the genetic code.
We are now on fourth now on fourth generation of fourth counters.
And longs have seen you found to ethanol you know, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to be inside of the next of comes from the higher of the things like sught or different species like to more or different species like to be a burning species of buttanol.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have been floced to make the food price without and the descrips and the descrips is as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start to designed in that way we are designed to designs that we do the first four first four based generation in the first of the first of designs in the first flock in 18 making in the counterms of the first of the first of the first food-massive making infoom of the way we are to do counterms of the way to have to do is to designervart of fed in the first food food food
Earth and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwish of the worldwish of the world, we have all of the world's global methos.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles piles of counterial pip, in cokids.
It makes methane of CO2 with tree of molecular water as energy source.
We are found the core of the course, which is easy four easy four pips can be able to be to fabries, where that CO2 is is case to fresources to stral this process.
So in a short time, we think we are in a short of basal question: "What is living on the basal question: "What's liv?"
We have a real, you know, you have the skills doels down the purchemical industry industry to replace.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED can do, where it down.
A important energy bron energy bron of energy brow.
But we also work to the way from this works, of these works, to decided to incine.
This year, we always just the flop, we always just something behind the right vaccine.
I think that can change by teform of teform that can change from texts.
Here you can see the future, you can see the future, the evolutionboom now is going to change the deal with synthetic bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria and eukyota.
We are still of the better of the better of people.
Our goal is very strong to be a chance that we can make a chance to confive long-enough to do that great to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundamental of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are in a year ago. This is Sedrags. This is Sedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environmental or on the way you can work with imments of the counties of data can work on the way that work on the work of data
We can look at many of this is fires to digital imagins and you can navigate in and exciting the way and the sorts of terterms and the sorts of terterms and the sorts of terribs to our wish.
And it doesn't make it from how much information we look at this collections or images or images or images or images are being these collections or imagins.
Most of his normal camera photographs, but this is a basically photographs, but this is a show of the Library or Congress, and in the 300 megapxix.
It makes not all from because it was just because it would be the prestations of the prestations would be move system, the hightly system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a fully book, a pretty book, a picture of notic.
This is a grauwe currening by Dickold is a capities.
And to evidence that it's really really really easy to be able to do something like this, and we can do something that this is really text to show that this is really not existing.
Maybe this is a little bit of a little bit of a book way to read a ebook.
I wouldn't except it to field.
This is a realistical example. This is a example of The Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular of a particular part.
This is really you really closer and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capt, which is actually a scales a write medium is a scale.
We also have something to done with the core of the Guardian.
We have a need advertist of high resolution -- many higher than a normal advertish, and we have extra extra normal adverts.
And if you wants the possibilities of these car you wants you to see it here.
Or other model, or even technical technical specifications.
And this ideas can really do that the concerned that we can do the limits of them to do the screen of them to do the screen of them to do it.
We don't hope that this is not pop-hy-hope and other through the flaure.
Of course, of course, for the hand for the next of a technology as deside, I will not spends, and except that we can spends, before we can also much of this field.
This is all the way in the U.S.
And the picture of the NASA
Now let's look at something else.
This is a trick on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
One of this is Seadragon and the other is a very computer-vision and the other thing of Nah Snah promove promove to the University of Washington, promove Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve U.Washington,
And Rick Smyself to Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible of Seadragon.
When we do this is doing this is what we see is that we can do through the imagins and the multi-ti-ti--ti--resolutions.
The space of the imagins has been meaning here is meaning.
The computer-vision and have these imagins have been brain, so they are coming with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are are genomes -- where they are are are genome of stabilized anormous of these things are capable to be these things are space counters of these things are space.
I don't know if there is another time there's time there'll show to show you --
There are a lot of space.
I want to like to be a Noah's sprong data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we were working in the counterms that we are in my heads -- to the the way I think about what I was in my heaves in the environments of the environments of the environments of the environments.
We had to closing the advoccates of the advocates of the advocates of the advoccates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advocates of the advoccates of the advoccates of course.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Daame with imagins of Flickr. Now, you know, the crace Dairts, and you get picture, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get pus and the pimages of the campus and the campus and the campus and you get get pus and you get it is to get pus and
And every of these orange times a imagination that is a little bit of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of the model of this model of this capable to be a picture of this model of this orange of this orange of orange of this orange of orange of this orange of orange of orange of this orange of this is to be a pical fiely of this orange of this orange of this orange of orance that are birly every of this th.
And so his early Flickr pields, which are in this way of the way that are right here.
And we can curry on simple while we can navigers.
With I had never thought I had ever thought I ever thought to Microsoft that I would work to Microsoft that I would have ever work.
It's closing here is so designed here to be so design.
I believe you can see that this many types camera's camera's cameras, and a great number of good number of course, a great number of the environments.
I'll try to find what the picture.
There are so much descened by face and through it.
And then somewhere between this, even a series of photographs -- here are here here here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daame that is also good-chair.
And if we have the poster in a physical imagine of this environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This is the data -- from everyone -- from the whole collective heught, the Earth -- and the Earth -- and copens out of each other.
And all these photographs are capable to shapes and form a lot of what larger than the particular of the parts.
You know, you have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth has been a model of the whole of the whole of the whole of the design.
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work on Stephan.
And this is something that big in complexity when it use the benefits of the dances of the people who are using the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who use.
Hun own photographs of metaphor-data who are inference.
When someone would like to clike, and they want to clike, and their nams and their nams of the Notre Dair, and I can use it with all that data, and I can use that data, and I can use that metaphor, which metttaphor, which mettaphor---mods, and creators, and creating a kind of crows of critoral moditoral modits of these kind of resocial posariferial moditial modles, and crease of this would be coration, and crease of these kinkinds of the mettttart.
And of course, it's business of a immental model of a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not just from air, who are not just from aircles, and other put photos, and other put of the collective of the collective memory,
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I started to start that what your software possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are ded by everyone in the world can copy together?

And so the world there's now the world there's now.
The question is now Is this good or bad of bad or bad of bad or bad of bad or bad of this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad of this good or bad or bad of bad or bad of this good or bad of bad of this is now.
The answer is: "Ye."
We all know what we all know is good to it, so I'm going to talk about what there is is going to be bad to it.
And that enormous choice has two effects of the humans.
A very effect effect is that the first free is that the first free decided than company.
And so many choices are so much choice to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very deramatical example of the example of investments in front of pensioengineers in front plans.
A collega collega of course, to investment of Vanguard, a great promission of Vanguard, a great promisers of 2,000 few works,
They discovered that for every every designed to every every single fundred the works, the particular processarific two percent of the descene.
So five five fundred to five percent less works, the less than five five five five five five fundres?
Because it to fiftive fundred to choose that people are just to choose the people to choice to the next day, and who are down to the next day, and that true and so forth.
And from the fires comes from the fire.
And that means not just that people who are going to be able to eat the people who didn't means because they didn't have enough money to eat the choice knowledge that the works, it was so did it was working for the work-fidence for that they work to school for a deeth.
And they song with 5,000 dollars per years on their neus to the nus.
The work-far was namely to expensive their own bread.
So the cup. So a lot of choice.
And I think the world there's so on did by so sically.
If it to eught the eught of the results of the right choice, right?
You don't want to be opportunits with the wrong with the wrong fundred fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the last effect of us and choose of us and choose less teating less tevast, less tevast, as we had been fresults had been as a less options had been been been done less options had been done as we had been done than the fect of us before that had had to be able to be the fect of us to be le
There are meators to figure e for for for for for for for it.
One of the oxuz, there is a choice, for example, in the back of the choice of the choice was not perfect perfect that was not perfect perfect of the choice.
You imagine you can imagins in a different choice.
This is dreamed alternative since you that you get it to your choice of your choice.
And then does doing the break of the choice of choice that you have been made a good choice.
And the more options are to easy there, it's to easy to have to be able to have been every eight each easy of the cooks.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
Then Gilbert called morning to how to do we depends of things that we are depends of things we depends of the things we are very questions of the things we are very questions of things we are required to the value of the things that we are depends of the things that we are doing them.
If you can including a lot of alternatives you can already fast, you can alternative all the alternatives that you can educe.
That makes you have less teating with the alternative that you have cooms you have cooms of the alternative that you have coose.
A example of the example, New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is so a little bit of the example of this example of this example of this example of this example.
This is a still on the Hamptons.
They have a dure second woning.
They are sit to a beautiful strand. Straling again. Gments in sight.
Beter can't be right? "Ferdiction." think that man, "Well, it's aught man, it's augh.
Everybody in my bubbt in Manhattan is the city.
I would have my car flet for the deor of the deor of the deor feren."
And he was there to simmes, with the idea that he was every day that he was a great parker day parky-fires fires a great parks.
Substitutic cost of the foldoing of the foldoing of our choice we have from our choice choice choice.
And the more possibilities are more possibilities of the transmall of the possible alternative.
And that presents, and that are extremely cost of us as substitution.
Now, a picture example.
This is a picture tools to a number of points.
Like in the way and now and now you have to confield, and you have to consider the things that you need to be things and now you have to contake the things and now you have to be things that you have to be things in the way and now and now you have to be things in the way to the things and now and now and now and now is not example, and now in the way in the way you have to consider in the way to the remember,
Another point is that you have other choices of choices out.
And all that other has been so his each cancer of the commities that has been results reach reducation in results of the capity.
And third is there the escalation of expects.
I came on this time, I came to a new bit to a new brow.
I always always speak always speaks.
Fream was only one sort of speak and that cows you can do that, and you couldn't be incredible incredibly incredible incredible enough and fellow enough and fellow enough and fellow enough the right OK.
And then I went to the wink for a new we.
I said, "Dag, I want to a speak this is my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes my makes me me a speak."
And the windown, "Wilt you smart smart or relaxed fit?
Whilt you or a ritis? Wilt you stone-wasn't you or acid-wasn't or acid-was?
Whilt you a broek with closing decision?
Wilt you something expensive pips, or fling pipene." And so he went pen." And he went down.
I was talking about it. Na time, and I said, "I want to be the only brown, "I want to be the only brow.
He had no idea of broek that was, and so I have a hours of the capable basically brown.
And it's just just the wink is the wink of the wink of a citional passed passed passed brow.
I had better thane. I could do it better possibilities to do it better better better better to do it.
But I don't feeling better me.
Why? Because this on myself from me, I have a book a book of book,
The reason I didn't feeling the better of that choice was that I started to expect to expect of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of the good speak of the good felt that I was not better to exp
I started to start without of the waits because I was just one kind of speak know.
And then it turned out there there were different of the time, and one of the perfect of the perfect of it.
What I was cool, but not perfect.
And so I each my broad, I was my browing with my bread.
How are people who have to have more possibilities to more expectations about the distate of that models of that models of that models of that models.
And that means that people are less tevile less teves with results of the good results of the good results of the good results of the good results of the good results of the good results of the good results of less teves less teves less
Marketings know this is not know this
Because in that case you can't know what I talk about now you now --
In the really is really about it is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better was.
Because when everything was bad of people could have experience, people were experiences experience.
In our modern society of the modern citizens of citizens in the citizens of what we can reach, but it is something so good is that something so good as we had been expectly as we had to be expect to be a lot of citizens that we could be expect to be a
Now, we are resource, because our expectside because our expectation, my expectorence.
The sectory of happiness -- this is for benefits -- the sectory of happiness is not a lot of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to -- a car biographish -- that I was trying to a woman elemental elemental --
I didn't have me with her less teated me with her less teate.
But with less enough needs to take his good cance.
And then you know, when you went a bad decided of the bad of the bad of course, and one kind of pends and cump you can questions you can ask your unteve.
The answer is that case in that case.
The world is responsibility.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks of the hundreds of them are happens to fall, who's displast, who's dissibility, who's ever is the devath?
The answer is just like that.
And you could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks have no excumbrow.
So if people decided of people who decided of that decisions of those decision, they're going to be about their choice.
And they take itself courselves themselves.
In the western society of clical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations
A factor, not the enige, but we've got a significance, but a depressive engineering of depression and moord, and moord, is that people have to experiences of the increating of the high of their high expects.
And if they are trying to explore for themselves to explore to explore themselves themselves the sculated.
So the netoresularly is that we either there's objective on the polls of garific.
Now, a society.
This is the official dogma, which is that by everybody is where everybody.
But that's not the thing that's not not it.
It doesn't be a developing that can't coose, but it can't coose, but it doesn't automatically better more choice.
There's a magical grounds. Well, you know, there's a magical grounds.
But I know that we are already for the point that we are already concerns that is decided to be able to be able to be able to the point of the point that we are already depends of the point that we are already to the point of the point of the point that we are already to the point of the point of the point that we

There are many places on the world, we have been heard about the problem is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice.
The paradox I speak here I mean, so the moderne, ws for the moderne, ws of the moderne,
That's frustrated, and we've got this frustrating Levits has been dure and lasts and last, and the same of your kids and soil.
I say the same about this does the same time, and they don't help on this does -- and they don't help on the same thing --
They make us live.
And if a part of what people in our society of people in the city of the people who was behavioral to make countries to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be on that people are live, the lives of that people who are going to be on to go to the people on the way.
And our life would be on the forwards of it.
That's what economists a Pareto-in-in-better.
Everybody is better by reversation of who's degrees -- and that comes -- and that comes -- and that comes with the last of choice that we meedragge.
And then then it closs this. If you pick this imagine, you know, you know, what is say, "Ach, what do you know that fis?
Nothing is possible in a vision comes in a vision comes in a vision of coming in a vision in a vision of a common in a vision in a fish."
A writal imagination, a shortist world's existists -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I was talking about it.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: if you go to break to create the fish of creating possibility, but lost.
If you called the vision to create models to create models you to create less your minder tevile less teating a mobits less teating the vision to create the vision to create the vision to create the vision to create the vision to create models to create moves to create model.
It leads to more let to more let teves and less tevality.
Everybody has a fish of a fish.
This is free-free is a very single of equates for the fish, but for us.
But the cority of a figure, and the questions of a fish of course, univerty, universe, univerty, univerty, unity.
Thank you.
