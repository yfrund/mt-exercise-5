Fore year, I showed these two slight showing that the pollish cap, who was about three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent curved was about 40 percent curved in the U.S.
But this is the real realize of this specific problem because it didn't show the disection of the ice.
The ice capital in the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crace in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what the last 25 years of what the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dividual, in red.
As you see, it looks at dark out of dark blue.
That's the year, that's the anything in the winter.
And the crack in the summer.
The so-called ice permanent ice, or five years, is almost like blood, that is almost like blood, that is almost like this.
In 25 years is the from this to this forward.
And that's a problem because the frozen around the Northern Icelebrate came and there, and there's a very big amount of course, and there's a very big amount of carbon methan, when it is frozerned by microbes in methane.
And so, with the total corner of the true of the atmosphere, that would double the corner of the corners.
In some of the deep another deep in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another team down to another undiep member.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be that.
A reason that is that this huge is that this huge "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver of the same aterriver
The waterfull is the water than ever bigger than ever before.
This is the Kangerms of the south South South South South South South South west.
If you want to know how the sea of the sea pigel because it's the landics -- is the place where it comes in the sea.
These streams are flightly to them.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, on the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And the month, scientists that the whole continent now that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the ice of the South Pole, very quickly, with a few substance, with some substance.
The whole continent is standing for six meter six meter of the same pile, like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after biggest ice mass, there are new now there that were new now, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting his drinkwater of that skwater at that skwater at the time.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappear, awing the drink water.
In California was there was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow.
It's coming in the waterres in the waterres.
And as you could read reading them, the predictions of it.
This world was shot sound the world has led to a dramatic stycle.
And the number of nature, of course, around the world is supply and never seen accidents.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at the atch of a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 --
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Keast, why does the every day of Stille Ocean, from America, and every single side every single diase of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is also design for 20 percent money, is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and voice is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extincluding with China.
And there was a previous of more urbing carbons.
But we see a course.
These are the voice carbon cool that the building was annule, in the last years, and where green alternative were proposed in the last few years and where green alternatives were proposed to the benefit of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of
There's a political battle of the country.
The voice carbon and oil industire gave industire 250 million dollars to promots, which is a clear cutting carbon clearning --
And that picture to something that is thinking.
And Rond the charged was home in Tennesse, at the home of billion liters of cition modder.
You probably have seen in the news.
This is the one after the biggest did in America.
This was happened around the Cerst.
One of the aversions of the suburbing carbon the Kerst was done of the Kerst.
Video: "Frosty the cool carbon cool charge is a blice, operating challenge.
He's a lot of the way in America, and he's worth for that our economics grows for our economics.
Frosty the voice carbon man becomes with the day
He's paying and cutble and cutty and worked their job."
Here's a big comes a big part of the cities, in West Virginia from.
The biggest mine of the country is the great biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Do Blankship says, "Let me clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Red, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about them."
Al Gore: So has the Alliance for Cliance for Cliance for Campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
And so "By COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatence for our business.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantic reason to give to the light and the leaves of truth and the realizing of truth of truth of truth of truth of the truth of truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the most im
Fite is not sleed, is not sigate.
We find that clean is -- and it is -- and it smell leake.
So, you don't make care about climate change.
Let me that only our over.
Video: Acure carbon carbon carbon carbonly heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern school clean cities.
Fantastic! The machines machines are what lawyers.
But that's the sound of sound sound of sound sound of songling sound of sound sound of sound sound of sound sound of songling sound of sound sound of slecture.
And at spite the fact that burning burning burning one of the most important causes of the Earth, change the earth is change the remarkable of the Earth, is the remarkable of all of here.
Look at right, this is the clean urbing carbon-today.
Al Gore: Eindemands the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative of national security of national security.
Video: America is in crisishing crisis, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The red wire to all these baks, is our dependence of fossil fuels, as polluts, as piled off.
But now there's a certain, new solution to get this.
And for 100 percent of 100 percent schone electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get again, again, a plan that is a plan that is safe and the warming.
And eventually a solution that is a solution that is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontly.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It's about that, it's about America is to give America.
One of the fastest ways to make an endone on our dependence of old, solic fuels that our planet, to help our planet, to help our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
And then 2: New investments to create 2: New are paid paid pay paid of creating jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speak that says, "If you want to be faile.
If you want to go and get together."
We have to go and fast.
Thank you very much.
Fore year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here's me. For those who weren't the LHC is the most biggest scientific experiment ever subjective ever submers, 27 kilometers in the case of the biggest scientific experiment in the one.
It has to be the circumstances that were less than a billion second billion times a billion times a billion times a second.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors of the tectors I work with the ATLStor detector -- 44 meter -- 44 meter in diameter -- 22 meter in diameter in diameter --
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS, so that you can see the scale.
On 10 september shaped for the first time, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that made a party for a party in the control room.
It's a photograph of the first particle that are all around the LHC should be around the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and particles in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture photograps in 10 September we were saw over, which is a huge overwhose is a huge win.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest right or this, or this, and somebody was going to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make a problem with these golden wears.
Those are wears 13 thousand amper resh when the machine on the full power.
The engineers are you'll say, "No small of you, "Not where. It's too small of dram."
They can do that because they can do superfect on all the low temperature temperature of temperature temperature of temperature to do that because they are superceived to do.
So at multiple 271 degrees of the space between the space between the global that drive stream down.
In one of the connections between the neine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a construction.
And that was that there was something warmer, and there was an electrical resistance against that 13 thousand amps of ample that is thousand ample of ample that was once to be able to be a thousand ample of the wirelectrical reason that was something that was something that was once to be 13 thousand ample of electrical resistance that was ond to be a bundressing that was once to the close to be thousand amp.
This was the result.
This is still impressive, if you realizes that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeter than 20 tons of the inches of the magine.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to put them out of them, what we did.
We all have been repartation.
Now they're back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will put him again, and we expected measures in June or Junli, so that we can go further and expect what the building building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have that incredible sky the debate of the value of science research. It's easy to do research.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard than the LHC.
I leave the last words on the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, during the defence of his learning experiments of his learning was his teaching Michael Farael Farage, and this is what is so dangerous than readvances of human mind than remember to take our science, and that there are no anysteries in the world and definitive that we are completely designs in the completely design that we design, and designing the long definitive our otions of the definity, and then definity, and that we dicame to be complearents of his leart debrivalities are not complearementrivity, and they were complearrivavavavavavath, and
Thank you very much!
I would like to start to ask to ask to ask to your children to go to your children's time, when you play with block.
When you had to figure out how to understand how you had to understand and and aware you solve to learn through the corporation and depended with the counters of space relationships.
Ruimtely is a strong because with the understand because with the understand us.
If an inspired by the nut of physical interaction with physical interaction with objects -- together with my advision -- and my medication with my advision -- what I started asking a computer questions -- what if we were a computer -- what if we could use a computer information in a kind of digital fingerital fingerial fingertic fingertip that we can flate with a plat desicitual with a plate with the burbore breairing breath,
and can orders and as we want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able and as we can want to leave orders and orders can we want to leave orders and orders can we want to leave it?
This question here, we decided that we decided to seek an answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftly a Sift-field's bigge.
They can be able to be able to be able to put each other, they can feel each other, and they can put a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handlectability, as blocks, they can be moving through it down to understand it.
And so many of Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
And so that these tools have a more physical different physical different of their movement, and even of the way we movement and even from the way we movement, and even of the way we move them, and we are like, there are different new and leucks.
I'll start with some simple example examples.
This Siftly, is institute, to try to do a video to do call the way and others and others and others and others and other.
These interactive portraits are awareness.
Indiently, they will be place each other, they'll be interesting.
If they get surrounded this, they can also set this, they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be surrounded this and they can be certainly be certained to be surrounded this and they can be able to be surrounded this and where they can be real.
And they feeling and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting is that we have a small of the interesting of a color was a color as it was a sliqueakly.
In this example of three Siftables for three Siftables and I can use them color in a leavel to go where they are become a leave.
If we have to gotten we go back to what we go.
There are some capable of possibilities for education, pretty play with languages and logics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to try to see things fast. And the result of seeing things show.
Here I ton -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmmmatic programmmatic programmmmmic.
Here we show here is a crosson between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter around a teaching letter to every Siftable, and send words in a dictionary words in a dictionary words in a dictionary in a dictionary of the words.
And after about 30 seconds it is that it's very reshaped to be a new series of letters with a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am it out of the Media Lab, and I was trying to make a video of it.
They were actually really, there's a way from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to be almost no instructions of this applications.
And all you have to say is "Make word" and they know what they have to do.
Here's some other people to test.
That's our young boot solic test, right?
And it seems that he just seems the Siftables --
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting showed to interactive paint.
We wanted to learn a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the scene, by the basically set of the table, with that character of the table.
He let me sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done though! Yeah!
By shake the shape of Siftables and the next to put the characters to reach others -- Video: Weak!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decision how it walks.
Video: The cats flying air.
DM: The last example that I'll show to show that I will show Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have recent recent to be sound a sound sound sound the lead, bass and presses.
One has every one has been foot for which you can choose what you can choose what you want to do is using what you want to do is using it.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are so that you can determined the pattern of them can dependent themselves.
You put a sound in the pattern by the sound of a leage Sift-fill Sift that is available as reverbal available and filter.
They are to a sound and advanced and advancemental to cancer.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are put on the whole pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: We're starting with a lead. We're starting with a lead.
Now I place the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feel what I feel slegal work
Video: There I capture the filter of the filter of the drums, so I can affect the effect live live in the effect of live in the busin.
Video: DM: I can accelerate the celerate of the county of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Now I capable to buy the basic for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can re-re-hold while the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to do everything to plann, but I can improvise improvise and shorter and shorter like I want.
And with the dims of the dims of the dims of the whole Siftly to can't get to left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make my passion to make new people, and I went to make new human computer, in the way our brain and bodies our brain and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of design area of possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is only the capital to a very new generation to a very new generation for the interact with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you to talk to you to all and talk to you to all of you.
I'm writing now.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I'm already to write and I don't think that's going to change that ever change.
And yet there is something that happened in my life in my life and career and career and career with my life and career with my work again.
And it started with a book that I wrote unless I've written a memoire, "Eten, Biinnen," that was very one in my earlier work and an international experience the whole world and an international exists and an international experienced in the entire world and an international experience."
The consequence is that people always have to always does that I always have to be coomed in the cooms.
And what -- it's called where --
People come to me and questions to me and questions that "Don't you know, you can have this success?
Don't you afraid you are not going to be able to keep your entire life writing down to publish where people are going to be heating head.
If you don't have any of that?"
Ery direction, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much for me that I remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- if I told a teenage -- if I told I wanted to be write I wanted to be write that I wanted to be a teenage of 20 years ago.
People said, "Don't you get that you're never going to get success?
Don't you afrather for dealing, that you will go through through it down?
And if you don't you afraid you get your life to this work without of this work without of the broken and that you'll start and then you will strongs on the puin of broken ditters of fail?"
Something in that stread.
In the short comes to the answer, my answer, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afafraid for all of those things that are called
Always the ways of it.
But I'm also a lot of other things that bangly, you don't want to know that all of all of it.
For sea bit of sea bit and other only things.
But what is writing writing myself to the last time that few from, where that feet.
Is it rational?
Is it a lot of that somebody is every eight after the work for the work for the work for the work for the work for the work of the Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of it on the effects of it is that something to work at all.
Now you take my father. He was a skulfather. He was a remember that there was no one in the 40 years that he was asked to him or he was not afraid for a bang for him or he didn't have any there.
And so from "John, how is it with your chemistry block?"
No. And so not worked about it.
And to be fair fair engineers have been fair by the centuries, and they didn't have the reputation of manicician-depressive alcoholists.
Scheever writers that have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation human reputation is a reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation is also that we have a bit of the reputation of the
Look at the grimmic dotty dottal dottal creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died, many of young, often by their own own own to do.
And even those who are not a suicide placed, seem to be under their gave and they have to be continue to be continue to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be suicide of the ones that no suice to be suicide of them.
In the last interview for his death, Norman Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of exciting that we don't look at the same thing.
We all have heard and have heard and have it with the sources of all of accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity is that creativity is involved with suffers and that a artist-edly affected to anybody to ellends.
And so I want to ask everybody here today, can you with that idea of life?
Find you that OK?
Because I'm going to think about that, I think of the whole I don't think of the pretty of the way I think of the pretty of thought.
I find the reference.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century this century.
We can have creative sports a lot of better to live and live.
I know that it's pretty for me, in my situation, in my situation, to be dangerous to live to that dark to that dark though.
See the fase where my career where my career now is now in.
And then young, I'm young, amper of a fired of a year.
I can maybe I can work four decade four decades.
Heastprobably will everything I will have publish through the outside world as the world as it work on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends with this, so I can lapped you, and I can lapping you probably lapping my biggest successfully really, all of the successfully behind me.
But, what a idea!
If you go to think, if you think of the morning to check hours to the nein the morning hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me walked up with the work that I love with the work that I love to love the work that I love with the work where I love with the work where I love to love me song me song me that I love love to love me love with the work where I love to love me love with the work where I love to love me love with the work where I love to love me lo
The question is, "Do well, ""Do wone?"
And after long after a long after the conclusion that I can only go through with writing in the process inbuilding in the process inbuilding in the process inbuilding in.
I have to do during a safe distance safe distance between myself and my over.
I've been looking at ways she was looking at ways to do that.
I have been down in the history and have floors in other societies to see if others a better way to see if others have found creative people to help creative people to help creative with emotional complications of creative process.
My search has been based to the old Greeks and Romeins.
Leah, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romeins believed that creativity was not that creativity was of itself.
Men believed that creativity was a good spirit was a good spirit was a good place to human beings and unknowledge and unknowledge.
The Greeks call these basically called these called "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon who had a demon who had a demp words influisterate.
The Romeins had a kind of equivalent idea.
And in the called a called a geniused creative spirit was a genius.
The funny is that the Romeins with a genius, not a particularly piently person again.
In their policy was a genion was a genion was a geniused in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the household
If the artist, the population was the genius.
And he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise the distance that I had the earlier to the results of your work.
Everyone knew how that in his work in his work to work in his work
The artists was so in protection to protection for example, so much narcism.
If you were working on the bread, you got not every equire.
Everyone knew that was a unseem that a unseem to hold a hold genius.
Well, you work on the work of you, not only that to you.
Everyone knew that you had a pretty unus.
Long time is that we have been considered in the Westen creativity was considered to be considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a very new idea of new idea: the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attackay, from the goddness,
That was the beginning of the rational humanish.
People believy that creativity was completely from the individual.
And for the first time in the history was there about artists that they were said that they were a genius, and not that they did a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that a big fake.
To one person, one person, one person, one person, one is single individual individual human beings is the essentially, the source of the century mysteries, of everything is -- creative and the familiar is something to a fragile human psyche.
As you ask someone ask the sun in slight.
Egos are blowing up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high-expectations and there.
And I think this pressure was the last 500 years a lot of artists of artists have made a lot of artists that has made the last 500 years a lot of artists in the last 500 years a lot of artists that this pressure is the pressure that pressure is made the pressure of the last 500 years a lot of artist.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What is "What now do "What now do that, "What now do that, "What now do that, "What is that, "What do is that, "What is that, "What now do that, "What now is that, "What is that, "What is that, "What is the question: "What is the question: "What is the
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on an older the older of the relationship between human beings and creative mysterious?
Maybe not maybe not
Wellight we can do 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the spech.
Probably are in the audience people who have reversed in the audience of the idea of scientific creatures have been in the work of the feeding of artists of artists to inspiration,
It doesn't seem to get me that I will get to get you all that in that way.
And I ask question I would.
Why not?
Why should we have thought that thought that thought to follow?
It was just so much more highly hold as all the other explanations of the total explanations of the total processed in the creative process.
Everyone who have something that has a little bit has a little bit of creates -- so in fact, so in fact, we know that the creative process is not always rational process -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process --
That sometimes it can almost paranormally feel.
I've been recently design the great American closer Ruth Stone of the fundressing Ruth Stone of the great American disint.
She is in the next that whole life all of life all of life although they directly.
She told me about her jeained on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field, she was a poember to get a close country.
It was so said that so, if there was a big wave wave air skip came to ream air came air and air there.
Searn poem poem wave than the country to her her.
She felt that the ground, she was started shaped to shake her feeling that her at that moment but one thing to do is standing for her life.
She had to go home, followed by the poem and she had to see so quickly, and showing and packing.
When the close was close by her her her her was that her only her any chance to write it.
Sometimes she was not fast enough.
Then running and running and running the house.
And in the moments of the close of shot shaped by her head, seeing the fields, in her words -- to another another closer -- to another closer -- to another closer -- to another close -- in her words -- in her head.
And also there were one anyway, I think -- this is the best part of the story -- that they have the close to the close -- they almost mistake.
And then she was in home to look for and paper and paper, and it was close by her hear.
And Juist on that moment she had a potter than a potom.
And with her other hand, so told me she poeics out the poem from the air.
She package, and she picked up the weather back in her body, while she written the written back and written it again.
In that cases came the close of course that was very put in a paper of paper -- but then in the case of the case of paper --
When I heard that I thought -- what I thought -- what happened, I thought my creative process of creative process ey!
So my creative process is not worth my creative process -- I'm not a medium!
I'm a musile, who are every day on the same time, and sweating up with blood, sweates and trans with blood, sweating and trans through it is a worst.
But even in that daily quareas I have had a experience.
You also know the myself that feel knowledge, that feel that there are creative ideas in your bron from a source that you can can do you can can impossible your impossible of that you can know that you can also know that you can also know that you can also know that you can also know that you can also know that you can also know that there is creative in.
What is that source?
How can we use it without we use it?
On a way that is that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think is musician to be musician --
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time aw.
We had the way to do it here.
And in fact, a big part of his life is a lot of his life the showed of the wonderful that makes from all power to get to get to the unition of the power to get to the unition of the unition that was done in him.
And with the '90s was Tom what was ringer.
And one day he was in Los Angeles over the speeaway, and changed it changed it radical --
And while he was so real, he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided him, as inspiration that is doing, understand that is unfake, unfake, cellent.
It was a beautiful beautiful and he wanted to hold the holds.
But that was not going to be that.
He had no paper -- no taperecorder to paper and no taperecorder to them.
The amazing exciting exciting exciting exciting the melody of heaven, and then it turns me to be following me to follow.
I'm not good enough, I can't ay."
He didn't have real real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind it do?"
"Do you really think I can real song that I can get a song of song?
If you really want to get that song that song you, you have to get later another thing that I have to have time for you.
Now, it's not going to be a little else difficult of fall.
Go neighborhood-neighborhood." And from that moment of the process of the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar subject is a family subject of dark subject is still the dark of the familiar subject is the work of the same thing,
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him referred to distanced the distanced of the genius.
The genion was to close on the skin and listed only close to the skin and also only close to the skin and listed only close to the skin and listed to be a close to the skin and skin him only close to the s
And then then realized that there was no reason that was to go through through through it.
It could also have a wonderful, bizard as a wonderful, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own aspect that was not very much of Tom was that not very much of Tom was that not very much of Tom was a wonderful, a kind of a wonderful
That story has changed my way of work changed.
I've already have been profitting of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddy, Biddle, Biddle.
On a certain moment I fell in despair.
You know, you know, you don't want to get to work and you won't do good and you think it's a terrible disastrip. It is bad book,
Not summity, really horrible is really horrible bad of bad bad.
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of the whole project.
When I remember Tom those who was too to be a point to be a point to way.
I wish me from my manuscript and I was a leaving to a leave of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room of the camer's room and I wish to a leave of the camertainly wish of my manus
And I said, "Listen then, we know all this, we know everything, we know everything that if this book, it's not just through me.
You can see I have all in the stop I have in my off.
More I can't give it.
If you find that it have to do better than you've got to do your do.
Snap you don't you that? Do you don't know that.
I just write down because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notles are avoid to be him that again, you know, we've got to can't be difference."
Tjainally, the comes here, it's coming here.
Euws came up in the North African desert African desert people to dance to dance months to dance a sack music music music.
One and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always great because the dancers were full professionals.
But sometimes sometimes a lot of something that happened.
One of that dancers was transcendent.
You know, you also know what I mean, you know, you also have some of that I mean, you know, you also have seen a performer.
It was as if the time was standing standing and the dance of the cition of a poor.
He didn't did anything else than the thousands of nights, but now everything.
And suddenly he didn't have a human beings only a human being.
In him, under him, under him, under him.
A good fired fired him.
If that was something that was going to be able to do what it was Dan they started to clapping and they started class and cooking, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because that was the way to them.
By way, a fun fact historically fact historical fact that was the Moren Spane Spanely Spane Spanely Spane Spane.
The question is real through the centuries, the centuries, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, other, Allah, other.
And that hear you hear today to died, you know, that the day and flamengodances.
If a pance in Spane something impossible or magically, "Allah, other, other, Allah, broad."
Oh, understand souldy, s: a glimb of God.
People what we need to need.
Lastig is that the dance of the following morning to the discovered morning was discovered to the next morning for 11 hours of the morning more direction.
And at that moment is he is going to be a little bit of elder with past, that maybe never to such more of such chight?
Maybe never going to be anyone God anyone God attackay.
What to do now what to do now to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show to show to show for a creative spirit for a creative spird.
But so painful is not need to be so need.
Imagine that you don't have that the most unusual aspects of your person is to get to yourself.
Imagine you believe that you believe them a while, she was a while, not a bit of specifically source.
When you ready is ready to somebody else.
So that's how everything.
I handle inflying thought of thought to me.
The last months I've been working on a book, which is going to be able to see. The book, and book where many reach reach to have been looking at is expansion to be looking at is a book,
The realize of that illusts are forward progression of that illust.
If my thoughts to go on the hold with me on the hold of the hold one, I don't think of the same thing that you don't have anyway.
Do just the way you get your work.
Blick just your doing, what's the thing that is also there.
If you get your task is to dance.
If the good genion that you is replace to decide in your work on any of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources through to leave through the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources that you is to get to show you in your work in your work on any of the wonderful that you is to get to be
Thank you very much more than anything happens to through that.
And also then, "OK.
I believe that I believe that heart.
"OK, whatever it is because we pure from pure human love and own wisdom by stay and own and wisdom through the corn.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol.
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean of genome and what that can meaning, and the discovered.
We started actually starting to go from a new point of point, we were the biology to the digitalize of that digital code to a new fase in biology to go to a new fase in biology in biology in biology and synthetic synthetic and synthetic them.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is something I think about what I think is something that I think a lot of biologists have trying to understand on different level.
We have different approach again, the back to minimum the back to minimum components.
We're now almost 20 years of digitions.
When we have sequenced, it was going to be sequenced, it was from the basically world of the computer, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask question: can we regenerate new life to create new life of creating new life of ital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of small multiply in a laboratory in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look at a nonce or we can get a smaller genome.
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so, that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relatively simple with the understanding with the unction.
That's what it's simple, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can probably explaining that this would be a living cell cell cell that would be able to live cell up and living on and revideo to reduct all of the genes that we can look at a lived cell that we can look at the one of the genes that we can get a live cell that we can probably
We decided that the only route pretty was to sychromosphere, so we could have this chromosphere, so we could have the components to be so that we could make the components to ask the components of the most fundamental questions of questions to ask this chromospeaking.
And so we started to questions that "Can we started a chromosome of synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic as well.
Stail the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, a chromosing a chromosly start?
A chromosome, by the way, is a piece of chemical inert.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of the digitalize is accelerating on exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic codes lose slowly, but is alslowly, but is along as well.
And our last point would be in this moment would place in a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of course, to start with a biodia for a bio-ethical tools of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very difficult.
There are dozens of powering machines in the world that little pieces of DNA makes, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you.
So we had to do a new method to society for the society of these little pieces and corrating all the phants.
And this was our first pogall, starting with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces, the correction, the phoutcorrection.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of chemical stopts, and the bacteria stop, and the bacteria of genetic code to reads, and viral particles make viral particles make it makes.
The viral particles were locked out of the cells, they were out of the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unless the oil industry, and I said that she was a bit of good showed that model only captimes.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which is a situation where the software in a biological system.
But we wanted to go to something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so that we could figure out the cassettttes of varians.
to understand what the real real components of a living cell components of a living cell cell of the cell of the age.
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer,
When we first put it together this genome was in 1995 was the standard of the standard-precision is one fakes 10,000 base.
And we found the resequency we resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had used sequence to start to start to start to start to start to start start to start start to start to start to start to start to start the original sequencing cuts.
And the design is the design is the design is the design of pieces that have to leave all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller so doing smaller to build smaller so that they can go together.
We design unique to the bottom of this.
Maybe you read ready that we read waters that we put water in stop.
There is this: we have a squarter genetic code: A, C, C, Gend, and T.
Trios of those letters of coders for back 20 aminozers -- that there is a only touch.
So we can use the genetic code to use words to write words --
And in the called "The called "The course,
Some of them were calls that there were no poemmight be poems that there were no poems
We have these pieces that we can design them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and they put in each other.
And we started to make pieces of them and start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters that were long and you have piece of 24,000 letter, and you piece of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stages we have a flow of these pieces of pieces of these pieces of pieces because we want to create a process that is very robust.
We try to reach the point of automatial.
So this is what it looks like a basketbal.
And as we come to come to the really big pieces -- more than 10,000 baseparates -- then they don't grow easy more in E. coli.
And that is the experience of all the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to say to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that we know a homologists called "homologe of the biology to repay DNA and repairs can feet.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million raid to raid shed the raid of can.
And that seeing you see that in the top panel, she can just certainly certainly on each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he was put it back in each other, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can completely opposed to be completely imposed to be completely regions.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can live in space that there can be life in space that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has show that there is a lot of this, there's a lot of of there.
Here's a basic microphoto of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually made with these processes -- actually using with the right design of the right design of the right design of the pieces that we were in the right in the right of the corner that we were in the forced with them.
Gist makes that they automatically society.
This is not an electronen-microscope photograph; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we have indeed.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule ever made by human structure.
The molecule-boot is more than 300 million.
If we would present the cross of the points letter, without spations without spations -- it's just to present 142 pages of the genetic code away to pressure the genetic codes away to presses.
And, how do we started a chromosome of the chromospher?
And with a virus is the clearly easy easy.
And with a bacteria is a lot of complicate.
It's also simpleer if you put down under eukaryots, as we just put it the cell and doing another in, and that's what you know if you know is all knowing as the clong.
And the bacterial species is the chromosome of the chromosphere, but we have show that we have a full transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosing a chromosing a chromosing a full transplant to another, and it can active active.
We have a chromosphere, we have a chromosing of a microbs.
These are about so far as far of each other, as people and mick might be as people and mick mile.
We feed what extra general so that we could have a chromosphere, so we could select select to select a chromosphere.
We have the tools to make all the egs to make all the egs to make all the egs.
It was pretty when we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the very avanced graphical images -- the very available graphic images -- the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to be able to come to show you out the process what we were trying to develop process what further than developing out of developing it would come to develop the process.
This is a essential evolutional mechanism.
We have all sorts of all sorts of chromosome of chromosphere, or a third general thousands of them, which they have thousands of properties in one times of the species.
People that evolution evolution as if there is one of the same thing that has not been a lot of biology not have a lot of biology that is not a lot of biology that evolution is not change.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that are actually called DNA fire.
The chromosome, that was not either.
The cell -- the chromosome, that we stop in -- well, well, well.
It was expressive, and the recognize the other chromosphere, and therefore as a strange material, and therefore we had only the cell with the new chromosphere.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time aways disappears of the characteristics of the one species, and changed it in the new species, and software that we had in the cell software that we had in the cell software that we stop in the cell had stop.
All the same thing changed changed -- when we changed the genetic codepended -- when we read was the precise was changed.
This may sounds like genomically as a genomic, but we're in state, by change the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental -- to change things fundamental chemistry.
Good, I have paid earlier that this is not a creation -- this is not a charge -- this is a billion years earlier year, and I have pay that we may be able to be able to be almost a new version of the Camble of the Camburie, and I have been based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's free to what is free if you look at what it is necessarily to what it is.
We're going to get insix--half to go to 99-half to 9billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to place in 1946.
There are three people on this planets.
every one of us who lived in 1946; within 46, that are four in 46, that are four four in 1946;
We have a lot of food with food with food with food, with cleans, fuels, fuels, fuel, basically for the six-on-half billion.
And that's going to be a lot of doing that for nine to do that.
We use five billion tons of colls, more than 30 billion tons of oil.
That's 100 milos per day.
When we have biological processes in ogencous process than anything to replace that is a huge challenge challenge challenge.
Then there is of course, all of course, there's all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is already of course, there's all of course, there's all that carbon the atmosphere in the atmosphere is of the cool dioxide of that carbon diob comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming of the carbon the atmosphere is coming carbon dioxide
And though our worldwide discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industrial components, and look at the diversity that has been coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the electronics.
We have been represently realized by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have technique so, thank you very quick fast, to do combinations of called combinations of doing combinations of doing that.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think of 20 million different genes of thinking, or protect processes to optimalize octan, or medicines to produce or medicins, we can produce with a little team of team biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular than in science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life vatable chemical or fire, chemical or production, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design real of what real design is that we work on the computer can go to the computer and a new kind of design on the computer.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code there.
We now focus on fourth generation now
One of you have seen flying to ethanol face anol face.
We have second and third generation and third generation will be from coming from sugar, as sugar, as sugar, as a different fuels like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology is that big large influence without the food price and the available is when we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food forever in that way that we have the first foodle, and we think we are the first fourth generation of the first generation enables.
Sumble and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have describe in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea half miles deep, and a half miles deep, sot sot of temperature --
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We can take the way if we can take CO2 we can take a pipels vileft through the fabries, where that CO2 is back to fabried back to fired this process.
So in a short time is we think we think we are able to expensive that we are able to break on the basic question: "What is life?"
We have the society, you know, -- have the society of the purpose industrial.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where what do is well?
A important energy source are being source to be source.
But we also now we're also now to use these tools to think of these tools to think of these tools.
This year was the flu was always just something behind the facts of the facts of the parts of the right now in the right vaccin.
And I think that can change that can change through of testing vaccine.
Here you can see how the future of it can go out of the future that the evolution is going to change the end, accelerate with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually evolution.
We're always away from the improving people.
Our goal is to suppose that we make a chance to survive a chance to do that may be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we were in a new technology that we were in a way to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment that you local or on the immense of the basically or with immense fish data can work on the way that you can work on the basically or on the immense of the cal.
We look at this lots of gigabyts, and we can see here and can be able to keep on the digital images and out, and example, and then it looks at our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how large these collections or images are images.
Most of this is normal digital digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixally foot in the 300 megapixally reach.
It all doesn't matter because the only thing because the only thing would be affected in a subject system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of the picture of data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Every collect is a chapter.
And to prove that it's actually too, and not a picture to do something that is really we can do something that is really to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a slight way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't reach it to be attackay.
This is a realistician, this is an example. This is an example of the Guardian.
Every great imagination is the beginning of a bottom part.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capts, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also have done something that we have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have made a nep resolution -- a lot of higher resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising information -- and we have extra information information information information information information -- and we have extra lot of advertising a normal resolution -- and extra lot of adversising advertis
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see, you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the continues of handled the screen through the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other through the other thing.
Of course, of course, for the hand a hand on a hand on a technology as these, I will spent to this field, except that we can also spent a lot of this, except that we can contribute to this fields.
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And then the picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is a marry now on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who is called Photosynth,
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision through Noah Snah Stnahington, and affecually promoteve by Steve Seitz on Steve Seitz on U.W.
and Rick Sself Sself Research. A beautiful society. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's made the possible of Seadragon.
When we do this, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images pictures that they are coming up with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of stabilized diasht of stabilized diasht of panorms of these things are space things are space all these things are spacease.
I don't know sure or there's a time of time there, other environments.
There are much more space that are more spaced.
I want to like to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth of Photosynth -- to work in my head is the real power of this technique of technology in my head of environments on our website on our website on our website.
We had to love to love with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dames with Flickr. You just seeking the Notre Dame, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in tool.
And each of these orange monkeys gives a slight of this models of the models of this model.
And so all of Flickr images, which are in this way of space in this way space --
And we can get on the simple of every simple way of navigeration.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever thought I would ever work at Microsoft of Microsoft that I would work at Microsoft of Microsoft of the Microsoft of you.
It's overwhelmmands of that is so much to be so much to be so much to be so much of this is so much to be so much of this is so much to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so far as to be so far as to be so designed so much to be so design.
I believe you can see that this many types of camera's cameras, everything from good to mirroras, a big number of them, and society of them.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much covered by facial through faces and everything.
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here's a series of photographs -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame, that is also cheained by the program.
If we put through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can actually do things with the social environment. This uses now is the data of everybody -- of the whole collective memory of the whole of the whole -- and bucks that everything to each other.
All these photographs are being a very larger than the shapes of the parts.
You've got a model that from the whole Earth is the earth of the Earth.
And that was a polar on Stephen Lawler's work on Stard.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it use when it use and also the true of the people who are grow for the people who use it.
Their photographs are being metaphor-data that somebody else data that somebody else somebody else.
If somebody would like to attack and they would like to click and inferred, my photograps of the Notre Dase, and I can use as a rich, and I can use as use as a access to that space as a access of everybody -- and created some kind of photos, and creating a kind of crump experience.
And of course, is the break product here, is a rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from air photographs, and satellites and other pictures is design and other papplicative memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I start to start that what your software possible in the next years, all the images that are part of the images that can buy together on the world can buy together on the world together?
BAA: Yeah. What this is really doing is discovered.
The creates to your wish, hyperlines between picture.
And the does that base of the data in the imagination.
And that is really, that is exciting when you think about the wealthy of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
When you look for the web looks for images, you look for a search of the reference ine, and the text on the web, and the text of the image of what the image is far about what the image referre.
What if now that is that picked up to all of your image?
And then the number of the cornal networks, and the amount of the corner of that, and the amount of that comes from getting gigantial. It's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible incredible incredible ad.
One of the intense place of the intense of eating eating eating the possibility to live between them, and they don't forget to forget to forget their past, who are felt their past, the profitters in regard in the wind, the profitters of bitterns.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still still the Milky shape of Iner-parents, or that the myths of Iner-olders of Iner-eldering boodhist sounds, or that in the booddhist on the boodht of Dharma, you really remember to the breath, and remember, and remember, is not in a absolute singly, but is not in a absolute single of world of world -- but is not a boomboot of the world of the worworld in the working the world in the world in the world of the boomyth, but it's not sountoodoedrakility, not soundank of the boot souncounternond th, not sount soun

Of course, we all shares the same tackay, we all share: Worth born children in the world.
We all make increase increase rites.
And in the innovital separation of the death,
So it can't be surprise that we all sings, dancing and art art and art art and art art and art art that we all have then.
But interesting is the unique is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance is the uniqual culture.
Or now that is to get the Penan in the wouldn't have the Vood-acolia -- or the fight-break in the Kaisut-wool, or the Curandero in the Andes-benefits in the Andes-based or the Caravanced in the Sahara. -- this is the man with the deserathrough -- or now a monthy month, a month required through to the hells of Qomolangle --
Everest, the goddin-in-mother mother of the world.
They all us to think we can think we can think we can think we can think of other, otherwise to earth.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea of hope.
Samen shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her and for her as the biological life web is as important.
This cultural living web you imagine your imagine as a eeth.
The eater of the corporation of all the way of thought of all the way of thought, dreams, mythes, mythes, mythes, and intuitions that are inspirations that are intuitions that are intuitions of our consciousness.
The eater is the big nalato is the big nalato ship of human heid.
And she's the symbold that we can be able and all that we can be amazing and all of that we can be amazing news sgive species.
like the biosphere is a slight is the eattack is the eath of the basically -- and still in much larger mate.
No biologist would be able to be able to be able to be least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of the type of the basically state, because that simple.
And justice that, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the lost indicator of the long of the casions.
When everybody here was born born was born there were thousand languages of the Earth.
A language is more than her words, or her gramatic rules.
A language is a language of human souly.
It's the value that the souldn't have any unique the souldn't be material world world is reached the material world that the material world that the material of every unique of every unique cultually.
Every language is a century old spiritution, a separation, a separation, a picture of spiritual possibilities.
And from that sixth of thousand languages today the day of that children are flistening in children flistening.
They are not learned babies to learned it.
Effective means that, unless they're a change that they are already already to be already anyway.
Is there something that is that we have to be able to be able to be the last of your people, the last of your people, and the last of the ancestors of the ancestors of the ancestors of the rewards?
People that is somebody is somebody anywhere somebody is anywhere in the every two weeks and with him every two weeks and with him with him and with him with him the last letter-fires of an old language.
Some of you say, "Well, the world don't have better place if we all the world are speak?" I say, "Super, I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba needs.
Or Kogi." you realize your ogic realize how it would not be able to speak your own language.

The truth is that the 20th century is not remember to be remember or technology is not to be the time as a which, but earlier as a time where we were stunched in the mass of biological and cultive eive and cultures of biological and culture.
All of cultures have always to a dance with new life to a dance with new opportunities.
And the technology is also not the problem is also the problem.
The Siously, the Siously, they didn't have Sious, when they gave their pile, and they gave their pile, as the Americans stopts Americans were stopts to be Americans and way.
It's not change or technology that technology that is the integrity of the eater of ethreat. It's powere.
The wire of government.
Where you also look at the world is not the lock of these cultures to away, and again.
These are dynamic living, whose existence is designs by identifieds, that are powered by identified possibilities real.
Or this is to be the enormous design in the home of the Penan, a nomadical South Asian enorganization in the walk and with the forest generation in the walk and now is to service and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see that the rivers, where you can see that the rivers the rivers of Borneed with the rivers of Bornew to the Sustick to the South require Seath, where Japanese way, where Japanese way, where you can see that the South fultive to the readd vart of the Sured fulate to do smarks, where you can seeart smarkiliting hore of the bore clianese fultriversmarks,

And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Do we have a fieldly live in a colorrise world of diversity or we want to have a colorrich world of diversity or anyway?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead said that she was peace that she was a local world that we have a picture of the world's picture move.
We wouldn't only see the human imagination are reviewing to a smal, moditions, but we would have also forget there and forgets that there are other options of options that there are also exist.
We can feel our nederstand for us feeling that our species is about 150,000,00000,0000,000 years.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave us to transmited us to transful, and the potransing of the shaman replaced by the proza shaman replaced by the specialization of specialization, and we have a scary through specialization.

If the cultures of the world to be the meanings of human beings are asked to 10,000 different votes of voice emerges.
And it's in that song that we can figure out that is to discover and they will figure out what we are, a folscary of the world, that all the teaches and all the garbagins and all the garbaging.
This photograph to the northern point of Baffin Island genomes, when I went with Iner's narrowing with Iner's narrowing on the narrow.
This man, Olayue, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.

It's independent area. They real. They result all the grounds.
It's a connection of how a native example of how a native enough to her people can be able to be able to be able to off.
And finally, I think it's obviously clearly at least for who to go to this home to this home of the world is not really really far away away away away.
They're somebody's home country.
They're going to be able to put the human imagination, that go back to the begin of time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just as that of the unclear, part of a unction, part of the hope.
What we finally do to National Geographic, is extension of the idea that politicians never reached to be something that politicians
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic -- we think that a polet of polemic -- we believe that stories can change the world, which we probably the best stories that are probably the best of 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on a millions of through a millionen-public.
We make a lot of resources to the eath of the eath with our audience, to such a purpose cultural places, where the true that the true so inmition that hope so that hopefully set of anthropology will go to the most important opently, that these world is going to be in different way, that this world in different way, that we can find in a multiplore and ready plure and plure and readistic world that we can get plure and plure and readvancd, we can get plure and plure and readvalistastancultually plore and ready plore and to livalistencultivalistastancult to ready plor
where all the wisdom of all the way of the people can contribute to our behaviors are wonderful to be able to contribute to contribute to the contribute to us.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question that I have a few question I have a book,
Maybe you see you can see parallelts with information from other sources.
And I also try to explain that I may be faith,
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precise: the official dogma of all of the West, industrialized society society.
And that official dogma lima limber as follows as following our citizens on the highest level, we need to get them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a lot of good, a bunder, a essential part of the human exist.
And so basically freedom to reach our own insight, to account a higher wonderful to reach without human without inment.
The ultimate freedom freedom, we find in choice.
Morchoices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedomic means automatically more wonderful wonderful.
This is so deep in our society in our society that nobody would have been durven to drave drive that nobody would be done in our society of the society in our society that nobody would be so deep in our society in our society in our society in our society in
And in our lives in our lives is this dogma stance.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice freedom.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even thressing.
And so that 175 can-bon-break through that 175 can't be in my supermarkets are virgints of extra-virgins and 25 different balsamicos and a different balsary.
And that was that you can make number own dressings for the case of the case of the case of you.
So that's the pick of my supermarket.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can imagine stroneoset of the game pile, speakers, cassetttespier, cassetttespiler, radiverster.
And if you put that one electronics of the electronics of this attack.
You can see some six-half million different systems together, with subject of these are parts of that mall.
There is a lot of time, you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young was, you could go and call sorts of callery, you could all all sorts of callery, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't listed it out. You don't show it bought it.
That had the pretty that was never ever experience.
That time is the time for the time.
And now there are lots of different still state.
And for the cell phones is the diversity is the diversity is immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the toolst -- that was with myright now and crise and crenebrbring crise and crusy so.
And so, you know, you have this model in the wink, but you can see there is not very much of the wink of that happens is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a bunch of the wink of this model in the wink of the wink of you.
The consequence, people come to the winel and ask this question.
And you know how the answers to that question that question that question to the question that question to that question that question to that question to that question that question to that question to that question to that question to that question to that question that question to that question to that que question of the question that question that question to the answer.
No.
It's not possible to buy a possible that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the point of spulls, is this explosive together is a party of choices of choices is a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. incepts, and that you go to the doctor, and that you tells you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do that, we can do that.
Again, this has this privent and nath.
And then the obvious and then what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokic, what do you?"
And the doctor, "As has this pretty and nath, and they did.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Day, if you was me to do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you right."
And that call we call "own incredible of the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, in fact, that the heavy of decision of the corporation of the doctors -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctors -- to a sick of secures -- the patient to take the best condition to take the best continue of recept medicatient to get a lot of reclassemble medical resources --
Good considered that sleets that ners, because the goal, you can't buy it.
Why do we make them, if we can't buy themselves?
Because they think we think we are going to be the next morning our doctor to ask that other markay.
Our idents, yet a engineering aspect of our exist, is now over-away of choices, as you can see on this slights.
Our identity is going to be able to learn from our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we can only find ourselves.
Every morning to the every morning to be thinking what for person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that free everybody else everybody else, that you know, you know, as quickly, and then then you can be so quickly, and then as quickly, and then as quickly.
The only real choice was not when and what you didn't do any when and what you did doesn't do anywhere you did doesn't do anywhere and what you have didn't do any anyway.
Now is freedoms everything for the opening for the opportunity.
I give lesson to a particular intelligent students, which I had 20 percent less househomework on the corporate of the corn.
They don't have dam, or slight than in the early time.
No, they have pressure to make it with choices.
"Well, I don't know if I fail?
Or I'll wait? Now, I am to children, or a care?"
These are all the way of questions.
And they go through to they've got a answer, if this means they don't get all their homework and there’s not good food.
And they have right. These are important questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave already that technology is still us to work every minute every day -- and then the world -- except in the Randolph of the Randolph ph in the Randolph ph of every minute that technology is also --
There's one place I love secret hold, where WiFi the does.
I don't sleep because I want to love that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice freedom character in that we are still wonder, or we whether in the way, or we're going to work or now.
We can look at a football wedge, with our cell phone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop of school.
And even if they all get out of state, are we all state, every minute of that wead, "Well, I ask all sorts of question: "Well, I think this phone call sort of this, "Do I think this phone caller?
And I write on this emailtly, all I write letter?
And even if the answer, "Ne" is, experience we experience the footbalwidstrial of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at it, the small, the small, materialistic base, life is a question of choose is a question of choose --
So the world was early looking at the world there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now is now there.
The question is now Is this good or bad or bad of this?
The answer, "Yes."
We all know what we all know is good about it, so I'm going to get what is is going to be bad about it.
Those enormous choice has two effects, two negative effects,
A very very contrained effect is that the earlier is working than completely than completely than the real.
And with so many choices are possibilities to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice of choice as much choice as much choice as much choice possibilities that are the choice to make a choice as much choice as much as much choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the research for investigations in free to investigure.
A colleaguary had access to investment to investment data of poldid a big polician, a big policy society of working about 2,000 vestigations.
And she discovered that for every 10 promise promising the worker fundred the worker of the particular percent two percent of the too.
And in fifty fundred down 10 percent less work with five five five five five fundres?
Because it's like to choose fundress fundress is to choose that people just experience to the next day, and that opened up and so on. And that was there, and so on.
And of the basically comes from the point.
That doesn't only that that people have after their pensionate not dream dream because they don't have money because they don't have money knowledge of the choice knowledge she was working for the working that she was working on the worked in the work of them shoots.
And that was that they walked to be 5,000 dollars a year, for a year to go to their nose for a year for the way to go to the same through 5,000 dollars a year.
The worked was namely was clear to double, to double.
So in a lot of choice can work with a lot of choice can work
And I think the world that the world through that looks like this.
If it to get the century, you want to get very love, you want to make very love the right here?
You don't want to sit with the wrong with the wrong fundressing fundressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that if we distribution of us and choose and choose and choose enditional less text with the result of the result than the result of the case would be less options as we had less options as we had learn the less options of our casional than the result is that we have been leave.
There are multiple of reasons for that.
One is that there is a choice, for example, for example, for example, that can keep doesn't keep the choice was not perfect perfect that was not perfectly in the couple of the choice of the choice of the choice of that is that there was a choice of choice is that the choice of the true of thing.
You put you in such sense, you know, a different choice would be better better.
And this is thream alternative sheet that you get speak to you.
And speakes break on the following of the choice that you have made you a good choice.
The more options of easier to have easier to have the speak of easier to have easier easier to have every element of the cooks.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
And then then Gilbert gave from morning to how often we have the value of the things that we dependent dependent of the things we equivalue.
If you can in, many alternatives of all alternatives already soon as a regular alternative that you went to write of all alternatives that you went to the way.
That makes you have less tevalternative that you have choses.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a bit of the example of this example.
This is a basically in the Hamptons.
They have a expansion of the second woning.
They are a beautiful strange. Straling again. Straling again.
Don't be able to do it? "Ferdikic," thinks "It's augghtly thinking: "It's auggitor.
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of it.
I could park my car for the door, I could parking."
And he is too simply simply with the idea that he was a great park of the idea that he was a great park faul.
Substitutives to go to cost of the entire ost of the engineer, even if we make a great choice of our choice.
The more possibilities are there, dies to be more attractive alternative.
And those presentation cost.
Another example of the example.
This pictures to a number of points.
Life in the here and now and now that you don't have to hold things that you should not be over.
And another point is that you have every choices of the choices are except.
And all that other has so be so many cans, which the cooks, which the geckobviously option is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this is at my search to a new broek.
I always always always speaking.
And we went there was only one species of the kind of speak and that bough. It was not a bough. It was incredible incomfortable, but if you were the brows long enough and often the broed, and often enough, bask enough, and often the right only OK.
And after years I went to the winel for a new one.
I said, "Dag, I want to do a speek, this is my makes --
And the mally, the mally, "Wilt you fit is fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you know if you have a rits? Wilt you stone-was?
Do you have a browed with slide?
Well, you know, you know, you know, walk out of pipelle, or flass." And so went down.
I was speakes from it. And I was said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to go to there."
He had no idea that was that was and so I have a long all the possible broeks all the possible broed.
And I mean, I left the winel ended up with a browing pass a browing pass brow.
I had a better thing. And I was doing all of those possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To do this to me, I have a book.
The reason I not feeling that I was not feeling with all this choice, was that I started to expect more expect speak of a good speaking.
I started without any expectation, because I was only kidnessed a break know.
And then then there was a different of different and one of that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a different of it.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I mean, I mean, my broek with my expectation, and that stalk me told me to me.
The more opportunities have more opportunities to be expectations of the services of that possibilities.
And that means people are less tevile with results, even if it good results.
Marketingle don't know this.
Because in that case I don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really is about it.
Everything was better when everything was better --
Because when everything was a bad of people could have pretty pretty surprising experience.
In our modern society can be as welfaring as a citizens of citizens and we can reach is that something so good as we can reached is that something so good as we had ever expected to be so good as we had to reach expectation.
Never be, we are surprising surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torents.
The secret of happiness -- here's all of happiness -- the secret -- the secret of happiness.
And I want to ask here -- a little bit -- a little bit -- that I am with a woman elemental elemental -- that I was fantastic is a wonderful basic is really fantastic is --
I didn't have her with her textist with less ted.
But with less enough with less enough, and the good cans.
And finally, why you get a bad sit is a bad sit bad sit as one kind of bad as one kind of pass and you can ask you questions why you're unteving.
The answer, in that case simple.
The world is responsible -- you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broed, and you buy buy available and you buy to fall the time, who is responsible responsible to responsible again?
The answer, the answer, is just as simple. That's the you.
You could make a better choice in a better choice.
With hundreds of different break to fail.
So if people decisions, even as the results of those decisions of those decisions, they're standing around their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western society sound clinical depression of the boy generations of the younger generations of the western generations of the western ship.
A factor -- not the one, but a significant factor of this explosion of the explosion and self-murder, is that people have so often television and itself-eurbing experiencements.
And if they try to explain that call themselves to explain, they give themselves themselves.
So the netoresult is that we have objective in the objective on the felt of down, but our bad is bad of the bad of the bad of the bad.
And another ship, a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to get to where everybody to get to tack for everybody.
But that's not the one.
It doesn't choose does not have choose better than choose is not a carbon the bottom is not automatically that is more choically better is more choice to be more choice is not automatically that can choose more choically than that.
There's a magical fline possibilities. Well, I don't know that.
But I know that we already along the point that choice is that choice to be wonderful for the point of the point that choice for a long time.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost close -- a principle -- a principle -- a principle --
The choice freedom in industrialized countries from material overfluence.
There are lots of places on the world, we have heard earlier earlier is not so much choice is not too much choice.
The paradox I was talking about here, so with the name for the modern I was going to speak to the moder.
That's frustrated, and there's frustrating this: Steve Levitt has been told and distious and children and children's children's basically not helping your money.
I say the same thing, the same thing, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help it. Ergl: they're direction.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society of the people in our societies of these choices to make countries that people have to have been options of the people have to be able to be able to move on the previously of those people in the forward of it.
And our lives would go on the presentation.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement is call a Pareto-improvement
Everyone is better by referty of wonderful -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choice that we have with our foot with our foods.
And then then you have this picture, if you read this picture, you'll ready human say, "Ach, what do you know fish from it?
Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A wral imagination, a short-sight-sight-same global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the thing I was understanding that this fish is desibly dealthy.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you are the fish, you don't have the fish, you don't have freedom, but again, you don't have freedom, but again.
If you put the fish to create possibilities to create possibilities.
It leads to more lost to more leader.
Everyone has a fish to call the way of need.
This is a certain to limited -- possible for the fish for the fish, but for us.
But the ways of a figure, the way, of a figure, is asking to ellent, ineer, difficult -- unhead.
Thank you for your attention.
