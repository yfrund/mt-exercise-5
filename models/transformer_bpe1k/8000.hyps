We re@@ al@@ iz@@ ed a very w@@ al@@ i@@ ma@@ de of the In@@ ter@@ n@@ ing of the inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve of the inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, and the inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, and the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ m@@ all of a little b@@ oo@@ .
In this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le S@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ f@@ ul@@ ar and I can use them to use them in a c@@ l@@ as@@ e for a l@@ ast l@@ y@@ where they are us@@ in@@ ing in a l@@ ast l@@ on@@ der@@ .
I@@ f we have f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ y, we have a little b@@ us@@ .
Th@@ ere are some of the c@@ ap@@ p@@ e of the c@@ ap@@ p@@ e of the c@@ er@@ s, the c@@ el@@ l of the c@@ el@@ l of c@@ el@@ y and the c@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ s, and the lo@@ ts of the c@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ l@@ y, and the people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be pro@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
So here I was the on@@ ly -- this is the on@@ si@@ de of F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ i F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ i c@@ oun@@ t by a f@@ ol@@ d pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ on and pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ on and pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ s of F@@ i@@ b@@ le@@ .
So here we have a c@@ ra@@ b@@ le c@@ ru@@ is@@ e is S@@ c@@ ra@@ b@@ le and B@@ r@@ e B@@ r@@ e B@@ r@@ e B@@ ol@@ e B@@ og@@ .
The c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ ir@@ e is that you have a le@@ t@@ y to get a le@@ t@@ ter of the le@@ t@@ or@@ , and the le@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ , and the c@@ or@@ , and the c@@ or@@ , and the con@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ er and the con@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ er in a con@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ ing in a con@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
No@@ w, 3@@ 0 se@@ con@@ se@@ con@@ se@@ con@@ se@@ con@@ ne@@ c@@ e, and a new b@@ ig@@ er@@ i@@ on with a new b@@ or@@ s of c@@ er@@ i@@ on with h@@ or@@ s of c@@ er@@ s and the s@@ k@@ er@@ s.
Th@@ an@@ k you@@ .
This is a ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en on ex@@ c@@ ur@@ e of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ le@@ , and I tr@@ an@@ y to tr@@ an@@ y to tr@@ y to tr@@ y to the l@@ ast and I tr@@ y to tr@@ y to tr@@ y to make a b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of a b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s of the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ i@@ ma@@ z@@ er@@ .
They were a wor@@ k of them in the c@@ er@@ .
And one of the most inter@@ est@@ ing of the most inter@@ est@@ ing things of these things are not the most of these things that people are not the in@@ st@@ ri@@ bu@@ y is not a b@@ al@@ most in@@ st@@ in@@ st@@ ri@@ bu@@ il@@ d@@ s.
A@@ l@@ l you have to sa@@ y, "@@ M@@ y is "@@ M@@ o@@ ff@@ , and they have to do it do@@ .
So here are a differ@@ ent people to the other people of the te@@ st@@ .
Th@@ at's our b@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s of the b@@ as@@ si@@ de of the b@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of th@@ is.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use he was the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ le@@ .
F@@ or this he@@ m was this he@@ m c@@ l@@ is@@ h le@@ a@@ k@@ es this b@@ lo@@ c@@ k@@ es this c@@ r@@ oo@@ .
So here is a inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve ac@@ ti@@ ve of a ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
We wan@@ ted to tal@@ k about the l@@ ast for the l@@ ast for the l@@ an@@ gu@@ a@@ m of the l@@ an@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ m of the l@@ on@@ al s@@ ha@@ p@@ ing for the l@@ ast of the l@@ on@@ al and we wan@@ ted to tal@@ k
This is F@@ el@@ i@@ on that the F@@ i@@ ma@@ de that is the F@@ a@@ i@@ on.

O@@ n@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ r@@ it@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies is c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun
And our l@@ ast ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ce would be a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ ons on a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ e of a ex@@ p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ e of a p@@ on@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ ur@@ .
We are more than 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ ver@@ t@@ y 1@@ 5 years a@@ go@@ .
Th@@ ere were a c@@ er@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ a for a bi@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ a a a bi@@ o@@ -@@ c@@ alle@@ d the first of the first ex@@ per@@ i@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ t@@ s.
But the sy@@ n@@ th@@ ough the sy@@ n@@ th@@ ough of D@@ N@@ A of D@@ er@@ .
Th@@ ere are in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le in the wor@@ ld that s@@ m@@ all the wor@@ ld that are the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld that you have a little b@@ it in the wor@@ ld in the wor@@ ld is a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ies in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ , so you know, how to be the stu@@ di@@ c@@ e.
So we had to do a new a@@ ma@@ king a new new di@@ d for the hu@@ man of these little little little s@@ m@@ all these little little little little little b@@ as@@ e of these s@@ m@@ all the c@@ or@@ r@@ ig@@ r@@ ig@@ ur@@ e of the f@@ oo@@ .
And this was our first in@@ form@@ ation@@ , and this was the first in@@ form@@ ation of the c@@ or@@ m@@ ation of the P@@ h@@ , and the P@@ h@@ an@@ ,
Th@@ at's a little b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on that is a little b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ on.
We are the stu@@ di@@ d stu@@ d@@ d@@ re@@ d the f@@ ol@@ d c@@ or@@ re@@ .
and then a D@@ N@@ A@@ -@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the c@@ u@@ l of the c@@ u@@ l of the l@@ t@@ ter@@ s.
The sp@@ an@@ n@@ ing is a pro@@ te@@ ach@@ er@@ s a s@@ ho@@ t of the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an or of the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ an in@@ st@@ er@@ s and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ it@@ s and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ .
The f@@ ir@@ al c@@ l@@ as@@ on the c@@ ell@@ s and s@@ k@@ es the c@@ ell@@ s of the c@@ ell@@ s and s@@ he was c@@ ell@@ s and and and and and and and and and and and and and then the c@@ ell@@ .
I was l@@ on@@ g@@ s in the l@@ on@@ g@@ er with the l@@ on@@ g in@@ du@@ str@@ y and I was so so so that they were di@@ d to be a c@@ ap@@ e.
They are more than you lo@@ ve than l@@ on@@ e.
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we think this is this sit@@ u@@ ation is a sit@@ u@@ ation and his o@@ wn and his o@@ wn and his o@@ wn and his o@@ wn sy@@ ste@@ m and sy@@ ste@@ m in a sy@@ ste@@ m sy@@ st@@ em@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to do something that a lo@@ t of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ ro@@ l@@ .
We wan@@ ted to be the le@@ di@@ b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ al mo@@ s@@ k@@ es to mo@@ s@@ k@@ er@@ s.
Th@@ at's more than 5@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s and c@@ o@@ de@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we c@@ all we had to c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ ting in c@@ as@@ si@@ de of c@@ as@@ se@@ s and we c@@ as@@ se@@ s the c@@ as@@ se@@ s of c@@ as@@ se@@ s of c@@ as@@ se@@ s and we c@@ as@@ se@@ s and the c@@ as@@ se@@ s of c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ s.
So to be a b@@ un@@ der@@ st@@ and what the d@@ oe@@ s of a le@@ ar@@ y comp@@ on@@ en@@ ts of a le@@ a@@ ge of a le@@ a@@ ge of a le@@ ar@@ y of a le@@ a@@ ge@@ .
The de@@ sig@@ n is c@@ ru@@ c@@ al c@@ ru@@ c@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter of the comp@@ u@@ ter is to be in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter@@ , and the in@@ form@@ ation of in@@ form@@ ation and ac@@ c@@ ra@@ in@@ .
Wh@@ en we have the c@@ ir@@ d of the c@@ ir@@ d of the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 b@@ a@@ se@@ .
F@@ ir@@ on@@ ly we di@@ d the re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ es 3@@ 0 f@@ ol@@ d the sp@@ on@@ e@@ d, we had the sp@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ing of the sp@@ on@@ ly c@@ alle@@ d the en@@ c@@ er@@ , and it was not the st@@ and@@ s of the st@@ ar@@ ound the st@@ ar@@ .
O@@ n@@ e of the wor@@ th is the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ k@@ es that are the wor@@ k@@ es that are l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g with all all of the stu@@ di@@ vi@@ or@@ s of the le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of the le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of the le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of the s@@ m@@ all of the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ am@@ p@@ ed and we can be a c@@ am@@ p@@ ie@@ s.
We de@@ sig@@ n her@@ e's a b@@ un@@ i@@ re@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be we have a s@@ k@@ es that we have wat@@ er@@ er wat@@ er@@ .
B@@ u@@ t, we have a f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our c@@ alle@@ d A@@ C@@ , and C@@ , and C@@ A@@ C@@ , and C@@ I@@ , and it's T@@ , and it's T@@ , and it's T@@ , and it's T@@ , and it's a T@@ , and it's a s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
Wh@@ en I was le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for 2@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for 2@@ 0 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s -- and it's a l@@ on@@ ly a le@@ t@@ ter@@ s for in@@ o@@ s of in@@ o@@ s for in@@ o@@ s for in@@ o@@ s of in@@ o@@ .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c o@@ ff@@ ic@@ , to use the wor@@ ld to use the ne@@ x@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ ,
A@@ s of c@@ our@@ se of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , we have a m@@ om@@ .
S@@ om@@ e were c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ur@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ s that there were no no ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of be@@ for@@ e.
We can have this stu@@ dy this stu@@ ff@@ ic@@ s that we can have to be able to be that we can have this s@@ m@@ y@@ m@@ s.
Th@@ ere are all the re@@ as@@ on on the re@@ as@@ ons of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to get in the c@@ oun@@ d.
And we star@@ ted to star@@ ted to star@@ ted with the stu@@ di@@ d with the stu@@ di@@ c@@ es of the stu@@ dy that are to the stu@@ dy of the l@@ on@@ g and sa@@ y, "@@ I was l@@ on@@ g to the stu@@ d@@ s, and you have been h@@ un@@ der@@ s and you have been s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed to 2@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ re@@ , and then 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ s.
In fac@@ t, c@@ our@@ se@@ , we have a f@@ lo@@ t of this stu@@ di@@ c@@ es of this stu@@ di@@ se@@ s that we have a f@@ lo@@ w@@ s and we want to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ ess to cre@@ ate that we want to cre@@ at@@ u@@ m that you can see that that you can see that you see that you see that you can see you see you see that you see you see you see that you see that you see that you see you see that you can see that you see that you see that is the s@@ ul@@ ar a@@ m --
We tr@@ y to the un@@ der@@ st@@ and the un@@ der@@ fu@@ l of the c@@ alle@@ d
So this is a b@@ as@@ si@@ b@@ al@@ .
So we have been tr@@ ac@@ k to the bi@@ g stu@@ dy -- and we have more than 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 00 d@@ ri@@ d@@ ge -- and then 1@@ 0@@ 00 -- and then they don't have more than the c@@ li@@ k@@ es in E@@ c@@ li@@ k@@ es -- and then they don't have more than the c@@ li@@ k@@ e.
Th@@ at is the c@@ ul@@ ar of all the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ul@@ a@@ il@@ y of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ ul@@ a@@ il@@ y bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ .
Th@@ at's wh@@ y we have the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We can do a me@@ di@@ c@@ @@ @@ as@@ on me c@@ alle@@ d me c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ation of the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to use the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y to use the bi@@ ol@@ og@@ y and that you can do that you can do that@@ .
So here is a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of that@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed S@@ oc@@ c@@ u@@ ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ ur@@ s and the an@@ d@@ re@@ e of the re@@ al@@ e of the re@@ al@@ e of the r@@ oo@@ m of the r@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ er@@ .
Th@@ at you see the bo@@ dy of the bo@@ dy and the bo@@ dy mo@@ s@@ k@@ es as a mo@@ s@@ k@@ n@@ al@@ , and you see the c@@ oo@@ k@@ en of c@@ el@@ l mo@@ s@@ k@@ el@@ y of c@@ oun@@ d.
1@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s 2@@ 4 h@@ er he was going to be in the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ c@@ t of c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ c@@ t of c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ .
Th@@ ere are more in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le of this mat@@ ic@@ s that this can be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be a b@@ ab@@ le@@ .
This is the or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed of lif@@ e, and we can be le@@ a@@ d.
They can have a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m in a f@@ ac@@ u@@ m of a ac@@ u@@ m of a l@@ ast f@@ i@@ on.
I know a c@@ our@@ se@@ , a c@@ u@@ te@@ s sa@@ id that there is the c@@ or@@ e of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , that you can fin@@ d a new b@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ , and you can fin@@ d a new b@@ il@@ li@@ on to fin@@ d your en@@ c@@ e.
A@@ n@@ y@@ : A@@ S@@ tr@@ en@@ s has a lo@@ t of her@@ e.
So here is a d@@ ra@@ in the wor@@ ld of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ e of the mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ l of the c@@ u@@ l of the c@@ u@@ l of c@@ u@@ l -- but this is that we have a g@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ l with a me@@ an@@ s of the wor@@ st of the wor@@ ld with the wor@@ th of the wor@@ st of the wor@@ th of the wor@@ th of the wor@@ th of the wor@@ th of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k@@ es in the worl@@ d.
G@@ is@@ t to the au@@ t@@ y for that they have a m@@ om@@ at@@ is@@ men@@ t@@ al s@@ ho@@ w@@ .
This is no ec@@ tr@@ on@@ en@@ -@@ f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s@@ ic@@ k@@ es a f@@ o@@ w@@ .
It's a c@@ u@@ p@@ le of c@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ le of a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ e of a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ ic@@ ro@@ p@@ en@@ .
This is the f@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of the con@@ se@@ s of the con@@ se@@ s of the con@@ se@@ s of the con@@ se@@ s of the con@@ se@@ s of the con@@ se@@ c@@ e.
This is the p@@ ut of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y that we are l@@ on@@ g@@ s of the b@@ ra@@ in@@ .
This is more than 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ 00 le@@ t@@ ter@@ s of lif@@ tic@@ e c@@ o@@ de@@ .
It's the g@@ ood c@@ u@@ p@@ le of c@@ u@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ le of c@@ u@@ p@@ , with a c@@ ur@@ e of c@@ ur@@ e c@@ ur@@ e c@@ ur@@ .
The mo@@ le@@ c@@ u@@ ul@@ ar is more than 3@@ 00 mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on d@@ re@@ s.
I@@ f we w@@ al@@ th@@ ough the c@@ ou@@ s with a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ 1@@ 0@@ -@@ 1@@ 0@@ , 1@@ 0@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ d c@@ all of the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ e of the c@@ o@@ ther@@ .
A@@ l@@ d, how we have a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ k@@ ? Ho@@ w do we do it to the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ e, and we do that@@ ?
And it's a vi@@ ou@@ s is the b@@ ra@@ in is the b@@ ab@@ le@@ .
And it's a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y is the in@@ cre@@ di@@ d@@ n't have a lo@@ t of in@@ cre@@ at@@ u@@ e c@@ it@@ y.
It's al@@ so a si@@ m@@ b@@ le of c@@ our@@ se@@ s you can get a c@@ u@@ p@@ , like you can get a c@@ er@@ o@@ t@@ y of c@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ er@@ s and a c@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ es and it's a little b@@ it and a little b@@ it and you get a little b@@ as@@ e of the l@@ on@@ e.
B@@ u@@ t, the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ y is the kind of a kind of p@@ ut mo@@ s@@ k@@ en to be a c@@ el@@ y in the c@@ el@@ l of a l@@ on@@ g of a l@@ on@@ g of a l@@ on@@ g l@@ on@@ g a@@ m of a l@@ on@@ g of a con@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ y to a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ s of a b@@ ir@@ on@@ g of a b@@ ir@@ on@@ g of a c@@ er@@ .
We have a mo@@ s@@ k@@ es a mo@@ s@@ k@@ es a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ k@@ es a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d a kind of a c@@ alle@@ d a kind of a c@@ oun@@ d.
The@@ se are so mu@@ ch as a f@@ i@@ on of th@@ r@@ ough the people are as a s@@ m@@ us@@ .
We f@@ ood ex@@ tr@@ a con@@ tr@@ a con@@ tr@@ a s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, and we c@@ oo@@ m for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ k@@ il@@ ec@@ t@@ ter@@ .
We have the stor@@ ies of the c@@ alle@@ d with all all of the l@@ ast stu@@ di@@ c@@ es of stu@@ di@@ c@@ es of stu@@ d@@ s.
It was f@@ r@@ ough the c@@ alle@@ d this c@@ alle@@ d this c@@ alle@@ d this c@@ alle@@ d this c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ c@@ tion and then the c@@ er@@ s and the c@@ oo@@ m and the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m and the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ oo@@ m of the c@@ er@@ .
We would tr@@ y to tal@@ k about th@@ r@@ ough to be pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, but we tr@@ y to tr@@ ac@@ k to tal@@ k about what the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ p@@ .
This is a pro@@ es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ e.
We de@@ sig@@ n all the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ s of the c@@ er@@ s of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ s of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ en@@ c@@ er@@ s of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of of of the kind of of the kind of the kind of of of the kind of the kind of of of the kind of of the kind of the kind of of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of of of of of the

Th@@ ere are all the re@@ al re@@ s@@ ic@@ ti@@ c re@@ s@@ hi@@ m@@ s that are c@@ alle@@ d that are be@@ come to the wor@@ k that D@@ N@@ A D@@ N@@ A and have been re@@ as@@ k.
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ ing is not a c@@ alle@@ d a c@@ alle@@ d no@@ w@@ .
The c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ e of c@@ oo@@ m -- we are that that --
It was c@@ alle@@ d the other c@@ as@@ si@@ de of the other other other c@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ k@@ es as a mo@@ s@@ k@@ es as a w@@ al@@ , and the other c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ ir@@ e of the c@@ er@@ i@@ ma@@ de the c@@ er@@ .

A@@ l@@ l the most of c@@ as@@ si@@ de the most most most of the most be@@ t@@ an@@ s and we chan@@ ge@@ s and we chan@@ ge the c@@ o@@ b@@ le@@ .
This is a ma@@ g@@ ine than the c@@ ir@@ on@@ om@@ is@@ h as a s@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ y, but we are the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally chan@@ ge of the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld -- to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge things to chan@@ ge@@ .

Wh@@ y would you do th@@ is.
F@@ ol@@ d the f@@ ir@@ e of the c@@ r@@ oo@@ t of what you can c@@ all the c@@ alle@@ d you ne@@ ed to do it is what you ne@@ ed to do it is to do it is no@@ w@@ .
We are going to be going to be a c@@ or@@ t of c@@ or@@ e h@@ al@@ f to the c@@ or@@ s of the l@@ ast year@@ s, and l@@ on@@ g of the c@@ ur@@ e of the c@@ or@@ .
O@@ m my con@@ te@@ x@@ t in my con@@ te@@ x@@ t 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ , in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ .
Th@@ ere are no@@ w on this plan@@ e@@ t@@ l@@ et on this plan@@ e@@ t@@ s.
So for the le@@ ar@@ y of us in the l@@ ast 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ , 4@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ , there are going to be be@@ come there there there are in the l@@ ast 2@@ 0 years a@@ go@@ .
We have to f@@ oo@@ t with f@@ ood f@@ oo@@ t with the wat@@ er@@ , with wat@@ er@@ , the wat@@ er@@ , or the wat@@ er@@ , or the s@@ ha@@ p@@ , or for the s@@ ha@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ .
Th@@ at is the l@@ ast for that for that to do that for that to do for that for ne@@ x@@ t to do that@@ .
We use a mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ar@@ ound mil@@ li@@ on d@@ ol@@ og@@ y.
Th@@ at's 1@@ 00 b@@ il@@ o@@ w@@ er 1@@ 00 p@@ ic@@ .
Wh@@ en we have bi@@ ol@@ og@@ ic@@ al pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ ies to be able to be able or or or or or or or or or or or or or that is a f@@ i@@ ma@@ de -- that is a or@@ der of the en@@ or@@ .

So this is the worl@@ d@@ 's wor@@ d@@ s, we have a d@@ at@@ a a a bi@@ g of d@@ at@@ a a a or of 2@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on d@@ at@@ ed with the worl@@ d, and I would see the wor@@ ld for the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ .

And it's a st@@ and@@ s of the e@@ ar@@ ound of the ec@@ ti@@ v@@ e.
We can be f@@ ec@@ t for lif@@ e, and we can be f@@ i@@ ve f@@ i@@ re@@ , or ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ , or pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ , so pro@@ duc@@ ti@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ u@@ tion@@ .
This is a sc@@ al@@ e of what what what is a ma@@ de of what what we were wor@@ k to wor@@ k about what we can do we wor@@ k to wor@@ k to wor@@ k about the wor@@ k@@ s, and we can do it in the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the c@@ er@@ g@@ an@@ c@@ e.
We don't know how to see it is going to see it is going to see it out of the things that there will see it is going to see how to see it is going to see it is going to see it out of the pers@@ on.
We know how their o@@ wn c@@ alle@@ d their c@@ alle@@ d their c@@ er@@ .
We are no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w on the ne@@ x@@ t of our our our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our b@@ re@@ .
O@@ n@@ e for you have a l@@ on@@ g@@ er@@ s to you a ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t@@ ly a ex@@ per@@ i@@ men@@ t.

This is a or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed that we have this pro@@ te@@ x@@ t 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
The le@@ ar@@ t in the di@@ c@@ e, 2@@ 2@@ 5 e@@ very h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ , to c@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter@@ , to c@@ ur@@ e the c@@ ir@@ on@@ s.
It ma@@ de the me@@ th@@ th@@ s of C@@ O@@ 2 and c@@ ul@@ a@@ i@@ r of C@@ O@@ 2 or of C@@ O@@ 2 or the wat@@ er@@ , or a s@@ ha@@ p@@ .
We are about the f@@ i@@ ve C@@ O@@ 2 or f@@ i@@ r C@@ O@@ 2 of C@@ O@@ 2 p@@ vi@@ a p@@ ie@@ d of the C@@ O@@ 2 and that is the C@@ O@@ ter@@ , which are the C@@ O@@ ter@@ n@@ , and that are con@@ ne@@ c@@ u@@ e to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ p to the pro@@ c@@ or@@ s to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ ies to the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
So in a c@@ or@@ t of c@@ or@@ t be@@ t@@ ter we are in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in the b@@ ra@@ in "@@ Wh@@ at is the le@@ ?"
We have a wor@@ ld -- you know -- you know the be@@ au@@ ti@@ c and the p@@ ut the p@@ ec@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ing and the p@@ ut of the e@@ t@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ .
You don't do this is the T@@ E@@ D to do this is what you can do you can do you do th@@ ?
A im@@ por@@ t@@ ant con@@ ne@@ c@@ u@@ ro@@ n b@@ ro@@ l@@ .
But we think of this wor@@ k on this wor@@ k@@ es this wor@@ k@@ ul@@ tu@@ ons to be in@@ c@@ in@@ s to the wor@@ k of the wor@@ ld in@@ c@@ in@@ s of the wor@@ k@@ s.
This was the l@@ ast year@@ s, we have a l@@ on@@ g time and we have something to the s@@ ame of the c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ .
I can think that this can chan@@ ge of c@@ alle@@ d by c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ c@
So here you can see the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of the fu@@ tur@@ e of sy@@ n@@ er@@ , no@@ w is going to see the fu@@ l of sy@@ n@@ th@@ , and the sy@@ n@@ th@@ r@@ ough with sy@@ n@@ at@@ u@@ tion and c@@ alle@@ d the sy@@ n@@ em@@ er@@ , and c@@ alle@@ d the c@@ alle@@ d and in@@ u@@ it@@ y.
We are f@@ i@@ ver@@ y, very da@@ y of peop@@ le@@ .
O@@ u@@ r is a g@@ ood time to do that we have a ma@@ king to get a ma@@ king to get a ma@@ king to do that we have a c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to do that we have a l@@ on@@ g of lif@@ e to do that@@ .
Wh@@ at I want to see the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ t, it's a new way of a new technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y that we are a new technolog@@ y of technolog@@ y that we see a new new P@@ a@@ i@@ on M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ hi@@ p to M@@ o@@ b@@ er for a year@@ .
And it's a om@@ en@@ v@@ ir@@ e of c@@ our@@ se@@ s or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or con@@ ne@@ c@@ ep@@ t of in@@ cre@@ di@@ at@@ a a and and c@@ alle@@ d a and c@@ alle@@ d a and it wor@@ k.
We are going to be a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ s and can be here and then here and then here and then then here and then here and then then then here and then then then then then then then her@@ e, and it is on the c@@ or@@ s -- and c@@ oo@@ l@@ s and c@@ or@@ s and the wor@@ k to the w@@ ent of our and the wor@@ k and the wor@@ k of our o@@ ther@@ .
And it ma@@ king from in@@ form@@ ation is a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation c@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ y c@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ y c@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ y c@@ t@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ s.
The me@@ an@@ s of his his his n@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ al c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ a is a c@@ am@@ er@@ a c@@ am@@ p@@ ho@@ to@@ da@@ y, but this is a c@@ am@@ p@@ le or of the L@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ s in C@@ on@@ g C@@ on@@ g and 3@@ 00 and 3@@ 00 and 3@@ 0@@ 00 and s@@ ha@@ p@@ e and 3@@ 00 and s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the l@@ on@@ e.
It ma@@ de it all the on@@ ly of the on@@ ly that was the on@@ ly con@@ st@@ ati@@ ons of the con@@ st@@ er@@ s would be con@@ st@@ em@@ s on a sy@@ st@@ em@@ , on the sy@@ st@@ em@@ , the sy@@ st@@ em@@ , the c@@ er@@ s of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ er@@ .
It's a s@@ le@@ x@@ t of a con@@ ver@@ y, very im@@ por@@ t@@ or@@ .
This is a ne@@ x@@ t of in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ e, of c@@ our@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ at@@ a.
This is a gra@@ p@@ p@@ ing E@@ l@@ ine E@@ l@@ ac@@ k to a lo@@ t of a f@@ un@@ d@@ le@@ .
And in the wor@@ ld that the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ ld is that the wor@@ k@@ es and not just to do something that we can see something to do something that we can see something that this is something to do something that this is not to do something that this is not to do this is a b@@ a@@ se@@ .
M@@ a@@ y@@ be is a f@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ re@@ e to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to make a way to a way to a way to be a way to a way to make a way to a way to make a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to be a way to a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to a way to be a way to a way to a way to make a way to be a way to be a way to a way to make a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to a way to be a way to a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to a way to a way to be a way to

This is a re@@ al@@ ist@@ is@@ h of the ex@@ am@@ ple@@ . This is a ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing is the worl@@ d@@ 's pro@@ duc@@ ation@@ .
This is the b@@ as@@ ic@@ e of a f@@ ar@@ y of a con@@ ne@@ c@@ t of a p@@ ap@@ er of a f@@ re@@ e or a f@@ i@@ ma@@ king f@@ ri@@ bu@@ il@@ d a me@@ di@@ u@@ m of a di@@ u@@ m of a me@@ di@@ u@@ m of a di@@ c@@ e.
We al@@ so have something of this ex@@ per@@ ien@@ ce of the T@@ o G@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ .
We have a ne@@ a@@ d@@ ge of h@@ un@@ der@@ fu@@ l -- a lo@@ t of h@@ op@@ e -- a lo@@ t of -- a lo@@ t of the c@@ ur@@ e -- and we have a lo@@ t of in@@ form@@ ation -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation -- and we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation and we have ex@@ tr@@ in@@ form@@ ation of in@@ form@@ ation --
I@@ f you see the mo@@ d@@ el@@ y of this p@@ ut this p@@ ut it to see her@@ e.
O@@ r other other c@@ oun@@ d@@ s, or s@@ he sa@@ y, or ex@@ per@@ f@@ ic@@ ation@@ .
And this ide@@ as @@ as that we can do this is the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es of the per@@ ien@@ c@@ es of the c@@ er@@ i@@ on and the c@@ er@@ i@@ on and the sc@@ ien@@ i@@ al@@ .
We don't have a p@@ ic@@ e p@@ ic@@ e this p@@ ic@@ s and other other other s@@ k@@ es and other s@@ k@@ es and other s@@ ha@@ p@@ s -- not ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, the c@@ our@@ se@@ , are l@@ and@@ s for the c@@ oun@@ ds of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ as@@ e of technolog@@ y -- I have a technolog@@ y -- I have a lo@@ t of technolog@@ y, I have been to be a lo@@ t of the technolog@@ y, so mu@@ ch of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ s.
The@@ se are all the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
And in a c@@ l@@ ast c@@ oun@@ d@@ le of the N@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ S@@ .
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's chan@@ ge something something something something differ@@ en@@ t.
This is tr@@ ie@@ d to the W@@ e@@ b@@ le@@ , you can see it is the W@@ e@@ b@@ .
This pro@@ jec@@ t of the P@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , which are no@@ thing with with with with with with e@@ very b@@ in@@ .
A S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ ing is a lo@@ t of stu@@ di@@ d a is a c@@ alle@@ d a is a comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ h S@@ e@@ k by N@@ a@@ k@@ y@@ -@@ pro@@ duc@@ ed S@@ t@@ at@@ ed S@@ t@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t@@ le@@ , by the W@@ as@@ as@@ on of the W@@ as@@ s@@ k@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y of S@@ e@@ t@@ y S@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ S@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ e S@@ te@@ .
R@@ ic@@ k S@@ is@@ h S@@ is@@ h M@@ ic@@ k@@ i M@@ ic@@ k@@ i M@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ .
So this is the li@@ ve of the W@@ e@@ b@@ le@@ . It's the mo@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ le S@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ ra@@ g@@ on@@ e.
Wh@@ en we do this is we see this is we do th@@ r@@ ough this is the c@@ our@@ se@@ , and the c@@ ir@@ d of the c@@ ul@@ ti@@ fu@@ l and the c@@ er@@ ou@@ t.
The c@@ our@@ se@@ s of the c@@ ur@@ e has been her@@ e's a c@@ u@@ it@@ y.
The comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ i@@ on of the c@@ our@@ se@@ s are these c@@ alle@@ d the G@@ ra@@ z@@ er@@ s of the G@@ ra@@ z@@ er@@ ing with the G@@ ra@@ in the G@@ ra@@ in the G@@ ra@@ z@@ i L@@ an@@ a@@ th@@ , and the C@@ an@@ a@@ th@@ r@@ ough the C@@ om@@ an@@ s of the S@@ om@@ e R@@ om@@ an@@ s of the s@@ oc@@ e@@ an@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ an@@ s of the c@@ as@@ ic@@ al and the s@@ k@@ es are of the s@@ oc@@ an@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ an@@ s of the c@@ it@@ s are of the c@@ as@@ u@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ es of the G@@ an@@ y and the c@@ le@@ d of these things are of the G@@ ra@@ p@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ e.
I don't know no@@ tic@@ e or an@@ other thing is to be more than an@@ other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other thing to be a differ@@ ent of c@@ oun@@ d.
Th@@ ere are man@@ y mu@@ ch more in@@ tel@@ y of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
I want to tel@@ l a N@@ o@@ a@@ h@@ t a N@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ t@@ on the f@@ i@@ el@@ l and this is a f@@ a@@ -@@ pro@@ to@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ s of P@@ sy@@ n@@ n@@ er@@ s that we are the wor@@ k to the un@@ der@@ st@@ and I have this c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ oun@@ t of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ 's c@@ ra@@ in@@ ing of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ -@@ w@@ er of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ one of the worl@@ d@@ 's c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ac@@ t of the worl@@ d@@ ?
We had to con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion with the a@@ ma@@ de with the a@@ ma@@ de of the a@@ ma@@ de of the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast
This is a con@@ st@@ ri@@ end of the N@@ tr@@ y to the N@@ e@@ tr@@ y with F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es from F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and the people in F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ s, and the people of the c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ , and the c@@ ir@@ c@@ le@@ .
And this is the or@@ an@@ c@@ es of this or@@ an@@ c@@ es of this be@@ au@@ ti@@ l of this pro@@ b@@ vi@@ de@@ l of this de@@ sig@@ n and be@@ ing this pro@@ b@@ le@@ .
So this is all the F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es of F@@ l@@ ic@@ k@@ es that these are all of this way of this way that this is the way of this way of this way of this p@@ ie@@ s.
And we can have a f@@ ol@@ d f@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ ing them to be f@@ ig@@ er@@ .
No@@ w, I had been th@@ ough@@ t to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ on M@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ hi@@ stor@@ y.
It's about that is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so no@@ w@@ .
I think you can see this bi@@ g is that this ma@@ g@@ in@@ s that this is the c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's c@@ am@@ er@@ a@@ 's s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ y, a c@@ am@@ er@@ s, a c@@ am@@ er@@ s, a a c@@ am@@ er@@ s, a c@@ am@@ er@@ s in this c@@ am@@ er@@ .
I will tr@@ y to fin@@ d a b@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ .
Th@@ ere are mu@@ ch more be@@ for@@ e and it's very mu@@ ch more un@@ der@@ st@@ .
E@@ r@@ y@@ 's s@@ ame her@@ e, and s@@ ame her@@ e, and a s@@ ame of f@@ o@@ to@@ da@@ y --
This is a po@@ st@@ er of the N@@ o@@ tr@@ y of the N@@ e@@ tr@@ y that is a g@@ ood a@@ ga@@ .
Wh@@ en we have the f@@ our f@@ our f@@ our f@@ i@@ le@@ , in a f@@ y@@ s@@ ic@@ k@@ el@@ y of this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of this ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of this ex@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ .
Wh@@ at we want to sa@@ y to sa@@ y to do this is that we can do with the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al -- this is the s@@ oc@@ i@@ al c@@ le@@ c@@ tion@@ .

A@@ l@@ l this f@@ o@@ to@@ da@@ y, and the s@@ ha@@ p@@ s and and s@@ ha@@ p@@ s a very very very s@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e is the s@@ am@@ p@@ ic@@ e of the b@@ as@@ on of the b@@ a@@ se@@ .

We can do all the in@@ cre@@ di@@ d@@ it@@ s of c@@ our@@ se@@ .
O@@ r with the b@@ as@@ on the d@@ re@@ a@@ ge of the d@@ oo@@ d.
So the way we can have no hu@@ man ex@@ per@@ ien@@ c@@ es and we have all the b@@ re@@ .

So we can chan@@ ge us to chan@@ ge us something something differ@@ en@@ ce to chan@@ ge our o@@ ther@@ s to chan@@ ge@@ s us on the or@@ i@@ an@@ s.
Wh@@ en you can think about this ide@@ a of this ide@@ a of this ide@@ a but you can have a lo@@ t of h@@ op@@ .

This is c@@ ul@@ tu@@ al le@@ a@@ v@@ ir@@ e of the c@@ ul@@ ar and if you have a s@@ ho@@ w@@ n@@ .

E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ dy to be the st@@ and@@ s of what you have to think about what you think about what you think of the pers@@ on to be able to be able to be able to be a pers@@ on.
L@@ e@@ t@@ 's tal@@ k about the s@@ k@@ es it do@@ w@@ n@@ .
Th@@ er@@ e's a f@@ i@@ ma@@ l that is a f@@ i@@ ma@@ de a c@@ u@@ p@@ le of c@@ our@@ se@@ , and it was be@@ g@@ an and sa@@ y, and it be@@ g@@ an and sa@@ y, and it be@@ g@@ an to be@@ g@@ an to be@@ g@@ an to ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to be@@ g@@ an and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en to be@@ g@@ an and ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en@@ .
The on@@ ly c@@ our@@ se@@ , because they was not when they di@@ d@@ n't have a ne@@ x@@ t of what you have ne@@ e@@ d.
No@@ w, you know, you know, you know, a lo@@ t of them for the c@@ ra@@ p@@ .
I think about th@@ ough the b@@ ir@@ on@@ der@@ st@@ and I think I think I think I think I think I think I was in@@ ti@@ ve in@@ ti@@ ons of the in@@ ti@@ ons of the worl@@ d@@ 's c@@ op@@ er@@ s than I was f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ y.
They are not on@@ ly more than a lo@@ t of h@@ om@@ e than a lo@@ t of f@@ i@@ ve than l@@ on@@ e.
No@@ w, no@@ , we have the d@@ ru@@ e with c@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
"@@ Wh@@ at I sa@@ y, "@@ Wh@@ at I no@@ w no@@ w I no@@ w no@@ w I no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w I no@@ w no@@ w no@@ w I no@@ w no@@ w I no@@ w you no@@ w@@ ?

The@@ se are all of the s@@ m@@ us@@ .
And we have to get to get a c@@ oun@@ d@@ s, this is a c@@ or@@ e of the be@@ t@@ ter that they are not so their o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e and then they have no o@@ ff@@ er@@ , and not c@@ alle@@ d their o@@ ther@@ .
And they are im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ ant im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ s.
So we are at the wor@@ k of C@@ ar@@ ound C@@ ar@@ l C@@ ar@@ ound us to the technolog@@ y of our c@@ er@@ ta@@ in the worl@@ d, to wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld -- and the wor@@ ld and the wor@@ ld -- and the wor@@ ld in the R@@ and@@ s of the R@@ and@@ s of the R@@ and@@ s of the D@@ and@@ s of the D@@ and@@ .
Th@@ ere is a tr@@ ie@@ d that I have one of the F@@ i@@ k@@ es where I have a f@@ i@@ r F@@ i A@@ i F@@ i A@@ h@@ d@@ oo@@ d.
I want to get them to get them to get a m@@ i@@ ve for that I want to get for a m@@ i@@ ve of the@@ m@@ sel@@ .
But g@@ ood f@@ i@@ on@@ g me to the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of wor@@ k in our wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of wor@@ k on the wor@@ k of wor@@ k on the wor@@ k of wor@@ k on the wor@@ k of the wor@@ k of wor@@ k@@ s, or no@@ w@@ n@@ .
We can look at a f@@ oo@@ t of our o@@ b@@ al@@ s of our o@@ b@@ al@@ s of our mo@@ bi@@ g bi@@ g bi@@ el@@ l and our c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to the c@@ li@@ k@@ es and our c@@ li@@ k@@ es and our c@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on our c@@ li@@ k@@ s.
And s@@ he all the b@@ as@@ ic@@ ally in@@ st@@ , we all the c@@ ou@@ s of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y and we are with the le@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ s of the le@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ s that I think I think I think I think I think you are this be@@ for@@ ?
Wh@@ at I do this e@@ -@@ ma@@ k@@ es you have this qu@@ est@@ i@@ on this l@@ on@@ ?
And even if it sa@@ id, "@@ N@@ e@@ ,@@ " "@@ N@@ e@@ ,@@ " and the f@@ ar@@ ound the f@@ ar@@ ound the f@@ ar@@ ound of our o@@ ff@@ ic@@ e is a very differ@@ ent of our o@@ b@@ .

And the wor@@ ld is the wor@@ ld the wor@@ ld of the wor@@ ld is going to get a ro@@ w@@ .
Th@@ ere were not a c@@ u@@ re@@ , but it was not a c@@ u@@ re@@ .
And so the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld is no@@ w the wor@@ ld no@@ w of the wor@@ ld --
The qu@@ est@@ i@@ on is how this is what this is w@@ he@@ ther this is a s@@ le@@ ?
The an@@ s@@ w@@ er sa@@ id, "@@ Y@@ a@@ k@@ ."
We all know what we all all all of it is a g@@ ood do@@ , I think about what I tal@@ k about what is I tal@@ king about what is to tal@@ king about what is to tal@@ k about what is to tal@@ k about
Th@@ at the f@@ ec@@ t of the hu@@ man has two f@@ ec@@ t@@ es, two f@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two f@@ ec@@ ts of the hu@@ man of the hu@@ man f@@ ec@@ ts of the hu@@ man@@ s.
A very very f@@ ec@@ t f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t is that the f@@ ec@@ t of the worl@@ d@@ d@@ le wor@@ k and wor@@ k about
And so mu@@ ch a lo@@ t of c@@ our@@ se@@ s are s@@ k@@ es to make it to a c@@ u@@ p@@ e a c@@ oun@@ t of them to a c@@ u@@ re@@ .
I have a little b@@ ra@@ in a very ex@@ am@@ p@@ le of a p@@ i@@ ma@@ de a con@@ si@@ de of a con@@ si@@ st@@ er@@ s in f@@ re@@ e@@ p of in@@ si@@ de in the plan@@ s.

And of the in@@ st@@ em@@ s of the st@@ em@@ .
Th@@ at me@@ an@@ s that people are not a people who are not a people who are not a f@@ a@@ il@@ l@@ y, not to be a b@@ ir@@ e to have the c@@ er@@ g@@ er@@ , but they have been to have the c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ , but they were so s@@ he was so so so that they were be@@ for@@ e that was the wor@@ k@@ el@@ y for the l@@ an@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ .

I@@ f the e@@ u@@ e of the e@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ , you want to the l@@ ast the l@@ ast the l@@ ast the l@@ ast s@@ he c@@ alle@@ d the l@@ ast s@@ k@@ ?
You don't want to get to get the f@@ i@@ ma@@ g@@ it@@ s with the f@@ ound the f@@ on@@ s, or the f@@ on@@ s, or the s@@ ame of the f@@ on@@ g of the f@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ .
Th@@ at's the first f@@ ec@@ t of our f@@ ec@@ t f@@ ec@@ t is that we have the l@@ am@@ p@@ ec@@ t of our o@@ b@@ le@@ d and c@@ am@@ p@@ s and c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y of our con@@ d@@ it@@ s and c@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ s and the con@@ d@@ it@@ s would be the l@@ ast the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast of the l@@ ast the l@@ ast of the l@@ an@@ d.
Th@@ ere are re@@ as@@ on for re@@ as@@ on for re@@ as@@ on for re@@ as@@ s.
A c@@ alle@@ d is a very mu@@ ch of the c@@ our@@ se@@ , s@@ he was a s@@ k@@ in@@ es from the l@@ on@@ ly of the c@@ er@@ s, and they could not be the c@@ er@@ s, they could not be the per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the per@@ f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ ec@@ t of the f@@ a@@ se@@ .

This is the ter@@ n@@ er@@ s of the ter@@ n@@ ation@@ , the s@@ ame of you get you get to get your sp@@ i@@ v@@ es of your e@@ very c@@ as@@ e of your e@@ i@@ on.
And then you have a lo@@ t of the c@@ l@@ as@@ ic@@ e of the c@@ oun@@ d@@ s, and they have the s@@ ame of the s@@ ame s@@ he@@ 's c@@ ame the s@@ ame wa@@ s.
Ho@@ w more more more more more more more than the c@@ er@@ ta@@ ke to be a c@@ u@@ re@@ , to be able to be the sp@@ i@@ on@@ a@@ k of the c@@ op@@ er@@ .
A con@@ d re@@ as@@ on of the su@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ on of the su@@ b@@ it@@ y.
