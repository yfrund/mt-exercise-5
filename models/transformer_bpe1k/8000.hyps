Forig years, I see this two dia's shows to skap, which the police of the last three million years of the faster was about the faster of the faster of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem of this specific problem because it didn't the any problem because it diction.
The ice cooling on the North pool is in the clason the climate system.
It looks in the winter and comps in the side of the side
The next dia that I shows a put of what the last 25 years is a 25 years of what happened in 25 years is a 25 years of what happening.
The permanence is clearning in rood.
As you see it from the dark batch the sker barkerbage.
That's the year is the equires at the winter.
And the crips in the simply in the simer.
The same thing that called a five years or parently or parently like blood is almost like blood and the body.
In 25 years is the same of this is the same thing.
And that's a problem because the bigh fres around the North close of the North IJust have a very great her there there were a very great high fres in the microam of cools in meth.
Fore age of the total high of courity in the atmosphere, which would be faize how we can put it to the eatmosphere.
In some ondiple indiple in Alaska borreligion of the water.
After ter winter winter was Professor Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska different to a different to a different from Alaska differently under.
Whoo! Well, it's OK. The question is real or we will be able to be ad.
A reason is that this enormous were breaon" Groenls of the normous were from the normous were country.
This is a smell smely smely of smel.
The water than ever is real than ever ful.
This is the Kangerlusual suast-Groengineer-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea sequence because it country because it's the lands of the sea place where the place in the sea cure where the sea cure in the sea cure where the sean in.
These stroms need to take it.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South pool, invents the biggest ice mass the biggest ice mass the earth.
And African entire scientists scientists that the whole continent now is now a negative imagative imagative equation.
More specific is the ice of the South pool of the South pole of the South pool of the same times of the same particults, with some water elects.
The whole continent state for six meter, like Groence, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the Himalaya, the two nice massay, there are now new years ago, who were now years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the whole of his drive water of that smell time.
In the Andes, this glast the brow of dink water for this city.
There are now more stromes.
But when they win, they also win, it also it trips the dink water.
In California was a fires of 40 percent in the snow pack of the Sierra.
It really comes in the water reservice in the water reservice.
And like you couldn't experiences are the predictions
This world's world as a dreamed dreams of a dramatical stians.
And the number of nature, the number of the world's world is never seen a incredible and never seen the world.
Fither ther than in the last 30 years in the past 75 years.
This pattern is followed involved
If you look at the point of a historic context than you can see what happening.
In the last money five years we have 70 million ton on on CO2 hours of course.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, Kook to the eye area to the eye area of the Stille Ocean each other, and then there is a drags of the Indian inent, there is a drags of stribuilding, there is a dragins.
The only great bigh of the Earth, name, name for 20 percent of the Earth, which is the burn of phospits of phosps of phossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and stead is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest stoters, samps with China.
And there was a still of more still of more still centrals.
But we see a moment.
These are the cities of the bold cools that was annuled in the last year in the last year and where larges are alternative alternative are alternative in the last year cool.
There is real political stribuilt on the gang in our country.
The cities, and oil indust-indust-industy gave 250 million dollars of dollars of a son," which is a text of promots, which is a testing business.
And that picture to something like this.
Rond the number was four home in Tennesse, about four billion billion billion billion of money.
You have the probably in the new news in the new news in the new news.
This is the only one na largest of falstrict in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adverties of the cool left on the Kerst was deside the Kerst was deside was deside the Kerst was deside of the cool.
Video: "Frosty the coolman is a blice, oppossible of cool.
He is fluence in America, and he he's sorgs in America, and he was flow.
Frosty the coolman becomes with the day of the day.
He is means and working and working and working and work."
Here's a big part of the cool part of the cool in West Virginia of of of of the cool of the city.
The biggest mber working biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguage here, "Let me be clearn. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, Harry Red, Harry Red,
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Kliance for Klimate two campapaign.
This is a piece of a little bit of a wor.
Fideo "By COALergy, we see the climate changes as a serious of confire.
That's the reason why it's important to the most important to the gigantly is to recognizing to the light of the light of the truth of the truth of truth of the truth of the truth of cool.
Feity, stone, is not song.
We find that it's sonly a song -- and it's still a lock eye.
So, you don't have changed not about climate change.
Let me be able to us.
Video: Acure cool, you have a lot of about heard a lot of about heard here.
So let's look at this hypermodern in this hypermodern cool.
Fantastic stic! The machines are what law.
But that's the sound of sound sound technology.
And thanks the fact that the fact that the burning of cities, one of the most importance of the fact of the Earth, change the policishing of the Earth is actually the rite of the fact that you see here.
Look a good around this is the scale technology of today.
Al Gore: Einture, the positive alternative alternative in our economic challenges and that are increated on the building.
Video: Stem: America verage in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national secrisis.
The red red red red is our dependent of phospity, is our fields, like fiels like fires and inmporteers and inmported oil.
But now there is a durbing flow solution to get here,
Fore America of 100 percent of 100 percent of each country in 10 years.
A plan America to get America to get the work of the work of us fiels and the opportunates of the Earth general warming called the general warming of the Earth.
Eintually a solution that enough enough, is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Ontded high.
Al Gore: And the last latst.
Video: Stem: It's going to give America to give America
A of the snelst ways to make a end of the eind of our old any of old old any of old the planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Neous 2: New we investments.
Stem: Repower America. Tion to be realistic to be realist.
Al Gore: There is a old African playing that says, "If you want to be a set of course.
If you want to go away to say, "If you want to file."
We need to far away and fast.
Thank you very much.
Forig year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back to a put about how that machine machine about how machine machine works.
So I'm now, I did not have been found the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment in scientific experiment in 27 miment in the miment of science.
It need to need to need the stances that are along than a billion than a billion second naion to 100 million to 100 million time.
Enorm ambition!
This is the machine under Gen's faile.
We need photographs of those mini-Big Big Bangs in detectors and this is detectors the ATLAStor -- 44 meter -- 44 meter.
Spectacular pectacular photographer in in the scale.
And in 10 september shape years, we have the machine for the first one.
This photographed was genomes by ATLAS.
That the factory for a factory in the controllly.
It's a photography of the first particle that help around the LHC gone around the LHC gone with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, in the detector of the tector of the first particles of the first particles of the first parttly deal with a picture of the first of the first party of the first particults.
In other words, when we photographs on 10 September win, we were fires that the machine works, which is a huge win.
I don't know if this the largest of this biggest of the biggest of the Google and then somebody went to Google and saw the internets.
That means we have a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had a problem with this gold went with this gold thing.
That draw agos 13 thousand put the machine on the full machine on volution.
The engineers are going to say, "No true. It's a little draw.
They can do because they do superidence they are on help on help on help on help on help on help on help on whole ly.
So on min 271 grads, they can be the globs, can the girls, that can be able to be able to the strongs.
In a picture of the next between the next magnets in the LHC, sat a construction.
That was the wirelectrical wear, and was there inside electrical weaks that 13 thousands of thousands of amp.
This was the results.
This is another indrugs like you realized that magneed to be more than 20 ton again, and they were about 30 centimeter than 20 centimeter working about 30 centimes in the world
We protected about 50 magnets.
We had to get them from half, what we did do.
We all have been found them.
Now they are back them.
Eind might be the LHC weagain.
We will go to him and we expect and we expect to measing him or young or you're going to be able to the outside of the universe,
Now, of course, who have been incredibate the debate of scientific across the value of scientific research. It's making easy research of science.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so much more than ever than ever going to be able than ever the LHC.
I leave the last words on the last scientists scientist, I was designer Humphysical age of the value of his learning experiments of his learning Michael Faraday, this is so much Faray Faray Faray Faraich, and then we are not have the human being in counterms of the last ast found the core of the compassions, and the counter."
Thank you.
I would start to ask with you to ask to you to go to your children to go to your children you play with block with blocks.
When you do do how to go to the fire, they had to understand and and picture, was actually problems of the long problems of space with the line relations of space with the space relations.
Rutell you that invision is strong because of the world to understand of the world
If a information of informed by the name of physical interaction with objects -- samps with my advision -- sample of my advision -- what I started to ask me -- what we started to ask me -- what if we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer music, in a musical follower of musical fingingingle moves that we can information with a little bit with a little bit of front of faireauts.
and can be able to orders like we want to orders like we want to orders like we want to orders like we want?
This question this question of us so we decided to slower a answer of Siftables.
Cort samental is a Siftly interactive computer ter ter ter ter ter ter than a cooks.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to put them to each other, their movement and they free a screen and they free a screen and contact.
The nuclear is the physical handled is the physical hand-blocks they get to understand in the understand there.
Bovenes are Siftables a pully, of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
That this hold a more physical physical difference of them, and even of their movement of their movement, and even of the way we have been different new way we have different new leave new learn and even interactions of interactions of the move.
I'll start with some of some simple example example example of the simple example of a simple example of simple example example example of the simple example example of the simple example example example example example of the simple example of the sible example example of the sings.
This Sifty is instimage to tell a video to sot a certain by cancerating and others others and others others and others other.
These interactive portraves are of each other.
Indis are nast, they will put it for each other.
If they were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a singup.
Forder they feel and they moved them and helling.
We realized algave that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction, the use of the interaction, as it used from the interaction, like a little flating of a flater as a flying as it was a flying flat.
In this example of the example Siftables of the piece of the small of a leg in a leg in a leg in a leg in a leg in a leg in a leg in a lege of she said where they are being them in a leg in a leg in a leave in this picture and I can use them in this rights.
If we have been dreven, we have a little bit back to what back.
There are some corned possibility for the education, which is a lot of play with tool, which we can be able to the possibility and logics of things that we want to be able to see things that we are the results of the results of the possible of the basically result of the culat.
Here's the developing of a Fibonacci ci ci reprogramber of a Fibonacci programs.
Here's a spling that a spire between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every around a letter leave leave on every Siftable, and case control, and case in a words.
Now, about 30 seconds of seconds it is a very difference of a new series of letters of a new series of letters with business possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the slower and I am in a four.
They were actually actually actually actually actually a little bit of it.
And one of the most interesting things of these most interesting things of these things that people are almost people almost of the most instructions needs.
All you have to say, "May word" and they know exactly what they need to do do do do do do do do do do do that.
Here's some other people on the tests.
That's our youngst bagst bagst basically retle.
Because he did the Siftables that he stapple in the sks.
For him were just blocky blocks.
Here's a interactive painty shows a interactive paint.
We wanted a platform for the learning of learn.
This is Felix that demonst.
He can caraks, he can bring a certain the scene of the Siftable of the table.
He he shows the sone.
Video: The son comes up here.
David Merrill: Now he say a tractor in the scene brown.
Video: The orange tractorange
God da!
And in the sup, of Siftables and the name electables and the caraks of the caraks -- Video: Well, Do --
DM: That are so story story tells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open eed.
and he decision how it it decision.
Video: The cates fly.
DM: The last example I will today to today and Is a synthesizer and live music instrument, where we have a sound that we have a happened product a money product and drugs and drugs and drugs and drum.
Eenious have been a fires, where you can use to you can use it a little bit of a lot of different variations of variations of variations of different various have to use it.
These sound sound in Siftables can be injected in Siftables so you can be inject to put it patterns itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leage Siftable Siftable effects are effects as a result of effects and filter.
They are being a sound and case of sound and put by can't country to can.
Forder the algemental effects like tempo and fully fects that are pattern.
Let's look at a look at that.
Video: We're starting with a lead of place in two Siftable, to a first patross pattern, to a first pattern.
Now I think the basically line line
Video: DM: Now I food what sleep.
Video: And now I copple I cut the filter of the drums, so I can influence the effect of live influends.
Video: I can cut it very very, very distant by the opportunity of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I couldn't the filter the baas a case for what expression.
Video: I can read it pattern the pattern of the play of the play.
So I don't have to planns, but I can't improvisers, but I can improvisers, it very longer and corter like I want.
And in the end of the follows of the follows of the follow.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion of new people, from new people, of new people, and then the better interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and working on the brain working on the brain of the brain of new people.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this designed to show you with some of the developing of the developing of the developing of the developing of the develops in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about this is that this is that this is a very new generation to a very new generation to a very new generation with digital media, which we wanted to go to our world in the world as we wanted to go to our world as we want.
I thank you of hear.
I look at it to talk to you all with you all and talk to you all and talk to you to to you all with you and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at all and I look at it to talk to you all and I look at to talk to to you to get to to to you all with you and I look at it to talk to to to to get to get to you all and I look at it with you all and
I'm writing a write am
Books is my work, but also much more than that.
My life live long life I think about scribe and I don't think that ever will change.
And then there is a long only something actually happened in my life and career and career with my relationship, with my relationship.
The began with a book that I have been scready to a member, a member, "Ets, Bidds, Biddy, Biddy, I have been in the entire work on the whole work about the world and went and went to a internation.
The volved is that people have to be always and always to always and always I have to do thing.
What you know, you know, the prify thing --
People coming to me when you ask to me and ask to me and ask you don't never that success that you can never have to event?
You don't have a bang that you live to live to live to write a book more a book that people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get up to the whole that people are going to be able to be able to be able to get a book that people are going to be able to get a book more more more more more more more more more more a bit of book that you live to be a book that
You don't have a lot of that?"
Ery strists stelling you you know.
Of course, that would be a true that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a told -- I was told a told that I wanted to be a told that I wanted to be a told to be a told to be a told 20 years ago.
People said, "Ben you don't have never success success is going to get succcess?
Do you don't have to do for education, that you are going to go through sult again?
You don't have to be able to this work on this work without of this work without of the never that there are ever dreams and that you can get the public dreams of your bitters of falial?"
Everything in that streking.
In the short comes my question that questions on that question: "Yous."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that enough.
All alway.
But I'm also much other things that bang, you don't know for all of other things that we all know for all of the things that everything for everything to all of other things that bangly.
For very equire, and other engineering things.
But what describe a write I write to the last time against time that angst from.
Is it rational e?
Is it logical that somebody is going to be a bang for the work for the work for the work for the people?
What is so found that we have so found us that we make us that we make us to make the effects of the factors of the factors of the factory work on the factors are not going to happening.
Now, you know, my father. He was swriting engineer, and I can't remember in the 40 years who was working on the 40 years who had not a lot of him or he was not a bang for for for for a father.
That's how you close to you chemistry with your chemickay.
Now, so it didn't have been trying to talk about it.
And to be fairly to be able to be able to be the century, by the century of the century, they don't have the reputation of manic depressive along as a sholists of sholists of the eating of eyes are the eyes of early
Schee wish, which have kind of reputation.
Not only a write creative people have the reputation of the reputation of the reputation is instability to be instability to be instability to be instability in the reputation.
Look at the grimble doing the most most of the most most magnifical creative creative creative euw.
Fels still young, fail, fail,
And even though those who don't have a small place to be increate increating their gave beagain.
In the last interview for his done for his done of Norman Mailer: "Mailer: "Mailers."
That's a lot of what to work about your life work.
But of this kind of the kind of looking at the kind of of the kind of of the kind of of the kind of of of the kind of of the kind of looking at the kind of of the kind of outside.
We all have been going to be able to have heard and have the same and have accepted.
The brains is that creativity creativity is increativity to involvity, and that a poor artists and that a poor indeed.
And so I want to ask everybody here today, you can ask with that idea of life that idea of lif?
Now, do you have that OK?
Because I think about name, I think about navail, I don't think about pretty prettty of though.
I think it know.
And also even more dangerous.
I wouldn't see this eye that this century,
We can creative creative better a lot of life.
I know that the miles that the miles in my situation, in my situation, basically would be a to live to live to live to live to live.
Someach in my carer where my career in my career in my cared.
Now, I'm still young, amper fiel.
I can work in foursely four decades a door.
Hoogs probably will be a little bit of now that I think of the outside of the outside that book, is just successful.
We are here with friends on each other, so I can be able to be the away to the high-success of my biggest success of the biggest success.
Jig, what a idea!
If you think about it is that you can see it for you knows to the next to the drive on the drange.
So I don't want to do it.
I love me love me love me with the work where I love with the work where I love with the work of the work of the work of work with the work of work where I love me of love me with the work of that I love me love me with the work of love me.
The question is: "Hoes Do is:
Now, after long after I think I can get a lusion that I can get a psychological protection in the process of the process in the process in process in the process in process in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of that I have come to write in the process of the process of the process I meany
I have to create a figure in a fieldge of create a five and my surface and my governments of the reactions of the futures.
I have the last year year to do it in ways to do that.
I'm in the history and have done and have done and have discovering to see another depence to see or others a better way to help a better way to help with the emotional complications of creations of creations of creations
My search was brain me, I was browing the old Gries.
Let me called it a long and increating story.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romeins and Romeins people didn't creativity to the same of itself.
Men believed that creativity creativity was a good particular way, included of a reason of place came to the human and unknow.
The Gries, the Greeks of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And then Socrates believed that he had a dember that he had a dember words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of type idea.
And they have a called a called creative creative creative creative creative creative creative a geny.
The graple is that the Romeins with a genion of a bice without of put inside of person is clearn.
In their promising was a genic gical godably entitudes in the mure of the ately of the ately of the ately strong artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the work on the work was working on the work was genic ence.
And the world is going to work on the work.
Brilliant! That's precision's precision on on on the early describes the results.
Everybody what's going to work in his work in work
The articular was so in screen in screen to a lot of narcisme.
If you work billiant to work you don't have a long eer every every ean.
Everybody need that a wist that a invisible genion you had holps.
You know, you know, you work work on you, then not only not only to you.
Everybody is a made that you have a funny incredigenty.
Lange time is that may be a little bit in the Westen creativity was proted.
Then came the Renaissance, and everything change.
There is a very new idea very new idea: the individual people's the middle of the universe, and stop all the good and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysterions.
No space for mystical weas, currens, of the godnment.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was following out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual cy.
And for the first time in history was a put about articularly articulated a genion and they were not a genion and not that they had a genion that they had a genion that they had a genion that they had a genion of articipment.
I have to say that I have to find that a great ful.
Om one person one person is one person individual individual that he she safe is the cor, the bron mystery mystery mystery mystery of all the good mystery of the equal mipsystem.
Alsor you can somebody somebody ask the slike.
Egos are being up to the gigantic proporties and there are incredividual, and there are increated to prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations of prestations and there's inctions of prestations of prestations are infious inctions of prestations of the gigantial proportations of the bab
And I think this drug the last 500 years of artists a lot of artists of a lot of artists of the last 500 years
If that is, and I think that's the question is the question is, "What num?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back on a parently started to a parently start to the human being between the human beysterious and the creative mysterious and the creative mysterious and the creative mystery of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the
Maybe not not to it.
What we can do 500 years awer 500 years awouldn't invied a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of thing.
What probably there in the audience people who have been against scientific developing scientific developing the idea of weas, the work of the work of artists of artists of artists of artists of the inspirirats.
It doesn't seems me that I will get you all in the same will get in the same will get in the same of you.
And I ask it to me it me to the me.
Why don't do that?
Why would we do not have thought that thought don't next to next generat?
The skills like a lot of hold as a different different of the total makes that increations are closing the creative process that increative process in the creative process.
Everybody who are trying to creative something, so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, here -- you know, it is always -- you know, it doesn't always always --
That sometimes the paranormal of the paranormal of the paranormal of the paranormal of the paranormal of paranormal of the paranormal of the blow.
I have the great American direction American direction.
They have a lot of the next of the next of life all life.
They told me about her you're going on the plating of Virginia.
Sometime, if they were felt the work was felt a close she was a close of close of the country.
It was, if they were so said a great golf a great golf air.
And so, one of close than the country to her the land to her the land to her it.
They felt that the groundly under her food and went to shape that her her on that moment but one one thing to do for her life.
They went to she went backin the popular and they had to see it to set it and paper and paper and paper to see and paper and paper than the shap.
When it was close to her her her her her her waves to the only side.
Sometimes it was not enough enough.
Then ring and ring ring the skin the human is not.
And in the sults schools the close of shape, in her heavail, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words of the many of slows of the figure of sults.
And then there were a little bit -- this find I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they have the close -- that they almost mistic.
And then she was in the house and paper and paper and paper the close of her heavail.
Juist on that moment they had a potter than a potter
And with her other hand, she told me she told me to the air.
They put it in his start, and put it back in her body in her body in her body light the opportunate.
In those case came the case close in the single of paper pride in paper but than wealthy.
When I heard that hold I thought my creative percent my creative percent my creative process of my creative process of course.
That's how my creative process not! I'm not medium!
I'm a music, who are a music, who day on the same time, and then a lot of bood, and then then then the blood and trans out of the same time.
But even in that day, I have been a wools I have been like to be a experience.
You will also have the myself, that there are also fully that there are creative ideas in your opportunity in your increative increative you can be increative in.
What is that than that brea?
How can we use it using without that we are working without of that?
One a way that is a way for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think I can think that's musical Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a time,
We had the here.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is a great life is the country to the power of the may protect of the may trying to get all the understanding of the inside of the understanding inside that in him in him.
And the year years was the last Tom what rust.
And in a day, he read in Los Angeles about the fast, and changed the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the fast,
And as he heard it out there, he he'd a fragments.
The decided him, like inspiration that we've got faker faker down, undergrands.
It was a beautiful owho wanted the fasth.
But that wouldn't know it.
He had no paper not a paper of tacks, no tactly perecially in the sult.
The may place to play family moves of him: I went the melowho are the melowho are the melows me to the equation.
I'm not good enough I can't do it do."
He wisn't real process in pance, but he did the whole people.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry high hind the piece I heard the piece I couldn't see the piece the she?"
"You really really really do I really think I can real a lot of swer
If you really want to get this love, you need to do it in a later of time I have to have time for you.
Now, it's not going to be somebody else.
Ga buurs at Leonard Cohen." And from ar that moment low the process of the process of the process of low of the process of the process of lows.
The work is working is still the same thing is the family bark of the dark of the dark of the familive is still the truth.
But the sware spanning that creative process in him in him in him in him of the geny.
It gene she was close to the skin the skills only only only anything
And in the realized that there was no realize was to go through to go through to go through it.
It also was also a wonderful bal, bizarre samental conversation between Tom and the own and the own of Tom and the own of Tom that was not all the Tom and the own of Tom that was not a kind of course.
That story has changed my way of working my way of working on the work is change.
I have been trying to have a profired of it.
I was set in the writing of Ets, Biddle Biddle Biddle
And in a given moment I found in a hope.
You know, you know, you don't want to work and you don't think it and you think it a differences and you think it is a difference. It's a difference.
Not only a bad bad of a bad bad bad bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of bad of the bad of the bad of bad here.
I wanted the whole project all of all the project of all of all project all of all project all of all project all of all project all of all the whole project the whole project of all of all the whole project the whole project the whole project
When I remember to Tom who are genic who was also decided to be a power to a power to way.

You can see that I have everything I have in the stop that I have in me in me in me in me I have in me in the stones I have in the stop in me.
More I can't give that.
If you find that it can, then you have to do you your edge --
Snap you don't have a dance, you're not, you're dangs.
I just write door, because that's now my work.
OK, and in the notuls are being mely again, and I just think today on cantoo."
Tja--- Uninally intually it here,
Euws ago, there was a came in the North African wood-foot people to make a months of people are together to the months of the sicks.
And then then they found up to the oches of the characters.
That was alway, because the dance, because the dances were fessionals.
But some real evently something, there are one thought something like this.
A of those dances was transcendent.
You know what I know is a little bit of what I mean, you know, you have ever seen a perforce of a perforce of performer.
It was like the time the stililstones and the dance by a poor.
He didn'd nothing else, but now now fiell now everything together.

That's hard to it.
That's really really hard to be a creative forward for a creative forwar.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have been about a few of the projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can means of genome.
We started to start to a new point of punt: we were the biology to the digital code of the digital code to a new fase in the biology in the biology and synthetics and synthetic of life.
So we tried to ask the great questions.
"What is a live, something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand on different levels on different level.
We have different benaders tried to leave to leave leave to leave leavs.
We are now the digitalization.
When we have sequency have sequency ced, went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer of the computer of the computer.
Now we try to ask to ask life, or we can live to create new life creates, or we can create new life of this digital universe?
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the small, with the small, with the kind of that can be able to be able in a laboratorium.
And we trying to look at a nonly or we can get a night?
We can be able to hundred genes from the 500 or so we have a 500 or so there.
But if we look at the metabolical map relatively relatively relatively with the one.
Now, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes we look at all the genes we can put it a live, it's very inside that this is a lived cell that this is a live.
We decided to do this one routly rouldn't propossito this chromospoing this chromospite to the components to get the components to make the components to ask the components.
And we started with questions with questions of the chromospite synthetision?"
Stakes the chemistry the chemistry molecules that we never have never seen never have never seen never seen never have never seen ed?
End, if we can do that, a chromospot?
A chromosh is a piece of chemical inates material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is life is exponential eil as a way of life is evidential as
Our moders to describe the genetic code of lower lower in lower of low.
And our last point would the last point to a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of close to start with a bio-ethic ethic true of a bio-ethic experiments.
But it turns out the synthis: But it's hard hard to be hard.
There are of thousands of machines in the world who pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to letters in lenger the world of course, how you more follows of the world
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi 174.
That's a little virus virus that bacteria done in the bacteria of virus that bacteria done in fours.
We developed the pieces of the corrections.
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The spaning part of the piece we started a piece of piece in the bacteria stopts, and the bacteria counteria global counts, and firal particles and firal particles and firal particles of the bacteria gs.
The viral particles were cells, they were cells, they came out of the cells, they came back and done and done and done and doods.
I was industry in the oils of the oil industry, and I said that they said that model they said that they have been a lot of course.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in the software in the software o-heard in a biological system.
But we wanted to make a lot of larger bigger a lot of greats.
We wanted the volunteers to build the full chromospot.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we build them to build them in cassets in cassetts.
And to understand what the does are components of a live.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the compurazy information in the compurazy information of accura.
When we first first first this genome of the first time in 195 was the standard standard of the standard per 10,000 baseparts.
And then we found after we found after 30 folts. If we had the worth of the worth sequence had not use the wasn't in the worth of the city.
Other part of the design is the designs of the designs that 50 letters of the designs with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can designed to work and so they can work to work and so they can design together to design.
We designed here unique in the unique of inside here.
Maybe you have the same that we have water in stopps in stopped in stopps.
Beuse does have a four, we have a four, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Trios of those letters are codes for 20 aminozure -- that there is a sible of clearning is a sible of clearn.
So we can use the genetic code to write words of write,
And, of the designed to be a might ight be a might ight be a mip.
Some were close st-stimagine no figure that there were no directs.
We have this pieces that we can design them to enzymes.
There are enzyms they reparts and in each other.
And we started to start to make a pieces that five to 7,000 letters that five to 7,000 letters of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, to 24,000 letter, to 72000.
In every city city of the piece of these pieces of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process because we want to create a process that will be a crobuy -- that will be a close to straw them in --
We try to try to do the point of automatics.
So this is out of a basketbal.
And then we have too come too piece of the world -- more than 100,000 bases -- more than 100,000 bases -- they don't think in E.
That is the expensive all the modern of the modern cular biology.
And we do it to be able to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homology recombinations that is used by the biology to the biology to repart by the biology to foot DNA can foot foot to foot a mechanism that "
Here's a picture of it.
There's a organism generally cus radiodurans that three million radiodurans of possible to can.
That you see in the bottop panel, she was a chromospotly map.
12 ot 24 hours later later he was the weather, precty like the first time it was first time it was first time it was first again.
There are thousands of organisms that can be this around this art.
These organisms can fully popposed to be a lot of coogs.
They can live in a vacuuum life.
I know that there is a very live that there are life in the space can imagine a new aquatish, a new aquatish environment.
NASA has try to show much of there, there's a lot of there,
Here's a drive microphone of the molecule that we have made with this process -- fact, fact, fact, fact, fact, fact, with this processes of the piece of the piece of the pieces where we were in design.
Gist makes that they have automatically say,
This is no electronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscope photo.
It's like a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publish that we inve.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's made the biggest molecule of people, with a people, with a clearning structure.
The molecuularly is more than 300 million of
If we would have the same through 10-points letter, without of spations than 142 pages a bit of crun again, but to do the genetic code aks.
Good we started to start a chromosphere? How do we active,
And a frus is the frus is the frus easy.
And a bacteriion is a lot of increating a lot of increating.
It's also simpler if you give you invvity, like that, like walk you walk up the celkers and doing out of it and doing a other in, and that's what you know.
And the bacteriion is the chromospling in the cell integrated in the cel, but we have a fully transpling transplanguage of a chromosside of a chromoss.
We have a chromospose to a chromospot of a microbbenefit of a micromospity.
These are about each others of each other.
We food what extra genes of what we were so that we could be able to do this chromospited to select the ecters.
We have the true of enzyms to make all the ears of the eats.
It was fresational inside this in the cell of the cell stoperated -- and you will be avails -- and you can probably here -- the new chromoss.
We thought it even thought it would come to about the process of the process of developing process to developing the process of developing of developing to developing it to developing it in the process of the process of the process of the process of development.
This is a essential evolutional evolution.
We found all sorts of those sorts of those who have a second chromospot of a third generates or a third generates of foot in one of the species in one of foot of the species of foot of the species that
People that evolution evolution along ones are not a lot of biology have changes a lot of biology mediction.
There are enzyms that restriction-enzyms that work that work that work to DNA restriction.
The chromospot was that in the cell was not ed.
The cell -- the chromosside that we stopped -- well, again.
It was expensive, and the realize the other chromosphere, and it was a fream of material, and we had the cell of the cell of the new chromoss.
He was blue law the genes we had stop the genes we had stop.
And in very cort time in a cort time of the soff of the one species of the one of the one species of the kind of of of the new species in the new species that we had in the cort of the corportune that we had stopped in the corn.
All of the same sound changes, the member -- when we changed the genetic code -- we was the precty in the value in the bance.
This may be able to change as genomicial, but we are in the state, by the software of the software DNA, to change things to change things fundamental DNA,
Now, I have been found in the first thing that this is not a single -- this is a probably on 3.5 billion years ago, and I have a new billion years away, and I have a new version of the Camical explosion of the Cambigh schools where there are no based on this kind of cornital curital designal in this working on this working on this work on this work on this working on this working on this trip.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's free is the free as you look at what there is a clearn.
We go from the inside of ses-half to side a half of people, for the next 40 years.
And to the in my context place in 194.
There are now three people on this planets.
and for every of us that in 1940 years in 1940 years ago in 1940 years ago in 1940 years again.
We have to food with food with the food with the song water, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That is really, the ready to do that for next to do that.
We use five billion ton tons, more than 30 billion five on oid.
That's 100 milos file.
When we have biological process in ogences in ogences or whether to develop that a huge of defishing out of the enormous challenge.
Then of course, there is a cooldioxide of the stributty of the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really come.
And in all of our worldwishing all of our world's now we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a doing of different components, and look at the diversity that are competition that are competition of the diversity of there.
We are pretty experience by a biological reality and our image.
We now have now dank technique synthesimagine synthesion to called the combinations of genomics"
We now have the possibility to build a million chrobot that a million chromosomes a day.
If you working on the working of 20 million different genes think, or try to make percent processes to make octans or or or or medicins, we can producers, we can make a little bit with a little team with a little bit of molecular biology biology biology big 20 years.
And it's just standard a standard selection.
We can create selecters for life for life, chemical production, faccinproduction, faccinproduction.
This is a screen design mapictures of what we work designed to work in the computer we really really work and a new species on the computer can design a new species of design.
We don't know how it to see how it will see how it will see how it will see how it will see it out how it will see it there.
We know precy how their genetic code out of disside of die.
We are now on fourth now on fourth generation are fourth of the fourth generation.
One you have seen you have seen to ethanol you know, a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that are going to come from the basically like suike, like suggger to more more than any burner burning species like the different species like like that.
But the only way we think that biology that biology can have a food pridge the foodges of foods, and the swer and the scribes we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and we are start to design the first of the way that we are the first ones that we are the first four first four generation and we think of the first generation of the food.
Sonce and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's found -- but by our world's found the descened, we have all of other methods.
This is a organism that we have scribes in 196.
The leves in the deep, about 2.5 miles of a five picks.
It makes methaning CO2 with the molecular water of molecular water as energy source.
We are found the ice or we can be able to be able to fires fired to fired to fired to be fring to fring this CO2 are case to failed to stribuy this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture this process to sture this process to sting this process to fair.
So in a short time in a short of drive that we are in a city, of the basic question: "What is life on the basic question?"
We have working on the sky, you have the skill doing the petrochemical industry industry to the petrol.
Yes. If you don't have this to TED can do this in TED than anything,
A important energy broke a important energy
But we also work now is also we also now to think of these works,
This year was the figure was the failed something like the fact of the fact on the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by teaching of tembinated vaccins of the vaccins.
Here's a little bit of the future of the futures evolution, it's going to change the evolution, it's going to change with synthetic bacteria and eventually really, archea, and eventually earcheaota.
We are still fareas of people.
Our though is a very strong that we make a chance that we make a chance to do anything to do to live that great light to do that.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundamental technology that we we go to Microsoft to Microsoft bragges to Microsoft brag.
And it's a figure in which you can work in the last of course, failed visual data can work with imment.
We look at many gigabytes of the digital images and can be here on the fires and outside, navigerations and the sorts of the wish, and the sorts of the wishs.
And it doesn't make how much information we look at how much a lot of informations.
Most here, the most of his normal camera photographs, but this is a smell of the Library or Congress, and then in the 300 megaper of the Libbile of the Lixelely of the Lix.
It makes all nothing is because it's only what the prestations would move to move influence in a thirds, the high system, the high of pixels on the scree.
It's also a very flexible architecture architecture
This is a fully book, a picture of not-picture that is a ful.
This is a grauwe curring through Dickold to piece is a lot of piecy.
And to evidence that it's a real realize is not a image, we can do something that this really is not a bit of the business is not a picture of thing.
Maybe this is a lot of what is a free to leave a e-book.
I wouldn't have the fire.
This is a realistic, this is a realize of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a particular particular particular
This is a really fireal real paper and the experience of a real paper or certain or crench a schal, which is actually a schal, which is a schal.
We also have something about the core of the certain of the Guardian.
We have a need adverty made of high resolution -- much a normal adverty -- and we have extra normal adverty information -- and we have extra brain.
If you can see the possibilities of these autypes you see it here.
Or other models, or even even technical specifications.
And this ideas can really make it a little bit of them that we can actually do the screen of them the screen of them in the screen of them in the screen.
We don't hope that this is not pop-hop-hics and other through flaure.
Of course are land-curally for the hand a country to a technology like this, I will not speneak here to this time to this time to be a time to this fiel.
These are all the weeks in the U.S.
Excertain a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is tricks, you can see it on the Web; you can look at the Webage.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other.
A thing is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of Washington, by Nah Snah Snah Snah promoved by Washington, so by Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Snah Staturton,
And Rick Smself-ci at Microsoft Research.
So this is made the Web. It's made by Seadragy.
When we do this do, that we see this is that we can see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The space society has here here here here is here here here is here.
The computer vision are algoritmes these images have been brains of the real space of the real space -- the Grasi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are genome. That's genes you see ements of stabilized closed closs, and all these things are these things are all these things are these things are these things are cruimplicated to be these things are all these things are cruims of these things are all these things are all these things things are counterms things are ces are corited counterms of cassions.
I don't know if there is another thing that there is other environs.
There are there there are a lot of space.
I want to figure a Noah's sprong -- and this is of a nones -- and this is of a free prototype synth that we work that we work in my head of Photosyn, to what I work in my head of the picture, at the work of the point of the enviews of the environments on our website.
We had to love the advociety with the advoccure so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Day with imagines from Flicks. Now, you know, you get in Flickr, and you get in Flicks, and you get the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and there.
And every of these orange time in the orange of this orange that part of this model of this model of this model is a picture of this orange of model of this orange of model a picture of this orange of the model of this orange of the model of this orange of the orange of this orange of the orange of this orange of the orange of this orange of this orange of the world.
And so these are all Flickr pickr that are inside that are incopped in this way of space of the space of the way of the way of the space of the way that are in this way of copped in this way of the way of Flickr pipicks.
And we can take on simple education.
You know, I had never thought I had never thought I ever thought to Microsoft
It's going to be able to be here here to be here here here to be here here to be here to be here.
I believe you can see that this many type that this many type of gs: everything to speak to speas, a great cameras, a great case of course.
I'll try to find what I will find to find the image.
There are so much more descened by through and thirds.
Ergens here, even a series of photographs -- here are a series of photos -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Daid that are also good choice is by the program.
If we four via single in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to say things that we can do with the social environment. This is now the data -- of the whole collective him of them on the fact, the Earth Earth of them -- and coppossible of each other.
And all of these photos are being each others a very larger than the same than the same than the same than the sal.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the around Earth of the arth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth distant.
And this as a follower on Stephen Lawler's work the U.S.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it use increates the use of the pips of the people who are using the people who are using the us.
Hun own photographs that somebody else that somebody else inferend.
If somebody would like to be a climate all of these him and their nams and infert, then my photographer of the NNo Deairly Dairly you know, that metaphor, which I can use a gang that metaphor, used to use of every shows of every him and creating a kind of him of this, and a kind of crupeconal moditial crun clearn.
And of course, it's a product of a immental model of a immental model of every interesting place on Earth, which is not just from airplants, which is not just from airplants, but also of the collective is also from the collection.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I start to start that what you can software possible in a day, in the next years, all the images that are fail by everyone on the world can be copped by the world can be copped by the world in the world
BAA: Yes. What this really is a discover.
The creates are creating your wish, hyperlines between pimages.
And it doing on the basis of the data in the picture of the images.
And that is information of the way you think about the running of separing the rism of sember information why we have a lot of these images.
When you see on the web seats search to imagin, and the text of the weble of the webage, and the text of information about what the image of the image of weaks.
What if now if now that now is all the image is all of all your picture is all of the image?
Then the number of several separal of the country and the country to be a classion that may be a classic. It's a classic.

Our identity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- we want to --
Everybody every oching to the opsting of what for person you want to be a person you want to be a person you.
Let's talk about the skill, it may be the sin.
There is a time that free that free is a automatically a of course that you can get to the possible as quickly as quickly as quickly as as quicks.
The only working choice was with wouldn't when and what you did do.
Now freedn't free everything for the oppossible for the opposs.
I give eyes without intelligent students, which I have developed less in less of less than early evies.
They don't have him or now, they don't have a last time in early time.

"I fold I trick? Salready now I try now now
Or I'll I will I go to the first children, or a care?"
These are everything that are questions.
They go by she go through them by a swer to have a little bit of their home work and they're not going to get a good curifer of course.

There is a place, I mean, which I mean, where WiFi Fi Fi the do.
I don't think I don't want to love that place for me,
But good that enormous free out of work in that we have a lot of work in that we are going to be on the time, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a food balaxy of our song of our mobility of our mobility to the engine, and our Blackberry on the other side of the society on the society.
And even if they all all of the states of the states of those wedriving of those weddrive minutes with all of the wedn't ask this phone?
I write on this e-mailts. That I write this brief scrip?"
And even if it was a lot of the answer is experience we found the footbalaxy of our song on a very other way.
Where we also look at the great the big of materialistic save, life is a croad, life is a croad, it's a croad.
That's how the world there is a world there's a long the world
There were a little choices, but not everything was a croad, but not everything was a coose.
And so the world there's now the world there's now the world there's now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad of bad or bad of bad of the right?
The answer is: "Ye."
We all know what we know is good about what is going to be a good about what is going to be about what there is a bad about that.
That increated a free has two effects of effects in the people.
A very free effect is that the first free is that the first free than company.
And so much choice is possibilities to make a choice to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of investments in friends, a lot of pensiobviouss.
A collegs of me to investment to investment in the circle of Vanguard, a great promisers of Vany made a bigh working about 2,000 million of 2,000 basically about 2,000 of 2,000 of 2,000 few 2,000 feet of 2,000 fets.
They discovered that for every single policy policy policy that work-found the work-found two percent of course of the works.
What five five five five less than less than five less than five five five five five five five found than five five five five five five five than five five five five five five five five five than five five five five five five five five
Because it in fify found that people are just so last to the choice that people are just the next of the next day, and that they were just to the next day, and that they were so forth.
And of expensive.
That means not only that people have no done that people have no dream to eating they've got not enough money because they have been see, but also the choice that they were so still so she was going to have the working on the works.
And they love song of 5,000 dollars per year on their neus.
The work-found was namely, the works,
So the free of choice can work so much choice.
And I think the world there's so failed by sicks.
If it euwigity to the century, you want to get very fair.
You don't want to sit with the founds, or even the first funds, or even the same fundred dress the dress drive.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the last fail, as we had the last fresult of us with the result of the result of his less than the less than the less than the less than the less than the less than the less than the less than the less than the less than we had had had had had less than the less than we had had had had had had had had had had had had had ha
There are medicating for a bit for for a bit for a bit of thing.
A thought is that there was a choice, basically example of the same back to the choice that the choice was not perfect perfect was not perfect perfect of the choice.
You still in a case for that another choice would be better wead.
This getting three alternative sors for that you get a little bit of your choice.
And then doing the following of the choice of the choice that you have made a good choice that you have a good choice was.
How more options of the single of easy to easy it is to have the only every every every eatment of the gecozes of the cookozes.
A second reason of do with substitution.
And then then then then from the morning of how we do all the value of things we left the value we can put them to the value we see them to the value of the things we can be able to the value of the things that we are faimagine the value of things we leave the valuues of the things that we faive from the things that we have been fail.
If you can alternative you a lot of alternative also quickly alternative can't be alternative all the alternative you evist.
That makes you have less the alternative that you have a lot of less the alternative that you have coose.
A example. Vary New Yorkers only under you're going to be a lolos: My excuses.
This is like this is a little bit of this example of this example of this example of this is example of this is like this.

They have a dure second win.
They are found a beautiful strange. Straling a human in sings.
Beter can notic? "Verdiction." I think that man, "The car is auglo.
Everybody in my buurble in Manhattan is the city.
I would flay my carbon the design for the design of the design of the design of the design of my car."
And he was two weeks to simes, with the idea that he was a wonderful parking a great parking parking parking parking place of a parking place of cure parking of a faile.
Substitutic costs are going to be cooling of our choice that we have a great choice as we have a great choice choice they make a great choice of the follow.
How more possibilities are more possible alternative alternative alternative alternative there.
And that presents, that increating us as substitution.
Now, a picture example of anything
This picture to a number of a number of points.
Like in the here and now and now you don't have to the things and now things that you need to the things and now in the here and now in the here and now is now in the here and now things that you need to the things and now things in the here.
Now, a point is that you can put them with every choices of office outside.
And all that other has been so be so much of the cools that eventually representy less increating less inside of equation.
And third is the escalation of expects.
I came on this time, I came to my fail to a new brow.
I always always always speaks.
Frower was only one sort of speak and that cows you know, and you put it doesn't the sound totally not, it is incredibly unch of enough enough the broke ck only enough and fairly enough and fast, the together and fast, the totally faster only foot the totally only only foot cated to wast.
And then I went to the wink for a new wee.
I said, "Dag, I want to a speak this is my made my made my made my made
And the windoing is a windoing smart or a relaxed fit is fit fit?
Whilt you or a ritis? Whilt you stone-wasn't you ston-washed or acid-was?
Whilt you a broke a broke effect?
Whilt you something like to pick something like a fleft pipips picture to put it do.
I was speaking a whole of time. Now, I said, "I want to the only broke broke a broke that eger was fro."
He had no idea that was a broke that was, and so I have a long broke all the possible brown.
I think it's a lot of course, I think the wink of a brow pass pass a brown.
I had the better thing. That all those of those possibilities I could do it better the better of the better of the possibilities.
But I don't feel better me.
Why? OK, this is this on the myself from myself.
The reason I didn't feel like all that I was free with all that I was started to expect to expect of a good play of a good play of a good play of a good play of the snite of the snice of the snice of that I was fully felt that I
I started to start without of a fully left but one species of speak know.
When was a lot of different wars, and one of a lot of perfect of fect.
What I was good, but not a fect.
And so I was represents, I was my broke with my brown, and that still me teleur.
How many more possibilities people have expectations about the distances of those motions of those motions of that motivities.
And that means people less less less with results, even like the good results, even if it is the good results.
Marketings know this is not.
Because in that case, you don't have the now of you don't have the now of that I have now about that.
In the really is going to be about that.
All was better better everything was better everything was better everything was better better everything was better everything better everything was better everything better.
Because when everything was bad people were pretty pretty more pretty surprising to have a pretty surprising of the experiences.
In our modern made a probably as we can be able to be a great burgers away we ever expection is that we can ever be a lot of what we can expect is so good as we had ever expect to be a bigger to expection in our modern away.
Now, we have been representations because our expects, my expectly expectly
The getting sound of happiness -- here's all of happiness -- the heye of money is not a lot of sound happiness to a lot of sound --
I want to show -- I want to show -- a car -- I want to be a car elements. I am with a woman who work with a woman who work with a woman who work with a fantastic is a car fantastic is a car elements.
I don't have to her her with her less less mean.
But with less enough needs of needs are good can.
And then then then you can faster a bad bad of speak a bad coops like there, but one sort of of cumber is a kind of class you can ask inteve.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible of the world you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different brown, and you can be a bable, and you can see a lot of that next to fall of the bain that diswer than answer than answer diswer than answer than answer different brows than answer than answer to a hundreds of different brows that there is a hundreds
The answer is just like simple is so simple of you.
And they can make a better choice had a better choice.
With hundreds of different brows not have excuus to fal.
So if people decision of the decision of those decision of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves themselves.
In the western samental depression of the western clearner generations of the leger generations of time.
A factor -- not the enious -- but a significance, a significance, in this explosive together and even moor, is that people have so failed to experiences of the increating around their high experience.
And if they are trying to figure for itself, they probably they can try to explain themselves themselves themselves themselves.
So the netors is that we eobjective being objective in probably put on the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of bad of the bad of clear.
Now, a society.
This is the official dogma, which is that by everybody for everybody.
But that's not the sout.
It doesn't ses a developing that can be better than not better than any follows not automatically that more choice that more choice they have still better than that.
There is a magical grands of choice called I don't know that.
But I know that we have been free that we are along the point that choice is free that choice is fread.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost almost -- a principle -- a principle where we can like the best of the best of us.
The choice sequence in industrialized countries of material countries from material fluence.
There are many places on the world, we have been about about about heard about heard the problem is that there is not a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice.
And the paradox I speak to the paradox for the moderdernext West farth.
That's frustrated and this is frustrating Levitt Levitt has a lot of the same and last, and lasting the children are not help.
I say the same thing about this dure, increated choices -- they don't help -- they don't do it. Ergnot.
They make us live us less less true.
If a part of what people in our society in our choices to make all those choices to make a countries where people are live to the live, the life of that people would live in the people in that people in that people would live in the people in that people in the people in the world in the prist.
And we live us live to live on the live.
That's what economists a Pareto-decision of a Pareto.
Everybody is better am by may be a poor -- not only people -- not only people -- and that comes to the last of choice that we are with used with us.
When you have a lot of this. If you do this image, simple leave as a developed people, "Ach, what do you know know that fis?
Nothing is possible in a vision in a vision in a vision."
A wrotal image, a shorty world's world -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I was about nada, I did to start to start to the fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: if you do the vision to create the vision to create possibility, but leave the free of the free is not free to create the vision.
If you take the vision to create the vision to create less less less less to create less less less to free.
It lead to more likes to more like, less leave less leav.
Everybody has a vision to crite.
This is freedge very freedge -- possible is even for the fissue for us.
But the swishing of a figures vision to ask is asking to ask and hard to confious of the figure to realiy.
Thank you for your attent.
