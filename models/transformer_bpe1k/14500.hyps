And I show you see these two dia's showed to show that the police cap, that the last three million years of three million years of the vast 10 perpercent of the U.S. with 40 percent fix percent croms of the U.S.
But this is actually the real problem of this particular problem because it doesn't the dictor of the ice of the ice.
The ice cape on the North Pole, in a sense, in a way, the climate system.
It looks in the winter and critics in the summer in the summer in the summer and critics in the summity.
The next slide I showed is a version of what the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened the last 25 years of what happened is happened to the last 25 years of what the last dia of what the last is a dible dised.
The permanent ice is clear in rood.
As you see, it looks at dark to dark dow.
That's the years, the equired of the winter.
And it critical in the summer in the summer right.
And the called permanent ice, five years or old or ance, almost like blood is almost like blood is almost like the body is almost like the body is such here.
In 25 years, the way this is going to go to this for.
And that's a problem because the wrorn around the North IJsea Sane IJsea sea very big amount of the North of amount of cools in meth. And then when it designer is designed by microbes in methane.
And that is case with the total revice of the atmosphere, that would be able to double unch of the atmosphere.
In some of a few undid in Alaska borrely in the water.
As went down, Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another undiep me.
Whoo! And she's OK. The question is whether we will be able to be that are going to be
A reason is that this huge is that this huge sources Greenland from the north.
This is a smell aterriver.

These stromations take away to be flightly flight to be flight to be flight.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the months months scientists scientists that whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice in the West of the South Pole, and the melty of the South Pole, with a few underwaters.
The whole continent of six meter, as Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the Himalaya, the biggest ice mass, that are now, a few years ago, that were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is to help of his drinkwater of that smell driving the global population of that smell driving the world.
In the Andes, this glater the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more strowing.
But when they disappeared, and then windown, it also drowater.
In California fication of 40 percent in the snow pack of the Sierra.
It comes back in the water reservoires.
And as you could ream the predictions are nstigated.
This global dreamed dreamed to a dramatical styce.
And the number of natural around the world is cited with an incredible and never never seeing and never seed.
For more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the pursue of a historical context than cumulture.
In the last five years we've got 70 million ton of CO2 in the last 24 hours.
25 miles every day in our oceans, Kook good to the east in the eystal area of Stille Ocean, from America, west, and every single of the Indian instance, there's a drager of the Indian alation of subcontinenction of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, name, name to be fix, which is fired for 20 percent months of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extinclude of the two largest of China.
And there was a previous more cities.
But we see a moment --
These are the cities, which the burned that the built of the building was annulected in the last few years and where groups and alternatives and where the last ast generation.
There's a political stride on the country.
The cities, and oil induste induste that is a year 250 million dollars to promots, which is a texts, which is a texttility is a testing cool.
That image to think about something like this.
And the church was in Tennesse, in Tennesse, in Tennesse, four billion liter closer cools in Tennesse,
You probably have seen the news in the news of it.
This is the one after a greatest depicture, in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertist of the coolling lindustry was this.
Video: "Salk the coolman is a blice, a blice, operated chure catel.
He's overfluence here in America, and he's successars that our economy.
Frosty the citied coolman becomes on the day well.
He's a too, and captiple and called their bunch of their bane."
Here is a big comes a big part of the cool in West Virginia of the steel in West Virginia of the citie.
The biggest mine worker of the land is the big biggest bass of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship says, "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection for Klimate campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of it.
Video "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious threat.
That's why the reason why the most important thing is to give a gigantic contributed to reclassing on the light for the light of the truth of value of value of vality to the value of value of vality to the value of value to the light of
Feity, is not sal.
We find that it is -- and it's a soon -- and the room --
So, you don't make a single about climate change.
Let me only one.
Video: Acteur: Schone cool, you have a lot of talk about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern modern coolcentral.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of what lawn.
But that's the sound of sound sound sounds of society.
And then, the thing that the fure burnition of cities, one of the most important causes of the Earth, change the earth is change the remarkable of the Earth, the remarkable of the eath of this.
Look around this is the wonish technology of the cools today.
Al Gore: Einthese, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: America wrong in crisis, the economy, the economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire of these things are all of these things is our dependence of fossil fuel soil fuel coluile and inmported oil.
But now there is a durfree, new solution, new solution to get this.
America of 100 percent of 100 percent schone electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to work on the work of the Earth, and the operator, and the Earth.
And then a solution that is understand that comes up to solve our problems on solution.
Repower America. Ontt-dow.
Al Gore: And the last state.
Video: Stem: It's going to give America to give energy.
One of the speed ways to make a end of the pendence of our planet to our planet to our planet to do very planet to help.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man investment to create investment to create good investment to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Tich.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking African speak to everything like to be you, and if you want to be all of it.
If you want to go to this, I go to go ament."
We need to go and far.
Thank you.
I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I policy comes back to get back with a hold about how that works.
So I mean. For degenes that doesn't have anywas: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment in the way in the way in the understand it.
It need to be the circumstances that were understand less than a billion a billion of the universe started to 600 million times a second.
And Enorm ambitions, this!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Bangs in detectors in detectors that I work with the ATLATLAS. It is detector -- 44 meter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS. in the mouth of ATLAS.
On 10 september shapes in the first time we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was genomes by ATLAS.
That successary for a party in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle particle that is all around, the LHC ging, and with operating the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and which is a piece of the LHC, and in the detector in the detector of the LHC glowing in the detector of the first particle particles.
In other words, when we saw that picture picture on 10 September knew that the machine works, which is a huge winning working.
I didn't know this the largest of the biggest right, or this, or this, if someone to Google and saw that the Internetpage.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of a cultural impact that is made a cultural impact that means have made a scientific impact that means have made a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what had to do with these golden bets.
That draws ago, 13 thousand amper resources when the machine on the power.
The engineers are going to be able to say, "Not value. It's totally small th."
They can do that because they are superateither than they're superature on all longs.
So on miles on the good degrees than the space between the gars, that can be wirely that are wirely between between between the glows that are wirely between the space between the space between the gars, colder than the space between the gars, colder than the space between the space between the space between the space between the goots.
In one of the connection between the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, sat a constructive.
That was a wirelectric ished something that was increating 13 thousand against 13 thousand amples that 13 thousand ample of amper resources of the same thousand ample of the became this.
This was the result.
This is another inpressecurators when you realized that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 centimeter than 20 centimeter in the timeter than 20 tons of the course.
We decided about 50 magnets.
We had to get them from half of it, what we did.
We all have been partypice.
Now they are back to away back to away.
Eind the LHC will be the LHC weather intact.
We will be able to be able to be able to be expectations in juniverses in you, so we can go up with the further and further than the buildings of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, that unhappens to the debate of scientific research, the value of scientific research.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be a further than ever the LHC.
I mean, I show the English scientister Humphrey Davy, I did the device depended experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Farday, this is so dangerous of human being is so dangergerous than the human mine of human mind than the human mindship of the science, and not have been definition of the nature, and we discovered that we have been defician, and that we discovered that we discovered that we discovered to design in naturew design in the designed that we dicatelectribe discovered that is that is that is that is that are discovered that are not designs are not have been discovered the wordn't have been died in naturew design the worworworwordly
Thank you very much!
I would want to start to ask with you to get back to your kids to your kiddle and then you play with block and then you play with you.
And then you discovered how to understand how to understand and awing them to the way to learn and conscious problems by the way of space and depended with space relationships.
Rumultiply is strong because of the world to understand the world to understand it.
If a information of inspired by the name of physical interaction with physical interaction with my advisure of Pattion and my advisure with my advisure -- I started to ask -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer -- what would use a computer -- in a musical fure of the engineering of a musical fure of digital fingeration that we could be able to fix information with a picture information with a social fical fyces in the information of digitire.
And then you can orders like we want to learn this?
This question of us so considered us so concerned to search of Siftable.
Corty is a Sifty a Sifty interactive computer ter in the size of a cookood.
They can be able to be put up to the hand they can be able to feel any understand they put them up and they contact a screen and wirely contact.
The nuclear understandled is the physical handled like blocks to understand it is the physical hundred by understand it.
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
There are these aid parts of these aid diculates are more physical different of their movement and even of their movement and even of the way we have to discovery, there are different new and like, there are different new and likes of leup.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftished is institum to show a video to show to do count and other, and other, and other, and other.
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious conscious.
Indicately, they will be interested to each other.
If they are becoming up to be able to be able to be able to be what are being is being to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the case and then they can be suppose.
And they feel understand helling them and helling.
We realized that algaust, one of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of the interesting of all of the interesting of everything like a small of the interesting of a small of the interesting of a sliquid as it was a liquid as a solid as a liquid as a set of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interest
In this example of the example, three Siftables for and I can use them to get them to get them to go into a legal small, where they are being human.
And if we have government, we have a little bit back to what we have to be back.
There are some cnappe possibilities for the educational play play play and logics that we want to give things to give things that are possibility to prove, and the result and the result of the eator.
Here I show -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmation.
Here we show you a game between a crossing between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every runny in every single letter on every Siftable, and formed words are controlled in a words.
And after 30 seconds it is the condition of the condition and different a new series of series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, they try to make it and there's a video of it.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these apply passion is that people almost not almost people almost no instructions need.
And everything you have to say, "Make word," and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people to the test.
That's our young basically test, right-basically subject.
And it seems that he just just the Siftables wish to stack it.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive paintings of the interactive.
We wanted to learn a platform for the learn of language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new karker in the scene of the Siftile of the Sifty with that characters of the table.
Here he show you get the sun come.
Video: The sun comes up up to it.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good though! Yeah!
By shape the shiftables and the name today he can put the characters to get the characters of the course, "Wlly.
DM: And so his own story tell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a story with a open ended.
and he decision how it walks.
Video: The cat flying air.
DM: The last example I think I'm going to show Is a synthesizer and live music and live music to be recent to develop on a sound, where every Siftables and drules and drugs and drum and drum.
And every has been four different variations where you can use it to be able to use what you want to use it.
These happened in a soundly Siftables in the sound, so that you can be increated to itself the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the sound.
You put a sound sound in the pattern by the pattern of a leg Sifty of a legal effects as reverb and filter.
They are become to a sound sound and sounded by can.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are pollut on the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern of the algular pattern of the alghtly effects like tempo and follow pattern of the algemental effects like tempo and volumembers that are pattempo to be a
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a lead. And we started by a first pattern by a extra lead.
Now I place the base line thing.
Video: DM: Now I feel what I work work on the work work on it.
Video: And I copple I can put the filter on the presentation of the drum of the effect that I can influence.
Video: I can get it it a celebrating by the cans of the tempo block of the tempo bloce.
Video: DM: Now I copple I can buy the filter on the baas for what more expression.
Video: I can repay it pattern reschool while it played playing.
I don't have anything to plann, but I can improvisers, but I can improvisers, the getting and shorter like I want.
Met of the dimms of the dimms of the volume Sifty to show to show to show to show to do it on the left so.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make my passion of new people, interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and working on the brain and work our brain and working on the brain and work on the brain and works on the brains of new people, and working on the way our brains of new people, and working on the
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of early possibilities that we develop the developing of the developing in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the attack is that this is only new generation to a very new generation of virital media, which is the information with digital media, which is the information like to our world as we wanted to count.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and talk to you all and to talk to you all and I want to talk to you all and I think of you to do all and I look at it.
I'm writing awriting.
Bues is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life I have been a long for writing and I don't think that ever will change that ever change.
And yet there is unless of something actually happened in my life and cared, and cared, and cared, by my relationship to my work on my work on and cared.
And it started to a book that I wrote a book that I wrote a memotion, "Ets, Biinnen," that is very in testing my first work on the world and a international constitution and a international imagine.
The consequences that people are all over and always to be damness as I mean.
Worly, what -- -- does --
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you and wondered that you can't be succcess that you can evaren?
Don't you get to your entire life to keep your entire life writing to be published to be publishe?
And then you don't have a bang fore?"
Suststities, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much be. But I remember that I was back to 20 years ago, when I told a teener -- if I wanted to be a told that I wanted to be a teently --
People said, "Then you don't have a bang that you never get succces?
Don't you get to read for education, that you know, you get to subject through to it.
And you don't have to be able to be your life to this work on this work without that there is any something that is ever going to be able to the public broken on the public broken bitters of falen?"
Something in that stread.
In the shortly comes to my answer to the questions of this: "Ye."
Yes, I'm bang for all of those things that are being familid.
Always of it.
But I also have a lot of other things that you don't want to know that all of it.
For sea sea seeds, and other entire things.
But what concerned writing to write myself where the angst time that angst from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is being to be able to be able to be work for the work for the work for the work on Earth on the Earth of the work of the work for the work of the work of the work that somebody on the work of the work that somebody on the work of the work that somebody is to be somebody to their human, in the
And what is so such as a creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects on the effects of the mindity, something like a different species of work on the work of work on the work of the work of work in the mind of the effects of the minual processes that is so not happens.
Now, it was my father. He was skilled to engineer, and I can't remember in the 40 years that he was whether in the 40 years that he didn't have a bang for it.
And so of this "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry, how is it with your chemistry,
No, so not worried about it.
To be fairly to be fairly engineers have been through the century of the century of the century is not the reputation depressive alcoholists of view of the century of being alcoholists of engineers have been fairly to be fairly in fair.
Scheating wonder, that have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have black the reputation human beings have a lot of the rather than being people.
Look at the grimix dodental doctor, the most magnificry creative mine of the 20th century.
Many stick young, often by own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own through own own through own through own through own through own through
And even those who are not a self-fiar placed, under their gave me.
In the last interview for his death said, "Mailer: "Mailer: "Met of my books is a piece of myself."
That's what to say about your life work.
But of this kind of looking at this kind of looking at the same time.
We all have been heard the earlier and have been accept with "sudgested all of accepted.
The hearing is that creativity is that creativity is increativity is increativity to be an artist, and that a artist, and that will lead to ellen until of the until of thought is that is going to leave it.
And that's why do I want to ask everybody today to be question: You can you with that idea liv?
Did you have that OK?
I think I think about it is a good about navail, I don't think about a pretty thought to be pretty on thought.
I think it's further.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see this century that this century.
We can creative mine a lot of better increative mind to live better in.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be dark to that dark to that dark in my situation.
Seker the pase which my careers in my career.
Go one, I'm young, I'm young, amper say, "OK.
I can make four decade, four decade.
Hoogast probably will be anything I have published by the outside world as the work that is following on that is extraordinary succcessful book.
And we're here with friends on each other, so I can do it you get it to you know the biggest success: highly behind me.
Yemy, what a idea is a little ide!
If you think about it, if you know it is to you know it on the morning to the next in the morning hours to the drive in the morning to the drive and the drive of the next and you know it down, you know, for you know, you know, for the morning for you to the needs.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love to the work where I love I love with the work where I love I love love to love me love me where I love to love me where I love to love me where I love I love the work where I love the work of the work where I love of love I love to love with the work where I love the work of lovalue of love me.
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after long after a long navail, I can only get by writing as I can only be a psychological protection in the process inbuilding.
I have to be able to create a safe distance between me, and my government between me, and my government between me, and my control antly pications on my future publications.
I have been sent to ways in ways to do that.
I think of the history and I think of the history and have ship in other societies to see or others have a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative people to get creative perpercent of creative process.
My search has been brains me braw me to the old Gries.
Let because it's a long and complicated.
In the time of the old Gries, and Romeins believed that creativity was fully, people not have a creativity of themselves of themselves in the age of the old Gries.
Men believity that creativity was a good partly reason that was a wonderful place to the human place to the human reasons.
The Greeks call these necessary of creativity "demonen."
One Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of a kind of idea.
And they have a called a called creative spirit creative spirit of a genius.
The funny is that the Roman enegger with a genius, and a bunch of charge in the entire person in the entire enter.
In their policy was a genial entity of magical entity that are operately in the mure of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artist, the work of the work of genius.
And the way he shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's precise I had the first time I talk about the first time I talk about the result of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work.
The artist, the artist, in the protection of the constance,
If you work work on the work of you all the early one.
Everybody knew that is a unvisible genius, you had heard to have heard it.
Well, you know, you work on the work of you, then it doesn't only on you.
Everybody knew you had a predicted genius.
Lange time is that in the Westen creativity was creativity to the Westen creativity was devicies.
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change.
There is a very new idea very new idea: the individual humans is the average point of the universe and mysterious and mysterious and mysterious and mysteries.
No space for mystical beings, atator, communities of the goddanger world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believity creativity is completely from the individual free came out of individual
And for the first time in history was the history of artists said that they had a genius, and not that they had a genius.
I have to think I have to be a big fure that I have to find.
On one person, one person, one person, one of individual individual is to believe that he or she or she or the century, the essenti, the essentially mystery, of everything that is -- creative and the known force is -- that is -- that is -- that is -- that is a lot of any human psyches.
Anybody ask somebody ask to clike.
Egos are being up to gigantial proportions and there are universe to be expectations of prestations on prestations of prestations on prestations of prestations and there.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years a lot of artists have made a lot of artists made a lot of artists that the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists purpossible of artists of artists have made a lot of artists a lot of artists a lot of artist.
And if that is so I think that's so so the question: "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back on a older understand the creative between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
Well, we can have 500 years of rational homething to make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the same played in a 18 minutes of hour.
And probably seath in the audiences of people who have been realized scientific devely about the idea that either than the work of the feed-pooder the work of artists of artists inspiration to inspirit of artists to inspirit of the pools of artists in the audience.
It doesn't seem to me.
And I ask it to me it.
Why not?
Why would we didn't have thought that power?
And the snet as much as much as much as all the other explainty of the total calculatory that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have to create something has try to create something -- so in fact, so in all the presense of the entire engineers doesn't always be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to creative process --
That sometimes almost paranormally inful.
I have unled the went American directional American direction.
She is close in the next. Her whole lives in the next.
She told me about her jeugginia.
Somes, if they were on the work on the work on the work she was a close to come, the country.
It was, so said so, if there was a big golf air, as as wish air.
So'll be close close than the country to her it.
She foot that the ground, understanding and went and knew that is her on that her on that her on that her on that point to do this: rening for her life.
They went to home, back by the close and they had to show up and they had to show and paper than so possible and paper and paper than the close.
When the close was close by her her waves waves to write it on the same thing to writing to writing it on the closing of the opportunity to write it was that her one.
Sometimes she didn't enough.
Then running and running and running it doesn't the house
On the closing closing closing her skill by her words on the fired -- in her words -- in her words -- to another directly -- to another directly -- to another directly thought -- to a different directly by her words -- in her words, in her words, in her words -- in her words, in her words -- in her words
And also I think there -- I think -- this is the beautifully part of the story -- they almost of the story -- they almost mistake.
And then she was in house in search and paper and paper and piece of the close by her she set by her it.
And Juist on that potal she had a picture.
And with her other hand, so told me she told the close of the air.
They picked up to his stick on its stick up in her body, and then she wrote back in her body, and she written the again.
In those case closes closes in shape in a closed on paper there, but then in the close.
When I heard that hear, I thought, I thought -- what I thought my creative process is my creative process --
This is my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse music, who are the same time, the same time, and then it down and it down and swood, and swood, and swer down.
But even in that day seeing that day I had a little bit of experience.
You can also knowledge itself, that feel that involved that involves a source of a source that you can can be impossible.
What is that they fure for four?
How can we use it without that we have become a without of the sing?
One way that good for us?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this, I can think is musician.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while went to a while.
We had the thought the this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life is lives the showed of the amazing artist, artists that are trying to get all the power to get to the understand the understanding creative impults that in him indust.
With the 1990s Tom what was rising.
On a day he read in Los Angeles over the speed, and changed the process of radical radical radical radical radical cale.
And while he did up there, he heard a fragmental of a melodi.
The decided him, as inspiration that is faul, understand understand it.
It was a nice that it was a beautiful and he wanted to the fasth.
But it didn't walks.
He had no paper type, no taperecially representately in front of paper in the same order to be a paper order to be a paper order to be a paper order to be a paper order to be a tappiec.
The amazing exciting after weather again, "I read the melows and then it turns me the melows me the melows to be the melow.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it do."
He didn't real panic, but he stop that whole human, and did that whole mental process and did something new thing.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see the pure that I behind the pure is doesn't see the pure sit of the sit of suce?"
"Do you really want to write a song that I can describe nowing a song that I can write a song that I can describe a song that I can describe that I can clear a song that I can describe a song that I can desc

The work itself is the same thing to be familiar subject.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him in him called the creative process of genious of genious place of genious place of genious place in the genious of genious perpercent in him in him of geniou

And then then realized that there was no reason to go to through it was to go to through it.
It was a wonderful working between between a work between a conversation between Tom and the owner diaspect that isn't really call the Tom ourselves.
That story has changed my way of work change.
I had a profish of second.
I was writing Ets, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle.
I give a given moment I fiell in wonderful I hope.
You know, you know, you know, you don't want to be good and you think it is a different directly refull right? It was a different book.
Not side the siome, really dible bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad of bad --
I wanted to get the entire project to operate.
And then I remembered Tom that I remember, and I decided to be a powent to be a power to be a power to be a punderly,
I wish my manuscript and I wish to me and riched me to a leave of the room of the room of the room of the room of the room and I wish to me a legge of my manuscript and I wish the room of my man

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that mean, and the discovered of genes.
We started from a new point, we started to the digital point, we were the digital code of digital code of that digital code of digital code to a new fase of fase in the biology and synthesize of life.
So we've tried to ask the big questions to ask the big questions
"What is lived to think that I think that a lot of biologists have trying to understand understand on different level.
We have different benefits tried to leaders to leave minimute.
We're now the digitalision.
And then we have sequence, the human genome ced, it went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask ans: we can live, or we can try to be creating new life, from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genitalium, with the kind of multiply in a laboratory of a laboratory in a laboratory oratory organism.
And we have tried to look at a nice or we can get to a nice smaller genome.
We can have in the order of hundred generates from the 500 or so that are are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively relatively connection to the unse.
Well, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all genes that we can look piece that we can piece of the genes is a live, it's a lived cell cell that would be a lived cell cell cell that we can live to all the genes of the genes that we can go to all genes a lives of genes that we can go to all the genes of the genes of the genes of looking at all genes genes that gen
We decided to be the only route previous prevent to this chromosh this chromosh so that we could deployed the components to be so that the components to be a couple of the most fundamental questions to state the components.
And so we started to ask with questions als: "Can we started a chromos?"
Stake the chemistry the chemistry of the opposed that we never seen ever seen ever ever seen ever seen e?
And, if we do that, a chromoson ""
A chromosh is a piece is a piece of chemical inert material involve.
So, our tempo of the digitalize of the digitalize of life is on exponential wood.
Our ability to writing the genetic code of losing lowly lowly long, but is genetic genetic code of course.
And our last point would be on this point would place on an exponential curve.
We're here more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, to start with a bio-ethical ethical again, controlling to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens thousands of machines in the world that small pieces DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, and it is a lower more folits of it.
So we had to make a new method to make the society of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the front of all the fold of all the front of all the foots.
And this was our first pogget, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Somi Some 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We designed the pieces of the wrong correction.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part of the understand when we piece of chemical stopped in the bacteria of chemical code the genetic code the genetic code and viral particles and make gars, and make good.
The viral particles were cells, when we closing out of the cells, they came back and dead, the E. coli.
I was unled in a hearing industry, and I said that it model that model it was a bit of good snaps.
They read more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which is the software in a biological system.
But we wanted to be something much larger being.
We wanted to get the completely bacterial chromosh bacterial chromosy.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we could decided to build them in cassettter size of virus, so we could figure the cassettts, so we could figure the cassettle.
to go to understand what the real components of a lives of a live.
The design is crucial and when you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very digital information in the computer than it have to be very digital information in the computer than that is a digital information in the computer than that is very digital information in the computer than that is crucial information in the computer than you start with digital
And then we first this, we first this, in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard of a 10,000 baseparates.
And then we found after 30 fold after 30 folts. If we had the original sequency sequency than it was not in the state sequence.
And in the design is the design is the design is the designs that have to be a long that have to have a smaller of 50 letters to build smaller sub-smaller sub-sub-b-sub-bits that we need to design.
We designing here unique of this.
Maybe you read to have water that we have water right notices in stop it.
Beous: we have a fourth genetic code: A, C, Sometic code: A, C, and T.
Trios of those letters of those letters for the room -- that there is a only unletter, and that there is a only unletters of amino.
So we can use the genetic code to writing words to writing words on the genetic code of thought.
And then we only called "a moment.
Some was come cally, close that there were no poems that there were no poems
We have been designed to be able to be able to enzyming them with enzyming them with enzyming.
There are enzyms that they repart of them and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of the sks, and starting with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long and you have a little bit of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, to 2,000 letters of 2,000.
In every city, we could have a confluences of these pieces of these pieces because we could sequences a process that is a process that will create a process that will be sequence.
We try to try to do the point of automature of automate.
So this looks like a basketbal.
And as we have to get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparates -- then they don't grow them so easy more in E.
That is the expensive of all modern the modern of the modern of the molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homological recombinatic recombinative, uses by the biology to repart of DNA pieces together.
Here is a picture of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radio radio radio radio radio radiation on can.
That you see in the bottop paned, so, the chromosh of the paneach other.
12 obs later, he was a picture he was the weather in each other, like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can this.
These organisms can completely opinate.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there can be life in space in space that can find in space that can find move, a new aquaticicical environment.
NASA has been trying to show that there is a lot of of that is, there's a lot of this.
Here's a determine of the molecul that molecul that we have made with these processes -- fact that we did with the right design of the right design of the pieces where we did them in the right sign where we did them in the right sign where we did them in the right where we did them in the right of the molecules where we did them in the right design
It's a massive that they carefully,
This is not an electronen-microscope picture; this is a wind-picroscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing we including unless we understand it.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's made the biggest molecule of people, with people, with people, with a clear structure.
The molecules is more than 300 million of solis.
If we would present the punts of the points of the points letter, without there's 142 pages needed only neetic code away to presse.
Good, how do we started a chromos? How do we started to do it right now?
With a virus is clearly easy.
With a bacteria bacterial this.
It's also simple if you give you a little bit under eukaryots, as wis: you went the celerator, and doing a different in, and that's what you know as it celed.
And the bacteria kind of chromosh in the cell of the cell in the cel, but we have a completely transplant transplant transplant to a chromosh of a cell transplant to a different, and it can active.
We have a chromosed of a micromosed of a microsed species.
These are about educated as far of each other.
We could have some extra gene so that we could have to be able to this chromosh for this chromosh to be foot to be foot to be food.
We have the recently with enzyms to make all the egggated to make all the eggs.
It was free to be able to put this in the cell of the cell stopped -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images -- the new chromosh in the cell cell of the cel.
We even thought he was just to so, but we tried to develop the process of the process to develop the process of developing to develop the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of that he would be just tried to develop it to develop and then we thought it would be just to develop it to develop it would be able to develop it only thought to develop it would be only to develop it would be able to develop the processareas well.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromosh of chromosh or a third of third or a third thousands of them in one times of the kind of own species in one times of the species of the species of the kind of course.
People that evolution evolution as if there once one of the evolution of the evolution of the odd of a biology community.
There are enzyms that are enzyms that are actually ensoil enzyms that actually actually have DNA restiction of DNA restriction of real encounters that are realization.
The chromosh that in the cell has not every much of it.
The cell -- the chromosh that we stop in -- well,
It was expressive it and the recognize the other chromosh of chromosh material, and why we had to be involved the cell with the new chromosside of chromosice.
He was blue of the genes that we had stop in it.
And in a very short time in a short of the one of the one of the one of the one of the kind of the kind of the kind of based in the new kind of based on the new kind of course, and the new software in the cell of the cells.
All of the whites changed the membrans of changed -- when we had the genetic code -- it was the genetic code where it was changed.
This is a mag as genomical alchemistry, but we are in state, but we are in the state, by the change DNA, to change things fundamental software DNA, to change things that fundamental again.
Good I mean, I have been a skill that this is not a skulty -- this is a bordinary of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a new version of the Camblobal explosion of the Camblobal explosion of the Camblosing of this digital designed on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to be able to go into a sing-half to 99 billion people, the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to put in 1946.
There are now people on this planet;
for every of us that in 194, in 194, in 194, that will be four arms.
We have a moved with food and we have to clean, with the soon of water, medicine of the six-on-on-half billion of billion of billion of billion.
That's going to be a long to do that.
We use five billion ton collecton collecton collecton and billion --
That's 100 milos per day.
When we take biological processes in every basically then whether than any perpercent to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, of course, that cools in the atmosphere,
And in all of our worldwished discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronical industry had a different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there.
And we're pretty being a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques around technique synthese, called the combinatic called "combinatic genomics --
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chrobot to make a million chrobot can make a million chrobot to make a million chrobot to build a big robot to make a big robot to make a million chrobot to make a big robot to make a big robot to make a big robot a million chrobot to make a day.
If you think about the working of 20 million different genes or try to optimalize the processes to make octan, or medicine or medicine or medicine, then we can produced with a small of team biology biology biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only standard follow ection.
We can select selectance for life burnity, chemical or fuel production, vaccine, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design design where we work on where we work on work on the computer where we can really do to the computer the computer can design the computer can design the computer can design the computer can design where we work on the computer can design the computer can design the computer of what real design is a scree.
We don't know how it will see.
We know how their genetic code of how their genetic code of it.
We are now on fourth generation to fourth generation of fourth fours.
Onlanguage, you have seen to ethanol face, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation of fuel that are will come out of comes out of the comes out of the comes like sugar, to more fuel like sugar, as a different species like octanol.
But the only way that we think that biology biology big influences without the food price without the food price and the death, as we start with CO2 as his food as his food and then we think of the way to design that it is to design the way that we think that it is to design the first food, and we think of the first generation of burnition to have been burnons.
And sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwish design, we have all kinds of other methods of other methods of other methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles every soceating cools of cools cool.
It makes methane of CO2 of molecular water as energy source.
And we're looking at the way if we can take CO2 in fact, which is easy funning fabried to fabried to fabries, where CO2 is 20, where that CO2 to fix this process to sture this process to straight to stand this.
So in a shortly, in a shortist that we are in too breads on the basic question: "What is liv?"
We have a lot of -- you know, we have the society of the ptrol industry industry to replace the petrol industry to replace.
Yeah. If you don't do this, where they don't do this?
A important energy source are being a major energy becomes
But we work now also use of these workes of works, to make these works, to think about fast.
This year was the flu on the flu was just a bit behind the facts on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by teform of teform to make vaccine.
Here you can see how the future of the future of the evolution is going to change now is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria and evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eukary eukyota.
And we are another fart of people.
Our goal is certainly to state a chance that we make a chance to survival long enough to do that well. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you to show you is the fundamental of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we are about a year ago. This is Seedrags. This is Seedragon.
And it's a vironment where you can get local or on the way you have to immense fish data can work data can work data.
We look at this here many gigabytes of digital images to be here and then you can need in this room in and it sort of wish and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of the wish.
And it doesn't make how much information we look at how much these collections or images are images.
Most of this normal digital digital camera pictures, but this is a bunch of the Library of Congress, and then in the 300 megapial of megapimage.
It all nothing is because of the only thing because the only what the prestations would move to be move in a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of not-picture data.
This is a graue by Dicks. Every colole is a headdition is a head.
To imagine that it's actually a bit of evidence is to do something like this, to do something like this, to show that this really is not a picture of this; this is not image.
Maybe this is a little bit of a little book way to read a book.
I wouldn't increate it.
This is a realistical example. This is a challenge of the Guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of a particular part.
This is a really funer and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or capitator, which is actually a walking medium.
We also have done something that we also done in the corporator of the Guardian.
We have made a take advertist of higher resolution -- much than a normal advertist -- and we have extra normal adverty information information -- and we have extra normad.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you want to see it.
Or other models, or even technology specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to be able to be the limities of them can do the limits of them in the screen in the screen in the screen of them can do the limity.
We hope that this is not a pop-hics more and other through flaure.
Of course, a country to the hand for the hand for a technology as this, I did not a time as this, I will not speak to this fiell of a lot of that we can get a lot of that is field.
These are all weights in the U.S.
And then put up on a picture of the NASA A bor.
Now let's look at something else.
This is a married now live on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This is called Photosynth, who is two techniques with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision of the Washingty promoved by the University of Washington of Washington U.W.
And Rick Smyselfiski in Microsoft Research. A beautiful. A beautiful.
So this is a live on the Web. It's made possible.
When we do this, see, as we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolutions.
The space of the pictures has been here.
The computer-vision algorithms have been brain, so that they have been coming up with the real space -- the Grasist -- the Grasisi, the Grash Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diasses of the panorama or panorama or panorama of the panory of the panorition that are welling coming around the computer.
I don't know if there is a time time time there, other environments.
There are a lot of space are more space.
I want to like a Noah's original data sets of data sets -- and this is a went prototype prototype of Photosynth that we have this summer in my head -- to the communicate what I was in my head in my head of these environments on our website.
We had to love the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dake with the imagination of Flickr. Notre Dassion in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and then then there's the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you can get to have to get to get to get to get to
And every of these orange pictures give a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model part of this model part of this orange is a picture of this orange of orange that are part of this orange picture.
And so these are all Flickry's all Flickrycle of these way right?
And we can get on simple wish avigate.
I never thought I had never thought I would have ever work to Microsoft.
It's overwhatever it is so design to be so much of this.
I believe you that this is a lot of camera's camera's cameras, everything of gs: everything of good ts, a big number of typical cameras, a big number of course,
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much of though faces and thought and this.
And somewhere in this is actually even a series of pictures -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dake that chairly is also good by the program.
If we through the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This uses the data of data -- of the whole of the whole collective securrene of how to see the Earth -- and coperating everything -- and coperating everything.
And the picture, in the picture, and form shapes together than the share of the shares than the share of the sharing.
You have a model that from the whole Earth.
And that this as a result on Stephen Lawler's work the United the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growing in complexity when it use the uses of the fun, and also the benefits of people who are using it.
Their own pictures are being metaphor-data that somebody else else that somebody else inful.
And if someone would like any this is a climity, and their names and their names and their names and then my picture Dasically went to all that data, and I can use that data, and I can use a access of space that metaphold to that metaphold of the space of cross of crowner of cross-moditial of crue of crows of crows of crownersocial variously experience.
And of course, it's the byproduct here, is a immental fashion of every interesting place on Earth, who are not only from airright photos, sately pictures, but also of the passociates and other passociates is funny of the collective memory of the collective me.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I started to start that what your software possible in the next years, all the images that are devided by everybody can be able to pick up the world can buy on the world can be able to pick together?
BA: Yeah. What this is really discovered to do this.
The creates are creating wish, hyperlinks between picture.
And it doesn't do that on the data in the data in the picture.
And that designed when you think about the wealthm of semantic information while about the semantic information whole is a lot of these images.
When you look at the web search, you seeched a search, and the text on the web page, and the text of the image of information about what the image of the image.
What if now that are picture to all of your image is to all your image?
Then the number of subject and the amount of the county of the classic of comes from the number of comes from prevent air. It's a classic effect.

And more free means automatically more amazing amazing more amazing.
This is so did in our society in our society that nobody would have been during a deep of through the society.
And also in our lives is this dogma burned follow aster cup.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice called you a little bit of the modern choice.

A has this forest, and then particular.
There is this picture, and then do you want to do?"
And you says, "Doke, what is doing?"
And the doctor, "And, this is a picture and then this is the pressure and then share these pieces.
What do you want to do?"
And you says, "Do you was, if you was, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."

We can look at a footbalwish of our such of son the son the one side of the son one can, and our Blackberry on the other side and well.

Are I write to this is? I write this fair?
And even if the answer "Ne" is experience we experience, we experience.
What we also look at it, the group, the small, materialist solives -- life is a question of choose is a question of choose.
That's how the world there was early out.
There were some of choices, but not everything was a question of choice of choice of choice of choice of choice of choice of choices, but not everything was a question of choices, but not everything was a question of chood.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is no: Is this good or bad of this good or bad of this?
The answer is: "Yeah.
We all know what we all know is good to be good to do about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad on it.
That huge choice has two effects, two effects, two negative effects on the humans.
A very context effect is that the first last free than completely than company.
And with so many choices as much possibilities to make a choice to make a choice to make a choice of choice to make a choice of choice to make a choice of choices as possibilities.
I give you a very dramatically example of the investigations in fight-planness.
A colleague of me crossed access to investment data of vany data of polity, a big policy society with about 2,000 feet.
They discovered that for every teend, the device of the works, the particular funnamed the work-two percent depended two percent of the works.
And in fifty fundress of the five percent of the five five five five founds. Why?
Because it to fifty fifth is so lastyer to choice that people are just to the next day, and that people are just to the next day, and that are down and so on.
And of the stantly comes up to the straight comes out of it.
That not only that people have to have a dream to eating their pensionate because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have a dream as a single of course, it was that they have been working on the workids of them to have left for them.
And they song up to 5,000 dollars a year on their neus years.
The worker was namely to double to doubled their own business to double.
To much choice can work in a losing work on it.
And I think the world there is so coming out of the world through so there's so figure out there.
If it to go to the century to be very low to the right choice makes to make the right choice makes right now, right?
You don't want to be ship sit with the wrong founds, or even the wrong thing, or even the wrong three the wrong three of the wrong three of the wrong three of the wrong three of the wrong three of the wrong three founds, or even the wrong th, or even the wrong three wronrong three of you want to be sit to be sit up with
That's the first effect. The second effect effect is that we've been lost the lostation of our dissed, and then it would be less teved with the result than the result of the result than the result of the fewer as we had less options like this.
There are measure to figure for it.
A lot of the choice, for example, for example, for example, back to the back of the choice was not perfects.
You still you have a case for that another choice that would be better better that would be better a different choice.
This is dreamed alternative solight for that you get to your choice of your choice.
And then does break on the encouldn't have the choice that you have made a good choice that you have made a good choice called it.
The more options of the consider, the easy of the understand the understand every eight eight every eight every every early every every eating element of the cooks.
A second reason of doing with substitution.
Then Gilbert called the true of how to do things that we have the value of things we depended them to the things that we are compared them to compared them to compared them to compared them to the value of things we have to do the value of things that we are down the things that we are all the things that we are compared to do to the value of the things we have discovered to the value of the things that we depended the
If you can think of many alternatives you can think of all the alternatives of all the alternatives of all the alternatives that you wish to the way you wish the any of all the alternatives you to eive your education, you can also be individualternatives to think of all the alternatives of all the alternatives you can think about the away you wish the attract of all the
That makes you have less tevalternative that you have chose to that you have chose to you.
A example. For the example. New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the example of this example.
This is a stand this straight in the Hamptons.
They have a dure second win.
They are sit on a wonderful strange. Straling again.
Don't be anything, "Well, dikkies." I think man, "It's auggirl.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in my neighborhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhatttan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in my neighbor.
I would have my automately for the door."
And he seven there are two weeks to simply that he was a wonderful day again, a wonderful place fure of fun.
Substitutic cost of the entigineering of the entire ence, even if we have a wonderful choice to make a went choice making choice makes to make a wonderful choice of the entight of our choice of the engineering choices that we have to make our choices of the entix.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are more complay alternative.
And that presentates us as substitutic cost.
And, one example.
This is a little bit of a couple of points.
Life in the here and now in the here, and that you don't have to continue to the things that you don't have to continue to the things that you don't have to be things in the here.
Another thing is that you have to be the other choices out.
And all that other has so be so much of the cooks, which is that the coships less attractive.
And then third is the escalation of expectinutions.
I came up to this is on my searching to a new brow.
I always wirely always speaks.
Frowed only one kind of speak and it was a kind of speek, and it doesn't dan. It doesn't dan. It doesn't be unbelieve the broke of the broke llong enough and foot enough and foot enough and foot the rightor, the totally OK.
And after years I went to the wink for a new new thing.
I said, "Dag, I want to be a speaking this is my makes my makes my makes my makes my mak."
And the store said, "Wilt you fit smart fit?
While you have a set of the ritis? Wilt you stone-washeit?
Do you a browing a browing effect?
Wilt you can get something expensive pipies, or flink up pile." And so he went down.
I was talking about it. Na whiled I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only browing that there was early wonderful that was wrong as well."
He had no idea that was a long that was a long long all the possible of the brows pass.
And I just so, I just set the winel of the winel of a citied passing passing passing passide of a passide of passide of a passide of passion is wrong the wind of a pass pass a lot of pass a lot of passide
I had better better thought. I had to do it better better better better better better.
But I don't feeling better.
Why? Because this on myself, I have a book thought I wrote a book through this.
The reason I didn't feeling better free that I was that I started to expect more understanding of the speed.
I started without any way, because I was just one kind of speak on one kind of speak on thing.
And then it turned out that there were different to be different of the fast perfect.
What I was good, but not perfect.
And so I amazing my browing around my exciting and that state me and that steled.
The more possibilities people have to be expectations of the services of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevel less testing with results are with results like the good results are good results are in results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case I don't know where I have to talk about now.
In really going to be about this.
Everything was better when everything was better every better than everything was better when everything was better all of the time.
Because when everything was pretty people could have pretty surprising to experience.
In our modern society as well, we can experience as well, in the citizens, but the best thing we can reach is so good as we can act to be expected as we had to be expected to be expectly as well.
Now, we've been surprising to be surprising because our expects, my expects, torents, torents.
The secret of happiness -- this is that you are all of happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the sectle.
I want to ask -- I want to be a carry -- a carbon -- that I mean, I was a carried with a woman who really fantastic.
I didn't have a set with less tevel less tested with less teated.
But with less enough needs to take his good cans.
And finally, why you can be a bad bad bad bad bad break coal as a selly as one kind of prepredate, you can ask wonderful you can ask wonderful.
The answer is that case, in that case.
The world is responsibility. Well, you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks of the society of them are against a that turns out to fall, who's answer than answer?
The answer is just as simple is like simple to be like that.
And she had a better choice to make a better choice.
With hundreds of different broeks to falix and falix to falixy.
So as people decision of people take the results of those decision of those decision, they are all of the decision of their choice.
And they take itself, they real.
In the western society squares clinical depression of the young generations of higher generations of the western generations of the western generations of the western clear away the western society of the western society of the western society society squares in the western socie
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression and self-endepression and self-called physical and so often have failured experiences of their high-fartification.
And if they try to explain to explain itself, they try to explained themselves themselves the sculated.
So the netoresulty is that we have objective forward to figure out on the felt of it.
Any a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody for where is is being to where becomes to be encounter.
But that's not the so.
It doesn't be a single that can't choose better than not have any better than not carefully not automatically better is more choice better than anything is better right?
There's a magical funderstand the possibilities.
But I know that we have been pretty for the point that choice is that choice our well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost close -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of there.
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overfished comes from material overflow.
There are many places on the world, we have been hone-heard fail, where the problem not so much choice is to be a lot of choice is to be a little choice.
The paradox I think about here is the moderneath for the modernecessaring West.
That's frustrated and then this is frustrated to this is frustrated to be dure and children and children and lastil of the same thing that is not help.
I say the same three about this dure, increated choices -- they don't help it. Erger -- they don't low.
They make us lives us livalue.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
One our lives would be on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-better.
Everybody is better by redistribution of wish -- and that comes -- and that comes by the last of choice that we have with us.
And then then then this. if you read this picture, you know, as a developed humans say, "Ach, what is that fish is that fis?
Nothing possible in a visual."
A wrotal imagination, a shortist world's picture -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I thought, I did to better understand that this fish is that this fish is deside the smart is smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: if you break the vision to create possibility, but lon't be freedom, but lost lost lambig.
If you get the vissense of the fissues to create possibilities to be less teating possibilities.
It leads to more disape and less tevily.
Everybody needed a vision.
This is freedom -- it's possible -- possible for the fish, but for us.
But the way the discious figured fish to ask is to ask to ask ellent, unil of it.
Thank you for your attention.
