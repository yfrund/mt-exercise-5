Last year I showed these two slight to show that the pollish cap, that the last three million years of the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States --
But this distributed the arnst of this particular problem because it doesn't the ice of the ice.
The ice capacity on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and cracks in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a accelerated version of what happened in the last 25 years of the last 25 years of the last 25 years happened in the last 25 years of the last did did did slide of what happened in the last did slide.
The permanences is dived in red.
As you can see, it looks at dark blue.
That's the year-old ice ice ice during the winter.
And the cracks in the summer.
The so-called permanent, or age five years or old is almost like blood, that from the body here.
In 25 years is the from this to this in this go.
And that's a problem because the frozen flowing around the Northern Icelebrate and there's a very big heat, and there is a very big amount of carbon cool carbon is cool in methane, when it was designed by microbecoming up in methane.
And the total high-lowing amount of the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, it could double, if we could double, if we could double.
In some undeep in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another undeep to another undeep of the University of the University went to another undeep of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the Universe.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is better or we will be that are.
A reason for that, is that this huge "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a smelt aterriver.
The water than ever the water than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussua's sua's sua's South South South South South South South South South South South South South west-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea left of the sea legal because the landical melt, then this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These are taking flocks to take it.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
Some month, in the last month, scientists that the whole continent, now is a negative ice balance.
Meer specifically is the ice in the westing of the South Pole very quickly quickly in the global disticate, with some of the needs.
The whole continent, the whole continent, like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after biggest ice mass, there are new now, that were now going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the world's population of that smelt time.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more streams.
But when they disappeared, it also the drinking water.
In California was there a fairly 40 percent in the snow.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read it, are the predictions of it.
This world has led to a dramatic type of forests fired fired burn.
And the number of natural of natural and never never seeing a courage and never never see.
Four more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years of the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely intly.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years of CO2 we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours.
Twot-five mixed in our oceans, Kean, look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean America, from America, and in every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a dragin, there's a dragin, there's a drag-sty-hydrogen in the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, next to the Earth, next to 20 percent of the earth, is burning fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and cool is the all greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extinct with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more citical centers.
But we see a course.
These are the voices that the steissues that the building was in the last years, in the last years, where green alternatives were fored.
There's a political battle on the corn.
The voice carbon and oil industrial gave 250 million dollars to promots, which is a clear clean, which is a counter.
And that image to me.
And the chart was in me, at me at home in Tennessee, about four billion liter country to citute.
You probably have seen the news.
This is the one after the biggest of the biggest directly in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertenties of the urban round the Korst was the Kurst was the one.
Video: ""Frosty the Shen-coolman is a blice, up.
He is overflowing in America, and he makes us in America, and he makes our economics.
Frosty the voice carbon the day clean.
He is paid and cutty and cutty and called their job."
Here's a big part of the urban part of the urban in West Virginia coul.
The biggest mes, the bigger of the country is the big bah.
Video: Don Blankship -- "Let me clear. Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reme, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigns on touch.
This is a piece of this.
Video COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious as a serious threatence for our things.
That's why the reason why the most important goal is to give a giant to a giant for a giant to the light and the practical for lightly and the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of
Fit is, stepped is not smart.
We find that it's clean -- and it clean -- and it clean.
So, you don't make climate change.
Let me just that you know, to us about it.
Video: Acuritic: Schone carbon a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cities clean core countral.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of a lot of law.
But that's the sound of smooth.
Deancing the fact that the fact that the burning of the early important causes of the Earth, change the earth, change the remarkable cities that you see here.
Look at right around the clean urbank technology today.
Al Gore: Einthis: Please alternative alternative to our economic challenges and that at the area of national security.
Video: America is in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire of all these things are our dependence, our dependence, like pole fuels, like pole colls, like pole and inmported oil.
But now there's a durful, new solution to this.
And in 100 percent clean electricity, in 100 percent clean electricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to work America to work that safer us to make a section that makes us safer and the warming.
And eventually a solution that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America.
Al Gore: And the latat.
Video: It's about America. It's about America.
And one of the fastest ways to make a sense of old to our dependence of old own the fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sin, a new energy system.
Man investments to create good investments to create good jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African talked about that says, "If you want to be a quickly.
If you want to go to and get together."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with an update about how that works.
So here I am here. For those who were not going to be the LHC is the biggest scientists in the correct experiment ever in the cump of course, 27 miles in the cump of the course,
It needs to the circumstances that were less than a billion a billion of second after the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, this!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took photographs of that mini-Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in diameter -- 44 meters in diame.
Spectacular photo of ATLAS in continuous so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photo become taken by ATLAS.
That was crated for a partystemed in the controlled room.
It's a photo of the first particle particle that are all around the LHC in and with the LHC with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, through particles in the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we knew that photo 10 September 10 September we knew that the machine working, which is a huge overwhat's a huge overwinning.
I don't know if this is the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of this, when somebody was going to Google and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have a sboth a cultural as a scientistic impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these gold.
And those days ago, 13 thousand amper refull currents.
The engineers are going to say, "Not where. It's too small wear."
They can do that because they can do that because they can be superceived on all temperaturs.
So at the multiple between the space between the stars, who can have been able to do that stream that stream celebrate.
In one of the constructions between the neine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructivate.
And then that was the wire of the wirmer, and it was a little bit of electric resistance that 13 thousand amper that 13 thousand amper high.
This was the result.
This is another inpression when you realizing that those magnets more than 20 tons of the ton away and they were about 30 centimeters.
We have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them out of it, what we did.
We all have them all tool.
Now, they are back to away.
Eind the LHC will be intact.
We will be able to put him again, and we expect in June or junny June -- so that we can go to the build of the universe.
Now, of course, they have increase the debate of scienced the value of scientist. It's easy to work about the value.
I think it's so hard that it's so hard to be so hard to go beyond beyond beyond things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was disaped in the words of the valuable experiments of his teachers of his teachers -- his learning was Michael Farday, this said, "Nothing is so dangergerous than the subject of the human beings than to take our images of human mind that our images are completely indicultive, that our being completely designed in the world that we are newnon't completely that our being our news in the pultivately definities of the works of the neevates --
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your children, when you play with blocks playing with blocks playing with blocks of it.
And then you discovered how to go to the grain and award, they were basically and awareness and awareness by the simply of space with and depenter of space relationships.
Rumble insight is a strong because with the world to understand us.
If an information -- in an inspired by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advises with my advision -- I started to ask Jeee Kalanithi -- what if we were using a computer -- what if we were using a computer informed in a mical finger as a kind of digital fingers that information mosing information that we can put in a place of information that information with a place countries that information that we can information that information that information that information that information of information that we can pace cous information of information movital fulate information that moastact sofficitation in a movitation of information of information of information of information of fulation
and orders can we have to lim?
This question of us so concerned us so to search a answer to search a building of Siftables.
Shortly is a Sift-hate is an interactive computer size of a cookie.
They can be moving with the hand they can be able to feel another than they can feel each other and they detect a screen and they put a screen and contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical accustomercisions, they can be moved by it.
Bovendis are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And so that these tools have a more physical different physical different of their movement and even of the way we have movement and even of the way we move them movement, there are different new and likes of the way we are like.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift: This Sift-inated to show a video -- that is playing to play and others and others and otherwise.
These interactive portraits of each other --
And indicated each other to each other for each other for each other to each other to each other to each other for each other to each other for each other to each other to each other to each other to each other to each other to each other to each other to each other than that.
And if they are covering them to be surrounded this and what nervous.
And they feel they feel and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interesting consequences of the interesting of everyday and it was a color if it was a color if it was a color if it was a liquid --
In this example three Siftables of emmers and I can use them to make them to be color in a leg in a leg of the course, where they are human.
And if we have dreviewed what we save back.
There are some capable to see some capabilities for education, made by the education, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to try to try and the result of the result of seeing inside of the result of seeing and the result of the education.
Here I show you -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci of a simple county showing programmmatic realculating programmmatic of a fix.
Here we show you a game that a cross between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a randomy of every Siftable, and dangered words are controlled in a dictionary dictionary in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds being about 30 seconds it is a new series of letters with next to letters with next possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some of children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in in in the Media Lab, and I was trying to make it and make a video of it.
They were really again,
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need nearly not need instructions that people need nearly need.
Everything you have to say "Make word." And they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people to test the other people at test --
That's our young base tester, right-tester, right?
And it seems that he just seems the Siftable.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting here.
We wanted to learn a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can caraker in the scene of the scene with that characters with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun comes up here.
Video: The sun is coming up there.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene brain.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done! Yeah!
And by shift Siftables and the next to each other places to each other -- and it can let the characters with each other -- -- "Weh!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decision.
Video: The catch.
DM: The last example that I will show you a synthesizer and live music to be a synthesizer and live music that we have each Siftables and drum.
Enybody has been four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use you.
These sounds can be injected in leg Siftable, so you can defined the pattern itself.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the atternal Sift-filter live controlled live controlled of a reverble effects like reverbal and filter.
They are addred to a sound and addred by cancers.
And then before the general effects like tempo and volume that are patternited on the entire pattern.
Let's look at the time.
Video: DM: We're starting with a leaving in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a showed by an extra like.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: DM: Now I feel what slow.
Video: And now I couldn't get the filter to the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can accelerate the cancer of the cancers of the block.
Video: Now I buy the filter of the basaxis for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reard the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to do everything to plann, but I can improvise it very longer and shorter longer and shorter like I want.
And then finally the dims of the dims of the volume Sift to the volume to left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make new people, my passion of new people, that are better interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and works.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area with some possibilities that we are in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the touch to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, that information to our world like we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to talk to you all with you with you.
I'm writing.
Books write is my work, but also much more than that.
My whole life long I'm already to write and I don't think that it will change that it will change it.
And yet there's a long thing in my life and career, and career, and career, and I had my relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my life.
And it started with a book that I had written unning a memoire, "Eten, Biddle -- Bich," that very close to my first work and a international existing and an international existing and an international exist.
The consequences me anywhere I have to do is called me and always at all.
And what -- you know, does -- gott!
People come to me and ask me and ask me to ask me and ask you to me, "Don't you never bang you can equalive.
Don't you afafraid you will keep your entire life writing but never set any more than people will be walk for warm where people will be heatt?
Don't you afafafafafafraid that?"
Ery touched up.
Of course, that would be very much -- I remember that I was 20 years ago, I was a teenager, if I told that I wanted to be a teenad.
People said, "Don't you afafraid you never get success of success.
Don't you afafraid for it to be subjected to it.
Don't you afafraid you don't have your life to this work without that there is something from the broken and that you're going to diever dreams on the puin of your broken ditters of broken ditternal ax?"
Something in that stribut.
In the shortly comes to this questions that questions questions -- "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afafafafraid for all those things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called things that are called me.
Always the way down.
But I'm also much other things that you don't know that you want to know that all of the things that are all of it.
For seeing seagain, and other end, and other end,
But what is concerned I ask myself the last time that that are fear of the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is the logical that somebody is eight afafraid to be the work for the work for the work for the work of work for the work of the Earth?
And what is so except to creative processes that we make us to make us to make the effects on the mind of the minds, something that in the other species.
Take my father. He was shift to engineer, and I can't remember that there was a little 40 years that he has been working on him to him that has been in the way to him for him to him that he didn't have a bany for it.
And so said, "John, how is it with your chemistry blocks?"
No, not work about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been not the reputation of the eterns are not the reputation of the reputation of manicalcoholists.
And so, the chroom, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have happened to be the reputation mental instability to be instability.
Look at the grims doing the grimmic dotors of the most magnificant creative spirits of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by their own own to do it.
And even those who are not suicide no suicide to be suicide to be concerned to be concerned to be concerned to be suicide to be suicide of suicide --
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty to say about your life work.
But of this kind of a charges we don't look at any more.
We all heard and we heard and have it with such a honort of accepted and it has accepted it all before.
The shaped thought is that creativity is that creativity is increased with suffering and that a artist, and that a artist, and that an artist.
So I want to ask everybody here today, you can you with that idea life?
Do you have that OK?
Because I think about it right now, I think about the right-thought of the way --
I find it refright.
And also another dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century this century.
We can creative sportly better to live better to live in.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark thought of the dark of life.
Sean, the fase that my careers now in which my career.
Go only after: I'm young, amper to a year.
I can work in the last four decades.
Heypopower is going to be seen now is going to be seen, if the world that work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends here with friends up here, so I can slap you know, higher my biggest succcess behind me.
Jem, what a idea!
If you go think, if you are so about the morning to the morning to need in the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work that I love to work where I love to the work that I love to the work that I love with the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love hold to the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love.
The question is, "Do "Hoov?"
After long after long after I can only get to the conclusion when I building a psychological protection in the process inbuilding inside the process inside of the process inbuilding inside the process inbuilding in.
I have to do the write of creating a safe distance between myself and my overigns very understanding for the reactions on my future.
I have been looking at the last year, I was looking at ways to do.
I have in the history of history and have a little bit of other societies to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest has been braved to me broad at the old Greeks and Romeins.
And so, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old of the old Greeks and Roman and Romein's not believed that creativity was itself.
Men believed that creativity was a good mind, that was a dive, unknowledge place to the human being to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these these minds of creativity called "demonen."
And salk Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon wise words influence.
The Romeins had a kind of a similar idea.
And in the called him called creative mind creative mind a "genius."
The funny is that the Roman is that the Roman is not a particular piently incuts.
In their promise was a genius, a genius, a geniused in the walls of the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
And if the artist, the artist, the genius,
He was the working of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work.
The artist was so in protect to be so much narcism.
If you were working on the work of you, you won't get all the every ear.
Everybody knew that is an invisible genius,
Well, you know, you work out of the work of you.
Everybody knew you have, you know, a pretty independent.
Long time is that had been in the Westn creativity was considered to be created to be created to be
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual human beings is the tools of the universe and mysterious and mysteries.
No room for mystical beings, attacked out of the goddle world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came from the individual came from the individual cuts.
And for the first time in history was in history of artists said that they were not that they were a genius.
I need to say that I have a big faker I find that a big faker wrong faul.
And to single one person, one person, one person, one individual that he or she or she or she or she or she or she or she or she or she known for the equal mystery, of everything is -- that is to many much a lot of fragile human psyche.
If you take someone ask the sun in sun clear.
Egos are blowing up to huge huge proportions and there are unimagine including presents of expectations of express express express exploited to express and there's a lot of expectations and there are unimagine to be blocks.
And I think this pressures the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we understand back to an older the relationship between the relationship between the relationship mysterious mysterious called the relationship of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the ancient understanding of the relationship between the relations
Maybe not.
Wellight we can have 500 years rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
Probably seat, in the audience of the public people who have been talking about the idea that evidence that early have the idea that earner of the work of artists to inspiring high-higher the work of artists to inspirate.
It doesn't seem to be able to get you all in that.
I mean, I wonder it out.
Why not?
Why should we have that thought that thought that thought to next?
And the fast, the same thing as much as any other explanations of the total craziliability that decided that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who has try to create something that has try to create -- so in fact, so in fact, this -- you know, the creative process -- you know, that the creative process of the creative process of the creative process --
That sometimes it sometimes to feel that feel like to feel that feel like that.
I have the great American closer Ruth Stone meet Ruth Stone meet meet --
She is in the next. Her whole life writes they close.
She told me about her jeught on the platountry of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field of work, she was close to the country.
And it was, so she said, also, if there was a big wave air,
And so you know, poem wave than the country to her her.
She felt that the ground, she was started to shake her feeling that her on that moment to do that moment -- and she was that only one thing to do for her life.
And she had to go home, backward by the poemms and she had to see so quickly possible and paper and paper and paper and paper to paper and paper and paper and paper to showing home, and they had to see paper and paper than so quickly to see the house.
And when the poemmber was that her only her enables to write it was her only to write it on the writing to write it on the show.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
And then then ring and ring and ring and ring not.
And in the same moments close of sot by her her her -- in her search -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her head.
And also there were a bit -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were poemmistake.
And then she was in home looking for and paper and paper and poets the poemp by her her it.
Juist that moment she had a pencounter.
And with her other hand, she was so told me she pluck the poem from the air.
And she packed the poem at his drive, and pulling it back in her body, while she written the again.
In those cases came the poem close of paper in summits -- but then in the case of paper --
And when I heard that heard -- what I was happening, so the way my creative process of creative process --
And so my creative process isn't work! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mile, who are every day on the same time, and sweating the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and trans.
But even in that day that day I had a question: I had an experience.
You know, you're going to know the self, that sense that feeling that sense that you can identify that you can identify impossible that you can identify impossible that you can identify that you can identify it impossible that you can identify that you can identify it in your bron couldn't identify it to identify it you
What is that source?
How can we use the without that we can use it?
One way that we have good for us?
The best contemporaine that I can think I can think I is musicians musician.
A few years ago, I was interviewed him for a magazine.
We had the this.
And in fact, in fact, a big part of his life life has been showed to the showed of the amazing artists that has trying to get on the uncontinue to the unity.
And the years was the 1990s the years,
And one day he was in Los Angeles about the fast, and the process of radical.
And as he was so true, he heard a fragmental of a melodia.
The decided him, like inspiration that is doing, unground, unground.
It was a nice nice beautiful and he wanted to be the hold hold of the hold beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beau
But it wasn't that you.
He didn't had a paper -- no paper to them.
The well-famous exciting exciting the exciting of him -- "I recoming the melody is going to be equivalent to me euish.
I'm not good enough, I can't it."
He didn't real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sature and I was doing the wall?"
"Do you really think I can write a song of the song of the right now?
If you really want that this song is there, you must be later, if I have a class for you.
Now, you know, somebody else else else.
Go neighborhoods to Leonard Cohent." And then that moment was very different.
The work itself is the same, with the same down at the same time.
But the heavy of the creative process that the creative process in him crace called the creations of the genius.
The genius, the genion of the skin and liver the skin and liver the country and close it just elling up to the skin and close to the skin and liver the skin and close to the skin and close to the skin and close him on
And then to realized that there was no reason to it.
It also could be a wonderful, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own aspect that wasn't quito at all.
That's my story has changed.
I've been a little bit of it.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddle -- Biddle in the middle of Eten,
And I think of a given moment I in spot.
You know, you are that you going to work -- you don't want to be a good and you think it becomes a horrible disast. The book is ever being a high.
Not solid bad of bad -- really horrible bad of bad bad bad of bad --
I wanted to do the whole project all the project of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that said to his genius, and I decided to be a point to be a point to be a point to be a point.
I wish my manuscrips and I was a lot of my manuscritics and I was a legal corner of the room of the room.
And I said hards: "Listen this, we know everybody is not just brilliant -- then that not only through me.
You can see that I have in the state,
I can't give you a mean.
If you find that it can be better you, you must do that.
Do you don't have that? Do you don't know that, understanding you.
I just write down, because that's a my work.
Oh, and in the notular nots. And in the noty is just a difference."
Tja--- United -- United it here --
Euws ago, in the Northern African desert African desert people together to dance in the North African desert music.
And then hours and hours and hours to the morning,
That was great, because the dancers were completely --
But sometime, very sottype of something that happened in a particular this.
And one of those dancers became than transcendent.
You know, you also know what I mean, you know, you also have ever seen you in a performer.
It was like the time still and the dance of the time.
He didn't, anything else than the thousands of next together.
And suddenly he didn't seemed to be a human being.
In him, under him, under him --
A lot of fired hour-hour.
If something like this, if you did a little bit happened to be Dan people what it was Dan them to close and in the core and call cally, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, G
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical facts. And then the Moren Span, the Moren Span, they were broken them this simply with it.
The question is being the centuries, the equal of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, OK, other."
That hort today in the day in the day of fights and flamengodances.
If an artist, in Spanine something impossible or magical does, "Allah, OK, OK, OK, ay, brow."
One of the understandard, souldn't
Precipies what we need to have to do need it.
Lastig is that the dance that the next morning, the next morning, he discovered that he did at the morning of the morning of the morning,
And at that time, he has a little bit of an older man with depends that may never before never before never before will be able to such high.
Maybe never going to be anybody in the calls of his dances are dance.
What should he save with the rest of his lives?
That's hard.
That's really hard to show to show for a creative mind.
But so painful hold it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be the needle.
Imagine that you don't get out of the most unusual aspects of your person aspects of yourself.
Imagine that you believe that you have a which, you know, a long-to-specify to bron.
And when you're ready ready ready ready closing on somebody else.
And so it produces everything.
I highly inside that thought that thought that thought to be thought.
The last months I've been working on a book that inside that is going to get inside of the book that much that much a lot of that is going to be in a lot of that is looking at a time.
The upon that illuster progress progression.
And if my thought to me the hold me to the hold me, I don't like the same for, and I don't know that ance.
Do you just work.
Bline, just just your thing, whatever it is.
If you task you, dancing you to do that.
If the godary genius, that if you is that you are in your work at enyway, in your work at the enything of the wonderful source by lat, "Ol.
Don't happens -- then, thank you very much it down.
And also then, "OK!"
I think that I think I think that is the heart.
"Ole any!" how it because we are like, because we are basically including the wisdom of wisdom and right?
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: OK!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discoveres new sets of sets sets of genes.
We actually start to go from a new point, we were trying to the digital codes digitalize the digital code, and now we try to go from that digital coded to a new phases in the biology of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living -- is something that I think that I think is something that I think is to understand on different levels on different level.
We have tried different approached different approach, the back to minimal components.
We're now the nearly 20 years of the digitalize of digitalize it.
And when we have sequenced the human genome sequenced, it was from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we are trying to ask life -- we can create live, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallst genome for a species, that can mulate multiply in a laboratorium.
And we have tried to look if we can get to a nice smaller genome.
We can invent in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so that are there are.
But if we look at the metabolical card, is that relatively simple to the metable.
Gelebrate me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can exploited a living, is very unlikely that this would be a lived cell that this would be a lived cell cell that this would be a living.
We decided that the only route forward to ask this chromosphere, to synthetic so that we could have the components to be so that we could make the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as well, "Can we are we going to start a chromosome synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic sy
Do the chemistry chemistry the chemistry of this very big molecules that we never see?
And, if we do that, a chromosome of the chromosphere?
A chromosome of chromosome of chemical iners --
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelerating on exponential way.
Our capability to write the genetic coded to write the genetic code.
And our last point would it be at this moment would places at an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some of couldn't start to start with a bio-ethical ethical corned to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little DNA, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it more than it.
So we had to do a new method for the society of these little pieces and corning all pieces and corning all the corners.
And this was our first attempting with the digital information of the genome Phi X174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, did the foltcorrectly.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting particular particles when we piece a piece of chemical stopts, and the bacteria closing the genetic code, and viral particles make the genetic code.
The viral particles were solved in the cells, they were showing back and death, they were killed the E.
I was including in the oil industry, and I said that she was that model just to do that model just too good quickly.
They laughts more than you.
And so we think this is a situation in which the software own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the ential chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes in cassetts, so that we could have the cassetttes of viruses, so that we could be varians.
to understand what the work is to understand what the work components of a living cell cell --
The design is critical information in the computer than that has to be very digital information in the computer than that has to be very accurave.
And when we first came to the first time this genome called the standard in 1995 was the standard per 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we were able to resequencing after 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence. And if we had used to start.
And the design of the design is the design is that they can be 50 letters long that have to overlap with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so they can design so they can be designed so they can design so they can design so they can be able to design.
We designs in the cornal parts of the course.
Maybe you may have read to the water notices.
And this: we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, Goff, Gobviously God.
Trios of those letters are codes for back 20 aminozers -- that there is a long attack for each aminozure.
So we can use the genetic codes to write words to write words --
And in the called the called the member.
Some of course, were counters that there were no poems were not a poets.
We have these pieces that we can eat them in the sks.
There are enzyms that they repaid.
And we started to make pieces that were starting with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, passed each other and you've got pieces of 24,000 letter, until 72,00.
In each stages we could have a confidence of these pieces so that we could sequences to sequences because we want to create a process that is very robuless -- that you will be seeing you.
We try to act the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of the basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of a basketball of this looks like a basketball of a bas
Once we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
That's the expensive of all modern the modern of modern modern biology.
So we went to be able to touch other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologists called "homology to repain by the biology to repairs to repairs together.
Here's a example of this.
There's an organism called Deinococococococococcus radio million radio radio radio to radio radio to be race.
And you see that in the upper panel, sings chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of each other.
12 hours later 12 hours later he was in each other, like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely opened up.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolute certainly that there can be life in space that can find movement, that can find a new aquatical environment.
NASA has marries showing that there, there's a lot of this, there.
Here's a real micropphone of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually used to these processes -- actually using with the right design of the right design of the pieces that we did them in the skills that we did.
Gist makes that they are automatically conference.
This is not an electronen-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a seconds.
This is the publish, that we are including included.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuulges is more than 300 million.
If we should be the pressure, with a 10-points letter, without spations -- it's only 142 pages, only to pressure.
Well, how do we start a chromospher? How do we activate it? How do we activate?
And in a virus is the clearly clear.
And this is a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpleer if you give you under eukaryots, like us, you just the cell of it and doing a different in, and that's what you know if you knew what you know if it clone.
And in the bacteria species of the chromosome of the cell integrated in the cell -- but we have a complete transplantation of a chromosome of the chromosome of the cell to another, and it can activate a different,
We have a chromosphere, we have a chromosphered of a microbs.
These are about so far of each other as people and micked like people and mice.
We figured some extra little extra little extra for this chromosome of the chromosphere.
We have the referenzymes to make any every piece.
It was quite sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced -- and you will be the very advanced -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of chromosome --
And we thought he would come to show that he would come to show the process of the process of developing that process to develop.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of kinds of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of them, which they are thousands of propertied in one times of the species.
People who have evolution evolution equal as if there are one of the similar changes that have changed not much biology community of the same time.
There are enzyms who are enzyms that are actually called DNA.
The chromosome that in the cell has not ever ever ear.
The cell -- the chromosphere, the chromosphere.
It was expressive, and the other chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the other chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell of chromosome of the cell of chromosphere.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappearing all the characteristics of the characteristics of the new species, and he changed on the new species, and he had in the cell of the new software that we had stopped in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new species,
All the eggglaters -- when we had changed the genetic code, it was the exactly in the genetic coded was changed.
This may sounds like genomical alchemist, but we're in in in state, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental --
Oh, I've been paid before that this is not a creation, this is a breakthrough at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I have a half billion years evolution, and I have been paid to be nearly a new kind of the Camble of distance, based on this digital designs on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's quite the free clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to get in six and a half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To place it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us that in 1940 years, in 1940 years that will be there are four in 1940 years.
We have a transporing food, with food, with clean water, drugs, fuel, fuel, fuel, basically a billion.
That's being difficult to do that.
We use five billion ton colls, more than 30 billion five oil.
That's 100 milos a day.
And when we take biological processes in eyshift than any process to replace that we have a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge.
And then of course, there's all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere that carbon dioxide of that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is coming in the atmomosphere in the atmosphere
And though our worldwide, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if the design components for the future.
The electronics had a dozen a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that has been coming.
We are made by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques to do technique synthesize that called combinations to do combinative genomics."
We've got the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a a day.
If you think about the work of 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes to make octan, or trying to make octan, new vaccines, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years.
And it's only standard of the fault of the aware of standard
We can select select for life vatability, chemical or fuel, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design is what real design is that you can really go to work on the corn, and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer can design a new kind of the computer of the computer design of the computer design.
We don't know what it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We are now on fourth generation.
And you know, nonce you have seen to ethanol you can see a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation and third generation that will come in, like sugar, as sugar, to more higher fuels like octan.
But the only way we think that biology that biology without the food price without the food price higher and the available of the availability to get the first food, and that's why we are cells that we have the first food, and we think that we are the first fixing generation, and we think that we are the first cell fixing in, including the first cells inside of the first cells.
Sulight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our global discovered -- we have all sorts of other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea -- about 2.5 miles deep, in the same deep, in coin,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the way if we can take CO2 we can be able to pipe in fability to be able to put in the fabries, where that CO2 becomes back to fuel, to fuel, to fuel, to sture this process.
So in a short time, we think we are in a short of the basic question on on the basic question: What is life?"
We have a realized -- you know, the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- what?
A major energy source become.
But we also are now to use these tools to use these tools to be fasted to be fast.
This year, the flu was the flu -- we walk in the facts of the facts like the facts of the right vaccin.
I think that can change by combined vaccinated vaccines.
Here you see how the future can see the future of evolution that the evolution is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria, archeaas, archeath, archaea, archaea, and eventually eventually changed evolution with synthetic bacteria,
We're still away from the improved people.
Our goal is certainly to survive that we make a chance long enough to survival to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that.
What I want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we are in a new technology that we are at a confidence to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can get local or on the immense of visual data can work on the dishes of visual data to work.
We look at here many gigabyts, and can keep here to have a lot of the room in and extraordinary and the sort of course, and the sort of the course.
And it doesn't matter how much information, how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixal camera --
It makes not all of the only thing that would be influence, on a thing, on a thing, on a thing, on a thing, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book a book of non-picture.
This is the graute by Dickens. Each collect is a chapter.
To evidence that it's really true, and no imagination, we cannot do something like that, to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a little book way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't couldn't have it invite.
This is a realistic. This is a realistic. This is an example.
Each big picture is the beginning of a subject.
This is the pleasure and the experience of a real paper magazine magazine or krant, which is actually a scaling medium.
We also have done something that we did something that is the corner of the Guardian.
We have a next advertising a next of higher than a normal advertisistention -- and we have extra information information.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car you see the here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the constrains of accumble in the screen of across the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more means and other thing, flaure.
Of course, country to the hand lies are a before for a technology like this, I will not spend a time that we can spend a lot of this field that we can also much a lot of this,
These are all the weights in the U.S.
And then put on top on the top,
Let's look at something else.
This is a marries now live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other two techniques --
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision from Noah Snah, promove to the University of Washington, increases by Seitz University by Seitz U.W.
And Rick Smyseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaborate.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
And when we do this, you know, we see this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution resolutions.
The room of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images to be breaded with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are every ither than panorama panorama panorama of these things are panorama panorama is basically increase.
I don't know sure or there's time there, other environments.
There are much more space there.
I want to show one of Noah's original data sets -- and this is one of the early prototype of Photosynthesize this summer -- to the communicate of the communicate of the communicate of this technique, in my head of the work of the environments on our website.
We had to have to do the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dase with images from Flickr. You search on Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and like that.
And each of these orange chain the last every single of this model of model.
And so this are all Flickr images, who are in this way.
And we can simple on simple wise navigate in.
I never thought I had never thought I would ever work at Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is so much to be so much about this as a this.
I think you can see that these many type types cameras are cameras to mirroras, a big number of them, a big number of them,
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much in fact, and so much through faces and simply through faces and like that.
And there's a series of this, even a series of photos -- here are here -- here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dasassociated by the program.
If we put it in a dive, in a physical image of this environment.
And what we want to say is that we can really do is that we can really do with the social environment. This uses the data of everybody -- of the entire collective memory of the obvious -- and buy that everything about each other.
All these photos are being each other and form a very larger than the same than the same thing than the same of the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth.
And so, this is a confused to Stephen Lawler's work on Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses in complexity when it uses to the benefits for the people who using using it.
Their own photos are being subject of metaphor.
If somebody would want to click and their names and their names and their names in the Notre Deadicates with all of those data, and I can use that data, and I can use if you can use a access to that space, used to that metaphold of everybody, and creating a kind of crossling of cross-modal, and creating a kind of cross-modal, and creator.
And of course, is the axual product of this immense rich rich fitual model of every interesting place on Earth, who don't just from the air, who are not only from the collectivates and other applicative and other applicative memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I started to do that what your software possible to a day, in the next years, in the next years, all of the images that can be particularly buy on the world can buy together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering.
The creates to your wishyperlinks between images.
And the base of the data in the images.
And that is being excited exciting when you think about the richness of semantic information that is a lot of these images.
And when you look for the web looks for the web and you can see a search of the web, and the text on the webpage, and the text on the webpage, and the text of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image, you know, the picture, and the text on the web, and the text of the web.
What if you care of that picture, you know, either image?
And then the number of the number of the number of the amount of the amount of the number of the continue of the classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredibly incredible.
One of the intense pleasure and of eating edition is the possibility to live between them, the possibility to them in the wind, who are not forget their past, the presently in the wind, the profitter, the profound in bloaders.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still still the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inuit-old myths of Invents, or that in the Himalaya bood-hundred bood-hunt on the bood-bood's bood-up in the breath, the world in which is not like, the world in which we live in a absolute several setop, but is a model of the world in order of the world in which is a model of the working of the worworld in the worworld in equal of the way of the world in which we capabsolute se.
And the consequences of a set of course, that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all share the same applicate: Worners are born. Brents in the world.
We all make increase down in.
And I go with the individed of the individed by the dead.
So it can't be surprise that we are sings, dances and art art and art them.
But interesting is the unique cadance of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or that now is to the Penan in the walking on Borneo, or the Voo-acolia -- or the See of the Saisut-business in North Kenya, the Caraisut-basically in the Andes-bargating or the Caravantage in the Saharan Anthross the Saharan instant, a month, a math, a month ake, or now in the homolangma,
Everest, the godin-in-mother.
They are all learning us all different, differently, differently, differently.
If you think about it, this idea can only give you a lot of this.
And shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her net and for her just as biological life.
This cultural life-web you can imagine your eating as an eeating edition as an edition as an eeating show.
The eath fact that you can defines the total of all the seat, dreams, mything, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, inspirations that are intuitions that are intuitions are the beginning of our consciousness.
The eath is the big nalatency of humanity.
She is the symbol of all that we are can be that we can be able to be amazing news amazing news to be animal.
like the biosphere is slide in order is the eate, is the eath fact that eyet -- and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would be able to be that at least half of all species on the point of all species on the point of extinct because that simply is not true.
And right? The most apocalyptic scenario comes in the neighborhood comes in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this.
And then everybody here are born born of the souldn't have been sesdual.
A language is more than her words, or her grammmatic rules.
A language is a cutting of human sould.
It's the ferty that the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is an equality of mind mind a disingle, a disingle, a ecosystem of an ecosystem of spiritual possibility.
And from that six, of the six, today is not a lot of the day of that kids doesn't have kids fluence.
They are not longer to be a longer longer
Effective means that they have change a change that they have change, that they have been been death to be already in the world.
Is there something that is a little bit of the childhood by stilled by stilled to be your people, not to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the kids of the kids of the kids of the children teaching of the kids of the children.
Pified that terribs is somebody's class every two weeks and every two weeks and with him with him and with him with him the last last last last last last last last last last last last last late of an old language --
Some of you say, "Wouldn't have better the world if we all should be the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantonees. Or Kantonees.
Or Kogi." you will be able to talk about how it should not be able to talk about your own language.
So what I want to do is take you today is taking you on a short journey by the eating noshot that has to sketched a picture of what is lost in fact,
Many of us forget that when I talk about "another way of being a different way of being a different way of ways that I mean, I really mean.
Take this Barasana child in the North Amazon in the North Amazon the anaconda, that believes that she was from the sky crivial cryed in the eyage of sacross sacross sacross sacles.
This is a top, that cognitive the color blue and not undistinct because the wonderful standard of the skulls of the equal standard of the equal course.
They have a crack of language of marriage, which is called linguistic exoguists called somebody who are a different language that speak a different language.
This has his roots in the mythological past but the particular entirely full in their homes, where six or seven talks about seven tals, but you never have a language hearing highs.
They simply simply and start talking about and then
One of the fascinated tribes that I have read with which I had lived the Waorani in North East-Ecuadorani in 1958 perfective contacts.
In 1957 five missionarive of contact, but they made a critical phancistic.
And the air of the air they were photos of themselves with himself to our idea's idea's idea's going to be a two-dimensional picture.
They were trying to find the photos and tried to find the form behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the form behind the pictures of the photos and the pictures of the photos and the pictures and tried to find the form behind the face.
And then they didn't found anything they were concluded that the divel of them here, after the missionarians with speaking with spears.
But the Waorani through not only extraorbiters, but also each other.
Fift-fift-five percent of their die.
We could have generalogies to eight generations to eight generations that we could get two cassed of a natural death of a natural death --
And then we gave them through that one man ever did that one man ever died that one man ever died -- and then he was just a born. But at the same time they had a amazing shaped ship. But at the same time.
Their hunters could be hunters to 40 passes and tell what animal animal species of what animal was the animal.

And to this sensational things that can understand what to understand something about this particularly believe about this particular belief of Vodou, that no cults is that not a cult of black magic magic is.
It's a complex metaphysal world's picture, very interesting.
Well, I would ask you the big worldreligions, what would you call say that?
Christiand, islam, booddhism --
One continent is always outside of the touch, the touch that Africa is needed the Sahara has no religious believed the Sahara did not had a religious.
Voodoo is simply the destillas of this device of religious ideas, in the tragic diaspora at diaspora time, in the tragic diaspora at diasporat.
What foodo, is the living, is the lives and the death.
The lives bars the minds of the mind.
The minds can be attacks to be under the Great Water, answer on the dance of the soul, the soul, the soul, so that during the soulduring of the entire of the following moment the following moment the god.
And so they say faith: "You're going to go to the church and talk about God.
We are dance in the temple, God." because you're so saying by the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a blued, to a bluedle told in trance that are punishing purpose glately glating collaborate.

And so it's the real thing to you. It's about you. It's the ech. They call himself the older brothers.
And then we are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And this is the intuits is the intuition is very important.
If we think of inition and landscape, we are often to Rousseau and the old fable, a idea that racist of the epartment of the early wanted to be a simplicity.
Or we take Thoreau and say that these people's closer than us.
Indiculations are nor sentiment, nor right by nor by nostalgigic noty.
For both is smooth space in the malariamoers of the Asmate winds of Tibet. Desealth of Tibet. Desealth by time and ritual mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical intuitional intuition is based on a lot of subtle, but on a much subtype that the Earth itself, because of the idea can be lived that the Earth of the Earth of the avavawar,
What does that mean? It means that a small child out of the And, that is growing is that the mountain an Apu-mind her locks, a fundamental other relationship to that grountains will be a different relationship of Montana, and a grountains of Montana, and a great Montana, growing the idea that the mountains to min.
Or it the lives of a mine of a mine of it, is a lot of it, is irreleance.
Interesting is the metaphor that keeps the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capitated to become caps.
And that made me a different than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forses that are the forests of Kuxwhue and the Kromms Snaval of the Hemel and the Kromms and the cannible of the world's world round the obvious swiwiwithin the north of the world's worth and the cannible of the world swirs that are in the north of the north and the Krombits that are the solic spirits that are of the culture, who are of the Hemel and the crows that are of the cups that they are of the culthrits of the Hever soke of the Hemel and the nornor
These mind are important at their Hamatsaineer Hamatsained.
If you start to the idea that these cultures are different realities to be able to get to start to get to a number of their extraordinary discoveries. No take this plant.
It's a photo that I say april in the Northern Amazon Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive active active active active active active active active across the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating makes not only the farmacological potential of it, but how it is. It's built to it. It's built of two sources.
Enerzy is there, there's a wood light carboline, harmaline and harmaline in the area and light hallucinating works.
If you only take the plant of the plant that a blue rookwalm by your awareness climited by your awareness capital.
The plant is mixs of mixs of a coffee like a coffee of a coffee of viridis.
The plant powerful trypty tryptamines, namine, because of brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine.
Do you ever see the Yanomami as they snumber of different species that are substance of different species that are also methoxy-dimethyltryltryltryltryltryltryltrys?
And that is that you have nose in blowing in a better of a being shots, and put up with barokay, to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not a distribution of the reality.
I was trying to my professor, Richard Evan Shults, to overwho's psychedelic ereded the psychedelic ered by his 1930s.
I mean that these tryptamines are not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect his individual -- nobody is indeed, no one more is to experience. Tryptled to experience the hallucination. Tryptamines are not to be their effectly in the human darmous in the human darmouth in the human darmouth in the human darmouth in the human darmouth of human darmous in the human daround in the human daround in the human daround in the human dareas h, oxidents.

The fascinating is that the bascinating carbolines in the limboline-crashed monoamine, the tryptamine of the tryptamine of the tryptamine of the trype of the flora of 80,000 plants, two morphological plants, that are are two morflated species that are binated to the shapes that are bigger than the several of the section of the society bigger than the section of the society bines that are bigione?
We say euphistic trial and there, which is a meaning called as meaningle, which is a meaningle.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us, what does that means that does that means that does the Cofan, the Cofan, who can identify all the big distance of ahuge distance to identify species, that they could identified in our eyes would be a species.
If you take their taxonomy how they knew what they knew you, say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
You know what? I said now.
And it turns out all the 17 species in a night in a night in a night in a night in different types in different types in different sings.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book than meels countly counter.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is even those of us that sympathy at the history of indicate, them as curious and smell and showing the history of the history as the history of the history world in history of our world, downails in the history of our world, down.
The truth is that the 20th century about 300 years to be not remembered to be his war or his war or his war in the world in which we were in, and active particips or passive particips or passive in the mass of biological diversity in the planet.
All cultures have always part of a new life capabilities.
Technology is not the problem isn't the problem.
The Sious indians not Sious to be Siout, when they gave their pile, and they gave their piled and the message of Americans -- when they gave their horse.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity of the ednavails. It's maching.
The wird face of the government.
What you look at the world, you will notice that it doesn't reference the lock of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living, whose existences by identified-ragile powers that are being powers that are being possibilities.
Or this is to be the enormous designed in the home country of the Penan, a nomadical South Asian equivalue that the rivers of lived and now is to service and now prostitution to the rivers, and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see the rivers of Borne, where you can see the rivers of Bornew Seage Chinese Zuid-Chinese Zuidd-clean Sevarners South waits await looks
to fill their ships of tree with tree of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases who are drons as a consequenced from the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains that I do a lot of research of political government --
Genocide, the physical exciting of a volved universal, but each the destroy of life, but each of the life of life is not only not only caused but in many areas in many areas in a part of developmental strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to be able to fat, until you get on the basic level level.
I have a young colleague of the colleague of Chengdu in Westn China to Lhasa.
And only when I was in Lhasa was in Lhasa was behind the statistics where you heard about it.
Sixty monuments destroy destroy 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The dad of my colleaguage was to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis he started to be killed directly when the Chinese invasy.

And one day they put a day on a poor in a poor of Mao. For this overper per per showed them seven years of the seven years of the seven years of the beam of the same through they were seven years of the poor --
The pain of Tibet can be increase in Tibet of the corner is something to core you.
And finally, the finally, it comes on a choice.
Will we have in a gray world of one-on-on-by-by-basical world of diversity --
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she was that she did that we did a general me, amoring world --
We won't only the human imagination are being limited to a smal, modal cader, but we would have been agreed to be another options of the other options are also exist.
We can feel to feel us feel in the idea that our species of the idea that our species of solid of the Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was our landbase that we gave us to the cult of the shaman being the potract of the shaman being the priest of the prieiest of the prieiests and a crived by specialization, only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This is a surface history is not the idea that we have all the answers of the answers of all the answers that are the next millennia on of our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to be the meaning of humans are being a 10,000 different voices.
And it is that in that song that we will discover the capacity to be able to be what we are, a folbeing what we are, a full in the work to all the stuff and all the garbaggreed. There are greats large-moments of optimism.
I have this photo the northern point of Baffin Island genomen, when I was was on the narrowing of Inuits on narrowing on the narrow.
This man, Olayuk, this man, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been invited for the Inter. In the 1950s, they were to say, to our souldn't have been placed in the corporation.
The opa of Olayuk to go.
The family of his life and discovered him already him already his tools.
Now, you need to understand that the Inside, they made it used to the cold.
The gline ice icyar-icians were made in the area of fish in cararibooms in care.
Olayuks up, not afafafafraid for the pollnight or the storm that wireless that wird.
He went out his browing skin his broek of seas, and put in his hands. And then he started the poops the poot started to freezing the shape of shape.
He speak a low-type of the side of the side.
And then the solid was, he sleeping a dogs.
He did the dogs and improvised a harnas.
And then from the ribbencouldbened.
He was looking at a dogs in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice foops --
Over with nothing around with nothing around coming around in many operating the resistance of the Inside and all inition's indicately in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government government back of a piece of country bigger than California and Texas together. It's called Nunavue.
It's independent area. They are all the resources.
It's a amazing example of how a native enough to her people can be able to off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly at least for who is at least to this home of the world is not very much a very far way.
They are somebody's home home called home home country.
They are standing for simply of the human imagination, that are going to go back to the beginning of time. And for us, the dream of these kids are just as that are one, part of a uninfected geography of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is invented the idea that politicians never accumber to be something like this.
We think that is that we think that a polemical -- we don't think that a polemic per -- but we think that stories can change the world, that we probably the world's best of the world's best 35 million times per 35 million times per a month of a monter month of a month countries on our time countries on public.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some some of you ask to what I have been a book to be a book a book
Maybe you can see parallels with information from other sources.
I try to explain what I'm saying to explain that you might have mistry.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the Western several dogma of all of the West.
And that official dogma dogma cattle, as follows on the highest level of our neighbors' level individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good is a great part of the human existence.
Boveners freedom to act a higher to across the insight, to accuttack a higher wonderful without of the insight?
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
Morchoices in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means more freedom more wonderful increase more amazing more freedom.
This is so deep in our society that no one would be during in our society.
And in our life is this dogma bit of a being breakfilled in our life.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
And then the dressings.
And also, that 175 cants, there are 175 cans are in my supermarket in my supermarket virgin my supermarket and a different balsoil and a different balsamicoil.
And that you can make the number of the case own drives, for the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the primart.
Look at electronics to electronics. You can state your your stereoset of stroneoset of course, cday's cassettal -- cassetttle, radio,
And in that one electronics that you can choose the choose of this piece of the picture.
You can see six and half million different systems cools with subjects, with subjects from that sharing --
Give -- then you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
And when I was young again, long you could call sorts of telephone services, but only only at Ma Bell.
You don't cryed it to be the state.
And that had the advantage that it never application.
That time.
Today there are a lot of different varies.
And the diversity is the diversity is the diversity is immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the toolst -- that with middle player, nose, nose, nose, right-burn, and critical clean.
Wellight you have this model in the store face of you can see this model that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and asked this question.
And you know how the answer to that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question that question of how the answer answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the continue of stuff, is this explosive of choices of choices of choices of choices are a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. is not so that you have to go to the doctor, and that you know, you should be doing what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do At we can do At we can do that.
A has this picture and nadelivers.
And then the picture of this and nadels. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, what does you?"
And the doctor, "Am has this pick and nadelen, and Britics, and narrate.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, if you was, I was what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you're nothis."
And we call it ""self-inbring the patients."
That is a very positive, but means the heavy task of decision of the close of decision of things -- the doctors -- the doctors -- to a seemed -- to a seemull and not the best condition has been certainly certainly to decision. For to recipe of recepts.
Good profound that shows that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy them.
Why makes it doesn't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctomorrow to ask that other market to ask that other market --
Our identity, yet is a brible aspect of us existence, is now across the entire of choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is to core our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we can do ourselves.
Every morning morning to the opposition of what you want to be what for person you.
Let's talk about the marriage, the famous.
There's a time that that you can get anybody anybody from the case of you could get so quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as qu
The only real choice was with writing, not when and what you did do.
Now, now is a freedle everything for op.
I give lesson intelligent students, which I would have 20 percent less homework less than homework at least than that.
They don't be heard in the way in the ways of the last time.
No, they have drug with choices.
"Well, I say, "Well, I no? Well, I no?
Or I'll take it to wait? Now, I mean children, or a career?"
These are all true of these are all questions.
They are going to have a answer to them, if this means that they don't get all their homework and there, and therefore of the cumber corn.
And they have equal. They're important to questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just that technology is that technology to work every minute that every minute of every minute world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a place one place, which I mean, where WiFi the got.
I don't slept because I don't want to keep that place for me.
But good, who are enormous choice in that we are going to work in that we are going to work on the times of the time, or we're going to work on the right not.
We can look at a football weddle, with our cell phone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on school.
And even if they all stand every minute of that competition of that competition with all kinds of competition with all kinds of questions?
Well, I think this emailt reager? And I think this letter letter this?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" -- experience, we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
What we also look at it, the big, the grate, materialist smally, lifestyle: life is a question of choose is a question of choose.
And so the world early early there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad of bad --
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we know is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad about bad about what is bad about it.
And the huge choice has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings.
A very high-point is that the earlier is before than companies.
And in the way many choices are invented to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of investigatic investments in freedom.
A colleaguage of me got to invest in the United data of Vanguard, a big policy society of the works, a big policy about 2,000 bits of 2,000 vestigations.
They discovered that for every simply 10 percent fundred the work of work -- the particular two percent of the work of the work of two percent of the work of every side of the worket of every side of the worker of the worker polite that is the worker in every similar percent fundred that for every tions of the work of every tiple of the wor
If fifty fundred 10 percent less works, than five founds?
Because it at fift-fellow is so difficult to choose that people just choice to the next day, and that are the next day, and that are the next day, and that are the thing.
And of expensive.
That doesn't mean that that people after their pensionate after their pensioner because they haven't been able to eat the time, but also the choice, but also that she was so did that she was working for the work-saany for them.
And they were going to be able to put 5,000 dollars a year on their nose for a year.
The worker was namely to double.
So the To many choice-freedom can work in the freedom
And I think the world that looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right choice makes the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit up with the wrong fundress the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect of us as well, as we had the dishape, eventually less text with the result of the result of the result would be if we had less options less options as we had less the less of us as a less options as we had lear.
And there are multiple of the reasons for that.
And one of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice that the choice didn't perfect.
You can put you in such a case for that another choice would have better better better.
This is dreamed alternative alternative to your choice that you get from your choice.
And then does the break of the choice of choice that you have made you've made a good choice.
The more options there, the more options of the core is to easier to have been easier to have every element of the course.
Second reason of substitutives.
Dan Gilbert from morning, we have been able to how often the value of things that we are using them to the value of things that we are comparing.
If you can invite many alternatives of all the alternatives of all alternatives that you discuss.
That makes you have less text less text that you have chose to you've been chose to you.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the strettiny of this example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a fairly second a through second hight.
They are on a beautiful beach. Straling again.
Don't you any? "Done? "Dak." That's a called "it's augghtly augght.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is in my neighborhattan is in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city in Manhattan is the city.
I could parker, I could park my car for the door."
And he is that he is two weeks to simmulate the idea that he every day again, a great parking mission of the idea that he is mission.
Substitutic cost of the entire chost of the entire choice that we have a great choice.
The more possibilities are there, the more attractivities are.
And those presents are presenting to us as substitutives.
Another example.
This pictures that pictures are right now,
Life in the here and now is that you should not be overhearing things that you shared to be able to continue and now you shared.
And another thing that you have a point of every choices of choices.
And all of the other has so been so much of the other has been so been involved being less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this is my quest to my search a new brow.
I always touched speaking.
Because it was only one kind of played broed, and that bought your dance, it was incredibly unbelievable, but if you were the broek long enough and enough the broek of the right every long enough and the right OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new new.
I said, "Dag, I want to get a spield, this is my makes my make.
And the storeer said, "Wilt you fit clem fit, easy or relaxed to relaxed to relaxed to relaxed to relaxed to be smart or relaxed to be smart or relaxed to be smart --
Do you know if you have a rits? While was? Do you have stone-was?
Do you know a break with slide?
You know, you know, you know, a bit of pip, or flating pip." And so he went down." And so he was just through this.
I was talking about it. And I was talking about a while, I said, "I want the only browing browing there before."
He didn't have a idea that was and so I have a long time for an hours of all possible broken all of the possible brows.
And I think of honestly is honestly I left the store with a broek.
I had better better this. And I was couldn't do it better.
But I don't felt better.
Why? To you get this to memiself to explain myself.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, I was that I started to expect more than the fast.
I started without any expectation, because I only knew --
And then then turned out there were different and one of them would be a section,
And what I was good, but not perfect.
And so I was my browing with my broek with my broek, and that stated me to do that.
The more possibilities people have discussions about the distant of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tevalences are less teving.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
In the really is going to be about it.
Everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad -- people could have experienced experiences.
In our modern society can we have a courage citizens of citizens -- but the best thing we can achieve it for a citizens that something so good as we had to have been so good as well.
Never we are surprise, because our expectation, my expectation, my expectation,
The cret of happiness -- this is the secret -- the secret of happiness.
I want to ask here -- I want to say -- that I am -- that I -- that I am -- that I am with a woman who really is fantastic.
I didn't have her with her teving.
But with less enough less enough, are good cans.
And finally, when you get a bad of bad bad bad bad of bad bad and buy the bad of being ond as one species -- you can ask you questions why you're unted.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks available and you buy a that turns out to fall the time, who is than answer?
The answer is just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different broken you don't have an excusions.
So if people decision of those decision of those decision of that decision of those decision of choice.
And they take themselves quality.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations higher generations high-time.
A factor -- not the enige, but a significant factor at this explosive totor in this explosion of depression of depression of the expectations.
And if they try that television for themselves to explaining themselves the descene.
So the netoresulate is that we are objective on the objective, but our bad of bad and feel bad of course.
And then a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody to be touched to be touch.
But that's not.
It doesn't seem to choose better than can't choose better than hold it is better than automatically that choice is better better choice.
There's a magic border, I don't know.
But I know that we have been in for for for for for the point that choice are welling us well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost countly -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of best to be the best of the best of the best of the best of best to be the best
The choice in industrialized countries comes from material overflowing out of material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem isn't so much choice that there is a lot of choice.
The paradox I was talking about here with name for the moderneat, wonderful Wests.
That's frustrating, and this is frustrating here, and I said that dure and installowed that dure and installing the through and did of your money.
I say the same thing about this three, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help it. Erger right.
They make us like, less value.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to make the people have to be able to put that people on the forward of the people have to expect that people have in forward.
And we also have to be able to put our life.
That's what economists call an Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by redistribution -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choice that we are coming with our choice that we are with our measura.
And finally, if you take this picture, if you like, you're going to be as developed human saying, "Ach, what does you know about it?
Nothing is possible in a vision."
A lot of imagination, a short-her global -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I was going to get thought, I was better that this fish, I was deeply slim is very smart.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you are the visual, you don't have the fish, you don't have freedom, but you don't have freedom, but losing.
If you put the visual broke to create possibilities, you get less texts.
It leads to more lock and less text less text.
Everybody needs a senk of course.
This is a certainly certainly -- even for us.
But the dividual figured to ask is to ask to ask is asking to ask to elling it, increase --
Thank you for your attention.
