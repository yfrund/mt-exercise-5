And then, I showed these two slide of slide that the polar capture that the pollast three million years, about the size of the size of the United States of the United States with 40 percent curved
But this is the researching of this particular problem because it did not the disection of the ice.
The ice capital on the North Pole, in a sense, heart of our global climate global climate system.
It put out in the winter and crach in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a accelerated version of what happened in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice ice is dividual.
As you see, it set out of dark blued.
That's the year, that's the early age the winter.
And it craces in summer.
The called ice, five years or older five years or older is almost like blood, that from the body, that from the body,
In 25 years of this went from this to this craft
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern Icelebrate Icelebrate of there, and there's a very big frozen carbon frozen carbon did, when it was dead, by microbes in methane, when it was deployed by microwing microws around the North Icell warms and there.
And compared to the total amount of the total responsible in the atmosphere, would double the amount of the corner.
In some of the undeep aning in Alaska borrelt methane of the water.
Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another undeep to another undeep me.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is real or we will be that.
A reason for that, is that this enormous "warmtebron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt ater river.
The water volume is bigger than ever ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuaven-Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea legal style because it is the place because it is the place where it is comes in the sea.
These currently take up to the currents.
At the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
Popening month reported to report the entire continent now is a negative ice balance balance is now a negative ice.
More specifically is the ice in the west of the South Pole, very quickly, very quickly, with some underwaters any underwaters.
The whole continent is six meter, the whole continent is the whole continent of meter.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice massa, there are now new now, that were now going to be a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water drinking water ts.
In the Andes, this glass the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more streams.
But when they disappeareding, it disappears the drinkwater.
In California was there a 40 percent in the snowwpak of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water reservoires.
And as you could read reading the predictions are the predictions
This global dreamatic dreamatic dramatic stye of bosing fire.
And the number of natural rames around the world is cities, with an incredible and never seen.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unexperience.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton at CO2 24 hours of CO2 hours ...
Fifty meton every day in our oceans, Look at the eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, from America, from America, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic drification of oxygen in the oceans.
The only big cause of the warming of the Earth, nast, nast, which is the burning for 20 percent is fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem and crop buy is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest exercisions, together with China.
And there was a lot more urbing carbon-circutts.
But we see a reverse of it.
These are the spining carbon classed in the last carbon years, and where green alternatives were presented in the last few years, and where green alternatives were presented in the last carbon carbons.
There's a political battle, there's a political fight?
The step carbon and oil industial gave 250 million dollars to promote clear clear and oil, which is a carbon carbonain, which is a contraffic.
And that image me me about something like that.

Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to get back with an home of how that machine works.
So here's me. For the ones that there were no long, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever supposed in the surrounds.
It has to be the circumstances that were present less than a billion a billion dollars second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, so, this!
This is the machine under Geneve.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one I work. And this is the one I work. It's called the ATLAS.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS.
At 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That was a party stemployed in the controlleks.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all the way around the LHC went around the LHC with a piece with a piece of the LHC, and with the detector.
In other words, when we were saw that picture 10 September we knew that the machine worked on the machine worked in the machine worked in the machine worked in the machine worked on the other worked,
I don't know if this was the largest of this was the largest of the biggest of this, when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet pagina and saw that the Internet pagina and saw that the Internet pagina was going to be so fixated.
That means we have a both cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden carries.
And they were able to put 13 thousand amper refle, when the machine on full force the machine on full force
The engineers are going to say, "Not true. It's too small weight."
They can do that because they can do is superceive are of temperatures.
So at the min 271 degrees of space the stars, who can discovered the stars, who can carry that did power to it.
In one of the constructions between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And through the wire was something warmer, and there was a little bit of electric weather against 13 thousand ample ample of course.
This was the result.
This is another impression if you realizing that magnets more than 20 tons of tons and they were about 30 centimeters of inches were going to move.
We did about 50 magnets.
We had to put them out of it.
We all have tool, you all tool.
Now, they are back away.
Eind myself the LHC weather is going to be intact.
We will put him again, and we expect measures in June or June so we can go further with the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have unhappened to debate the debate of the value of science. It's easy to research.
I think it's so hard is that it's so hard is that we go further than ever going to be further than the LHC.
I leave the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I disape, during the defines of the value experiments of his teachers, his learning was Michael Faraday, this is so dangerous definitely for the human mine of the human mind that our images of the human mind that there are no mysteries of the science of the physician, and that our surfaces are not a new world, and that our definedly won't define."
Thank you very much!
I would like to start to ask you to ask to your childhood at your childhood at your childhood at your childhood played with blocks of
When you discovered how to flu to understand she was surped and removed to learn by learning the depended by the depenter of space relationships.
Rumble insight is strong because with the understand the world to us.
If a information of inspired by the nurture of physical interaction with objects -- with my adviseer with my adviseer Jee of Kalanith, I started to ask me -- what if we were a computer to ask -- what if we were a computer of that one mouse and fingers of a moise of the mouse of digital fingeral fingerred with a finger-fish interaction that moved with both of information flating field fish of information and we could figure field,
and orders as we want?
This question of us so decided that we decided to search a response by the building of Siftables.
Cort together is a Sift is an interactive computer in size of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cookie.
They can be movement with the hand they can be able to feel each other, they can detect a screen and they contact a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade, as blocks they can be moved by understanding to grain and flying to figure out of it.
And the table, Siftable, a example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
So that this aid resources have a more physical different direction, aware of their movement and even of the way we movement and even of the way we move, there are different new and nice interactions of the way we moved and nice.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sift is institude, to show a video to change a video celebrating and others and others played and played played played in the backwards
These interactive portraits are awareness.
And then they will be placed to each other for each other for each other for each other --
If they are surrounded this and they can do this, and can be able to set this,
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting conquired of the interesting conquences of the interaction, the using of the interesting of the color as it was a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid and it was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interest
In this example three Siftable, three Siftables, and I can use them to go into a leg and I can use to engy color in a leg with color.
If we have drive, we pick up what we did back.
There are some cappe possibilities for education, mainly play play with language, mathematics and logics where people want to try to try to try to try to see things quickling things fast.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci programmmatic programmmatic programmmatic programmmic.
Here we show you a game that a cross-cross-cross-Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every raround a rarely letter to every Siftable, and sensed words are controlled in a dictionary dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is going to be rescued and shake a new series of series of letters with means of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some children on excursion to the Media Lab, and I was cloads to make it try to make it it out to make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have people almost no instructions.
Everything you need to say, "Make words" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the test of trip.
That's our young barray tester, right?
And it seems that he just said the Siftable.
For him were just this blocks.
Here is a interactive painting shown again.
We wanted to learning a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring characters in the scene of the scene, by just the Sift with that character-coard with that characters of the table.
He shows the sun coming up the sun here.
Video: The sun is coming up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Yeah! Yeah!
By shake the shape of Siftable, and the next to each other he's the characters with each other -- Video: Weafter that.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decisions how it did it dist.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I will show you that I will show you a synthesizer and live music instrument that we have evolved to every Siftable, where every Siftable, like the lead, bass and drum.
Engling has four different variations where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
And these sounds can be injected in the leading Siftable, so you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the attern, by a leading Siftish live controlled live controlled as reverble affects like reverb and filter.
They are being a sound of sound and added by cance.
And before the general effects like tempo and volume that are applicated on the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a lot of a leads, to a lot of lost pattern, a lota lead.
Now, I place the basline here.
Video: There's now I feed some slagwork.
Video: And now I buy the filter of the drums, so I can influence.
Video: I can do it by the way, I can do it by the canes of the county of the block of the block of the block of the block of the block of the cans of the country accelerating the cancelerate of the canes of the country accelerating the cans of the tempo of the tempo of the tempo of the bloc
Video: There I can buy the filter of the basic for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reproducing the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to planning anything to plann, but I can improvise it very longer and shorter like I want.
With the dims of the dims of the volume by the volume Sift to cance.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion from the making new mension-computer interfaces that have been stiled in the way our brain and bodies working and bodies working and bodies working and bodies work.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area with some possibilities that we developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is only the attackage to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we wanted to ly.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to go out with you all and talk to you all it.
I am write.
Books write my work, but also much more than that.
My entire life long I said to write all of living and I don't think that it will change it.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, and career, where I had to see my relationship my relationship with my work with my work with my work again.
It started with a book that I did under, a memoire, a memoire, "Eten, Biddle in the opposed to my first work and I was a very opposed to my first world and a international existing bests the whole world and an international existence.
The consequence is people all over the all over the whole and always if I did it down to the bottom.
Well, what -- you know, does!
People are coming to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you very concerned this success never will be equatequival?
You don't know that you will not be afraid you will be write lives write but never publishing the book, where people will be heating where people will be heat?
You don't have anyway?
And you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very much that would be very much suspicient -- I was when I was a teenager, when I was write I write to write I write to be write.
People said, "You don't afraid you never get success of success is never get?
Don't you go afraid for dece, that you will go on through through it.
Now, if you don't afraid you live to this work without that there ever set that you will die, and you will die, and you will die, and you will die, you will die, you will die, you will die, you die, fill of bitters?
Something in that stretch.
And in the short, my answer to the questions of this, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called things being called
Always it always do.
But I also much other things that I am for a lot of other things that I am all of it.
For seawe, for example, and other one things.
But what does write write I mean, I mean, where it fear from.
Is it rational?
Is it logically somebody is to be afraid to be afraid to be the work for the work for the work for their opinion on on Earth?
What is so particularly so exactly as we worry to creative processes that we worry on the minds, something that is not happened to the effects of work in the minds.
Now, you take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a took at 40 years that he was asked to him or he didn't have any for the long for it.
And that's what John, how it is it with your chemistry blockadi?"
No, so it didn't have been talking about it.
Fair to be fair to be engineers have been engineers have also not the reputation of the reputation of manical depressive alcoholists.
Schrools writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have the reputation mental reputation of the reputation of being instable.
Look at the most magnifican-down, the most magnificant creative minds the most magnificant creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by its own to do it.
And even those of those who don't seem to be suicide of the suicide of the suicide of the gave of their gaves of the suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a pretty to say about your life work.
But of these kind of speaking of these kind of speaking of this.
We all heard it before and have heard it all accepted with the same and with it all accepted.
The heard thought is that creativity underivity underivity is going to be suffered with suffering and that is going to be an artist, lead to the miserable.
So why do I want everybody here today, you can ask with that idea of life?
Are you going to do that?
Because I agreed, I think about it I think it doesn't have pretty thought.
I think it is the reference.
And then it seems to be dangerous.
I wouldn't see this century.
We can have a lot of better reference to live sports.
I sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark thought to be thought to live to that dark thought of the dark of thought of life.
And the phases the fase where my careers now in which my career.
Yes, you know, I'm young, amper rattle.
I can work in four decade four decades --
Hunction, probably will be anything I now publish the outside world as it is work that followed on that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends under each other -- so I can slapping you probably slight my largest success for me.
Yes, what a idea!
If you go think, is that if you go to the morning for negled hours to the drank.
So I don't want to this.
I love me show me with the work I love with the work where I love love.
The question is, "Hoes this?"
And after long after a long after a long time I can only go through with writing by writing a psychological protection in the process inbuilding inside the process inbuilding in the process inbuilding inside the process inside the process of inside the process inbuilding that I can only go through a psychological
I have to write during a safe distance between myself and my overwhich, and my overwhich, understanding angled to my futures at my future.
I had looked at the last year to ways to ways to do.
I did in history and I did me depends in other societies have found in other depends have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been broad to me with the old Greeks and Romeins.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Romeinen and Romeinen believed that creativity was not creativity of themselves.
And then, you know, that creativity was a divity of a divital mind, unknowledge place to the human being came in.
The Greeks now called these treat minds of creativity "demonen."
And so, Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that he had a dished words influence of this.
The Roman had a kind of a kind of idea.
And in the way of the called them was a geniused to a genius.
The funny is the Romeins with a genius, a genius is not a particularly pient,
In their promised was a genius was a kind of magic entity and entity that have been picked in the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the house.
If the artist was working for the work, put assistence.
And he said, "Well, he gave shape shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to work.
The artist, was taken in protection to the against of the narcism.
If you were working on the rilliant there.
Everybody knew that you had holped a geniusible genius.
Well, you work from the way that it doesn't just let you have a picture of you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genius.
Long time is that had been considered how in the Westen creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed and changed
There is a very new idea: the individual human beings is the individual human beings is the middle point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, from the divailable world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual.
And for the first time in history was talking about artists being said that they were said that they were a genius.
I have to say that I have to say that I have a big mistake.
To one person, one person, one person, one person to believe he or she or she or she or she or she said, the currently, the source of the century of the century, of everything did familiar and it's known for a fragile human psyche.
like you somebody asks you to sw.
Egos are blowing up to a gigantic proportions and there are unimaginable high-expectations of prestations of prestations of prestations and there's expectations of the subjects.
And I think this pressure, this pressure, the last 500 years of artists,
If that, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we understand back to a older understanding of the relationship between the relationship mystery.
Maybe not.
Wellight we can do 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of spech.
Probably in the audience people who have tools have been talking about the idea that have been talking about the idea that elphysics have been talking about feeding purder the work of artists to inspirate artists to inspirate heights to inspirate heights.
It doesn't seem to be getting you all of you in that.
And I mean, I wouldn't write it down.
Why not?
Why should we have thought that thought to next to next to next that thought to do it.
It was just as much hits as much hits as all the other explainability that decided that decided that decided that decided to the creative process.
And everyone who have anything to create is to create something that has been trying to create -- so in fact, we know that the creative process here -- knows that the creative process is not always rational process --
That it sometimes it feels a paranormal.
I have recently, the wonderful American closer Ruth Stone of the wonderful American courage.
She's close, she is writing her whole life all life she directions.
She told me about her jeught on the country of Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the field of work, she was ever she heard a poem on the country.
It was, so said, she said, she also like there was a big wave air.
And so, you know, poem golf than the country to her her.
She felt that the ground under her feet, and knew that knew that was under that her at that point to do is standing for her life: running for her life.
She was running home, back through the close and she had to see so quickly possible and paper to see picks.
When the poem through her came her was golves her only to write it was her only to write it in the wave.
Sometimes she wasn't fast.
Then run, but run, it's not home.
And in such mmoments schools at her through her it, search -- in hearing -- in hearing -- in her words -- to a different close.
And then there were one another thing -- this is the most micture part of the story -- that they were the poem -- that they almost mistake.
And then she was in the housearch for paper and paper and paper it was poems by her its its its it.
Juist at that point she had a pencil she had a pencil
And with her other hand, she told me she was poected the poem from the air.
She picked the poem with his tail, and pulled it back in her body, and she written it again.
In that cases the case came in that case, but then in the very paper of paper and it was in the follow.
When I heard that, I thought -- what happens to be so far to be my creative process of course,
This is how my creative process not! I'm not a medium!
I am a mile, who every day on the same time, and the same time, and sweating with blood, sweating and transwing through it is rising and flowing through the same time.
But even in that day heavy I had one of this experience.
You also know it will also know that there are creative ideas that there creative ideas in your course of a source of a source that you can identify impossible you can identify impossible of you can also know that you can see impossible that you can also know that you can also know that you can also know that there is a feeling that there is creative ideas in your broive
What is that before?
How can we use the without we are being crazy?
At a way that is good for us?
The best contemporaine example I can think I can think I can think of musicians Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine for a magazine magazine.
We had the way it this.
And in fact, a big part of his life had been part of his life had been covered of the same today artist that makes out of all power to get to the uncontinue of the unition that incontination that has been industry.
With the years, Tom some ringer.
And one day he read in Los Angeles over the speaway, and changed it the process of radical.
And as he got this fragmental here, he heard a fragmental of a melodia.
The decided him, like inspiration that it does it decided to him --
It was a beautiful nice and he wanted to hold it it was a holds.
But it wasn't that.
He had no paper, no paper -- no paper at its time.
The famous exciting exciting excited exciting the melody and then it turns out to me the melody remains me to follow.
I don't am good enough, I can't am it."
He didn't real in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sheit?"
"Think I can really write a song of you can write a song of you can write a song of you can write a song you on a song of you can do a song you now?
If you really want to get this song, you have to close to another one of you have to have a lot of time.
Now, that's not going to be able to fall.
Ga neighborhood, from Leonard Cohent." And from that moment was walking the process of different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the familiar underto.
But the heavy spansing that the creative process in him disappeared when he distance the genius.
The genius was to close to the skin and livered only close.
And I realized that there was no reason through to go.
It could be a wonderful, bizard couldn't be a wonderful conversation between Tom and the owners that not quite from Tom himself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a lot of agreed.
I was in the middle of Eten, Biddly, Biddly.
And I was given moment I did in desperate in despership.
You know that well, you want to work and you can't do well-horrible disast. The worst book. The worst book.
Not side ble there, really horrible horrible of it.
I wanted to have the entire project.
And then I rememed Tom that Tom that showed to his genius, and I decided to way.
I wished me from my manuscript and focused to a leg corner and I got to a leg corner of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know both of all this is not just through me.
You can see I have all of the stuff in me.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better can, you have to do you get your thing to do.
You don't know that? Do you don't know that, understand you're not, right?
I just write down, because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notte is going to be faile, that you can just away from the office of the office age."
And I think it's coming up here in the right -- it's the here on the down.
Euws came up with the North African desert people in the North African desert people to dance in the sacres of music.
And then hours and hours figure, to the ochecke.
That was always great, because the dancers were full professionals.
But sometimes very single happened to be something like this,
One of that dancers was then transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean with that, you also have you see, you know, you also see something like a performer.
It was like the time stood and the danced the dancing and the dance,
He nothing else than the thousands of nights of thousands of nights together.
And suddenly it looked at a lot of seemed to a human being.
In him, under him, above him, above him glow.
A fired fired fired him.
And if you did something like the happened, knew people who had been able to clapping them to clapping and clapping in charge, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historically fact, when the Moren South South Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanis considered with me.
The question is realized by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ole, oone."
That hurt today at the day at the day at the day and flamengodance.
If a put in Spain, something impossible or magically cally, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, broa."
And, understanding se: a small of God.
Precipations what we need.
Lastile is that the dance the dancing morning the next morning the following of the dincluding 11 hours of the morning charge of the morning.
At that moment he is again, he is a little older man with depently, that maybe never to zulk more to such highs.
Maybe there's never going to have anybody God attackage.
What has to do you have to the rest of his life?
That's hard to it.
That's really hard to square to sing a creative spirit of a creative spirity.
But it doesn't need to be it doesn't have to be it down.
Imagine you don't have any aspects of your person aspects of your person common and from yourself.
Imagine you believe them a while, you know, she had a while, I mean, you know, a specificate of a source.
When you ready around with me, they are being she spending to somebody else.
That's what it is to considered everything.
I hang inflying in the minds.
The last months I've been working on a book that in shortly shortly where much of reach to long time.
The conceptible of that illustrated.
If my thought with me the hold of the hold I went to me, I went to the same force.
You just work you work.
You just do this, what it is.
If you task you very task you am to dance.
If the dival genius that you is to decide to decision to your work at work at a time, something of the moment of the moment of the moment of the wonderful source, "Ol!"
Then not, dance then, dance then, dance it down.
And then, "Ol!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe of hearts.
"Ol!" whatever it is because we pure from pure human love and owner wisdom by the pure of human love and owners.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discoveres of new sets sets of sets genes.
We actually start to go from a new point: we were the biology of biology at the digitize of digitize to a new phase, to try from the digital code to a new phases and synthetic designing and synthetims of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think of biologists have tried to understand on different levels in different levels of this.
We have tried different approach, it tried to minimize the minimipate.
We're now almost 20 years at the digition.
When we have sequenced, it went from the analog of the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the biology, to the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask you, can we live regenerate life, or can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a species that can multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to look if we can get to a none-genome.
We can put in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or soil,
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively simple to the one.
Feak me, this is simple.
But when we look at all of the genes we can broke piece of piece of per piece of the genes of a living cell that this would cell cell that this would have cell cell that this would be a living cell of the genes that we can get per piece, it's very unlikely that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell that this would be able to
We decided that the only route prevalue to synthetic this chromosome of the most fundamental so we could declined to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions as "Can we started a chromosome synthetim?"
So the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never see.
And, if we do that, can start?
A chromosome of chemical iners is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our tempo of the digitions of life is accement on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code of slow of slowly, but is genome.
And our last point would it put it at the time, it would put in an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of stadia couple of stage, with a bio-ethical toring for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult is.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA make, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, the more mistakes of how longer you make, the more mistakes of thousands of machines in the world that small piece of DNA machines in
So we had to do a new method to put a new method of these little pieces and corrating all the mistakes.
And this was our first attemptemptemptemptemptee of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death.
We were designed the pieces, did the foutcorrection.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we started to piece when we piece of a piece of chemical stopping the genetic code and the bacteria code of genetic code and make viral particles went to make it was.
The viral particles were solved from the cells, they were showed from the cells, they were showed the E. coli.
I was until I was until with the oil industry, and I said she was to capture, and I said snapping that model but all of too fast.
They laughts more than you.
That's why we think this is a situation where the software, where the softward-within a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the ential bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in size of viruses, so we could virus, so we could varians the cassettes ...
to go to understand what the real components of a living cell components of a living cell right now.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that needs to be very digital information of it.
When we first put it together for the first time in 1995 was the standard in 1995 was the standard per 10,000 basepars.
And then we found after resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence of the original sequence than it was not to start to start to start.
And the design of the design is the design pieces that have to continue long that have to continue with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so they can design so they can design so that they can design so that they can design so they can go to design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design so that they can design as much as down
We design here unique unique unique of this.
Maybe you have read water notices that we have water nots.
There is this: we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, Go's and T.
Trio's of those letters are code for back, 20 aminose -- that there is a only unletters -- that there is a only unletters for each aminozure.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sin, thoughts.
At a signed of course, we just "Is a mouth.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no poems were no poems
We have designed these pieces of so we can eating them with enzyms.
There are enzyms they repairs and they put in each other.
And we started to make pieces of them to start with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were longs, and you have piece of 24,000 letter, and you have piece of 2,000 letter, 2,000 letter, until 2,00.
In every stadium we have a confluence of these pieces of pieces so that we could sequencing them because we want to create a process that is going to be very robuobust -- that will see you can see the primary push of you can see that touched them to sequencing them to sequencing them to sequencing them to sequencing them to sequencing them to sequencing them to
We try to reach the point of automatization
So this looks like a basketbal.
Once we come up with the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basevars -- then they don't grow easily more than 10,000 baseparating in E.
That is the expensive of all the modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to raisms of other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologist, "homologist, that is used by the biology to repairs to repairs together.
Here's a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiodor raws to radiod the real.
That you see in the top panel, she sees a chromosome, just the chromosome of each other.
12 hours later 12 hours later it was in each other, as it was first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can completely have been fully dried in the rooms can completely
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space, that you can find move, that can find move, a new aquatically environment.
NASA has married shows that there is lots of outside there.
Here's a real microphose micropho-o-of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually only yesterday with the right design of the pieces where we were in them.
And it makes it automatically says.
This is not an electronen-microscope picroscope pphotograph.
It's about a big moleculecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of seconds.
This is the publication that we have recently.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest moleculecule of molecule, with a clear structure.
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-points letter, without spations, no spations of pages and then there's 142 pages to present the genetic code away.
Well, how do we start a chromosome of the same up? How do we activate?
With a virus is clearly easy to be a virus of easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you dealing under the eukaryots, like us, you just whether you know the cell cell cell cell cell out of the cell of you know.
And the bacteria species species of the bacteria of chromosome, but we have shown in the cell transplant transplant that we can exect a complete transplantation of a cell to a different, and it can activate it and it can active.
We have a chromosome of the microb-species of a microb-species.
These are about so far from each other as people and microw as people and mice.
We add some extra genes that we could have to be able to select this chromosome of the crow.
We have the triple of enzymes to make all the proteins of the proteins of all the proteins of the proteins of the protein of the proteints.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of this, and the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell --
We even thought he would come up to the process of it would come to develop the process of what farther to develop the process of developing that process to develop process to develop the process of developing that he would come to develop it for developing to develop the process of developing that they were going to be able to developing the process.
This is an essential evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of kinds of that have a second chromosome of the other third somewhere they have thousands of properties in one time they have thousands of properties in one time of the species.
People who are evolution evolution as if there was one of the equal to change in the same time, not a lot of biology have been true.
There are enzyms that are restriction enzyms that are actually called DNA fashion.
The chromosome that was not ever ever ever ever ever ever did it.
The cell -- the chromosome of it -- well, we stopped -- well,
It was expresses and it recognized the other chromosome of chromosome of the material, and therefore it was eventually in the cell of the cell of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the cell chromosome of the chromosome of the cell chromosome of the cell of the cell of chromosome of the cell of the cell of the material, and it was the other chromosome of the cell of the cell of the cell of the c
He was blue because of the genes we had stopped in it.
And in a very short time disappeared of all the characteristics of the one species and changed the new species, he changed in the new species, and he had been put in the cell we had stopped in the cell we had stopped in the cell of the cell of the new species,
All the proteins changed the membrans -- when we changed the genetic code of the genetic code was changed.
This may be clinically as genomically as a genomical alchemistry, but we're in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally.
Well, I have been paid before this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is probaborn at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we may be a new version of the Cambric explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Camborn explosion of this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what it needed is.
We're going to go from six-a-half to billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planets,
for each of us that lived in 1940 years, within 40 years, that there are four being four are.
We have a food, with food, with food, with the clean water, medicine, fuel for the six-en-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that.
We use five billion tons of collabor, more than 30 billion ts.
That's 100 miloen fats per day.
When we have biological processes in ogencoul, or what process than anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then there's all that carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere.
And through our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had been just a dozens of components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that there is a dozence of diversity that has come out of the diversity that there is a diversity had been there.
We are limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have this thanks very quickly, very quickly synthesia to do called combination called combination genomics."
We have the capability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you put 20 million different genes, or trying to optimity, or trying to optimitate octan, or trying to produce octan, we can produce to produce octor, then we can change with a small team biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's only standard of the standard of it.
We can select for life-vatability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen maficimagination of what real design software where we work on the gets of the corn and a new species on the computer.
We don't know how it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code of their genetic code of it.
We focus on fourth generation fourth generation fuels.
And you have seen the ground of you have seen the ground of the bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuels will come from the inner capital cost, like sugar, to more high-higher fuels like octan, or different species like octanol.
But the only way we think biology can have biology biology can have big influence without the food price higher and the availability is to reduce as we start design with CO2 as his food subject and design that we do it in that way, and we think we are the first fixed in about 18 months of fixing in about 18 months of the first furnitured fire.
Slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery -- we have all have other methods.
This is an organism that we have described described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea of 2.5 miles deep, in the deep, with cooking,
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We are looking at the way if we can take CO2 we can be able to put through through the pipates that CO2 is being shape where CO2 is being shape, to stone, to stop this process.
So in a short time spend of the time we are able to continue to the basic question: What is life?"
We have a realized -- you know, the dish of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where what?
A important energy sources.
But we also use these tools are also using these tools to think of these tools to think of these works.
This year was the flu -- we just walking something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by making vaccines of combined vaccines.
Here is how the future of the future, you can see the future, the accelerate tree is going to change with synthetic bacteria and eventually bacteria and then end of evolukaryota.
We're more far from the improved of the improve people.
Our goal is to sure, to sure, we make a chance of survival to do that may be doing a long enough to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that may be able to do that makes you may be a chance to survive.
What I want to show you as a first of a new technology that we have to show you is a new technology we spent to a new technology that we have about a year ago. This is Sedragon. This is Sedragon.
And it's a surroundation where you local local or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data.
We look at this here many gigabytes here and can be able to keep in digital images and then may be able to zoom in and then made the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and the sort of terms and then maybe in the wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how big these collections or images are or image.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the in 300 megapion.
It all doesn't matter nothing from the only thing would be influence, on a through system, the amount of pixels on the screen of the screen of the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of non-image of its data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Every columned is a chapter.
And to prove that this is really text text and not picture, and we can't do something like this, to show you that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange of a bunch of the book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistically example. This is an example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a party.
This is really gives you the pleasure of a real paper magazine or capitating or capital corner or capital is actually a scale medium.
We also done something about the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep adversed adversed of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limits of actives through the screen through the screen of accounts.
We hope this this is not a pop-ups more means and other subject will be needed to be need.
Of course, are land maps for the hand maps of country like this, I will not spend a time of this, I will not spend a lot of time we can contribute this field --
These are all the roads in the U.S.
And then it places on the top of the NASA --
Let's look something else.
This is a married live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other --
One of them is Seating a celebrate piece of computer vision by Noah Snah Statavely, promove, promoting to the University of Washington, dedepension U.W.
and Rick Smyiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this, we seeing this, we seeing the images and the multi-resolution.
The space of the images has meaning.
The computer vision mes have been broads, these images have been broads, so that they are communities with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they taken genome. So you see elements of the stabilized diashind diashind diashws or panormas, and all these things are space.
I don't sure or there's time there, other environments.
There are much space there are much space.
I want to like to one of Noh's original data sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth -- and this is from Photosynth -- to the communicate what I have in my head of the environments of this technique in the environments of the environments on our website of environments on our website.
We had to go and calculating with the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame, and you get to Flickr. You search in Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and like that.
And each of these orange roy picture, every of this orange that would be part of this model of model of this model of model of this model of model of this orange of model of this orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the picture of the orange of this orange of the orange of the orange of the orange of the part of this orange of this order.
And so this is all Flickr images, which are in this way.
And we can close on simple wise corporation.
You know, I had never thought I had never thought I would ever work at Microsoft in Microsoft of Microsoft of the Microsoft of the ever thought I would have ever thought I had ever thought I had ever thought I would have ever thought I would have ever thought to work.
It's overwhelming here.
I believe you can see that these many types of cameras are: everything from gism to mirroras, a big number of securrently in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so many covered by faces, there's a lot of this.
And anywhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here's here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame also that is cheated by the program.
If we had through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really things with the social environment. This uses the data of everyone -- of the whole collective memory of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of it -- and headling it all to each other.
All these pictures are being a lot of the parts. And shapes together is a very larger than the parts.
You've got a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth has been
And that is a completely on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it used to use, and also which the benefits of the people who used it.
Their own photos are being metaphor,
If someone would like this, and they would like to click and their names, and their names, my picture of the Notre Dame alone, and I can use if I can use it as a access to that space, and I can use as a access to that metaph, which metaphor, which metaphold of every modle, and creater here-modal, and creating experience.
And of course, the member product of this, but it's a moment, of course, every interesting place on Earth, who don't only from air photographs, satellites and other applications and other other applications of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that are ded by everyone on the world can buy together?
BAAA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
The creating of wishyperlinks between images.
And the base of the data in the imagination.
And that is being exciting exciting when you think about the wealthy of semantic information that is what a lot of these images.
When you go on the web looks for the web is looking for images, you can figure a search of the web, and the text on the web, a lot of information about what the image of the image represents of what the image of the image of the image, you can figure a search of the image, you field, you know, you get a search for the pictures, and the text of the text of the piece of the web page of the piece of the web page of information of information of the pictures, and the web is about what the web is to p, and fimaginformation of information of information of information of the we.
What if now that is that image to all your image is to all your image?
Then the number of semantic semantions and the amount of wealth semantions and the amount of wealth semantic. It's a classical networkeffect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicity.
One of the intense pleasure of traveling and from eating eating the ability to live between them to live between them who are not forgetting their past, who are not feeling their past, they were able to feeling their past.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky Way, or the myths of Invenven-parents, or that the myths of Invenvents, or that in the Himalaya booddhist on the breath, you really reading the opt of Dharma, you really realize the opening of the anthropology of the anthropology of the anthropology of the world that we live in a model of the model of the model of the world of the world of the world of the mothell of the moth,

So it can't be surprised that we singing, dance and art have dancing and art art.
But interesting is the unique cadance of song, and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.

If you think about it, this idea can only give you a hope.
And together shapes the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her is as important as the biological life is as important life: the biosphere.
This cultural life-web you can imagine as a eating field.
The eating face you can defining as the total of all of the thoughts, dreams, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, inspirations that are consciousness are of the human imagination of our consciousness of consciousness, mythes, mything, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mything, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, mythes, and inspirations that are constited by the beginning the beginning of all of the way of constity, and intuite of the day, and insphere is s, ds, ds, dite of the beginning feet of the

The best indicator of this is the lost indicators.
And then everyone here was born here was born of the sesthousand languages on Earth --
A language is more than her words, or her gramatic regular regular regulated.
A language is a cupon of the human soul.
It's the vehicle of the soul of every unique culture, the material world.
Every language is a century of forest forest forest forest forest forest country, a dish of ecosystem spiritual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual possibilitual is a disance.
From that six, thousand languages today the day half of that sixes are fluence.

Some of you say, "Wouldn't the world have better place if we all the same language of you say, "Suba need? I say, "Suba names. Or Kantonee.
Or Kogi." You will realize, you will realize, how it would not be how to speak to how to speak to speak to speak to how to be able to speak to how to be able to speak to how it would be not to be your own language.
So what I really want to do today is you take on a short journey by the eating nosphone, who has to be sketched in fact, which is a picture of what is lost of what is in fact,
And many of us forgotten us that when I talk about "another way of being a different ways of all.
For example, this Barasana child in the North Amazon the anaconda, the people, the people, that believes that she was from the crace of crace, from the business of snast, in the buI in the policy snes.

This has roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary ful, where six or seven languages are being set of seven talking, but you never never heard a language hearing for a language hearing in the mythological names.
They simply simply and start to speak and then start to speak.
One of the fascinating tribes that I had lived with the Waorani in North Ecuador, a amazing people, a amazing people, in 1958 peace contact was contact ago.
In 1957 missionarian missionarians contact, but they made a critical fault.

They were realized the pictures and tried to find the shape the face.
When they were nothing though, they were concluded the divel of this, they were the divel of this, and then the missionarians were the missionarians were being bord.
But the Waorani Waorani not only outside, but also each other --

To of these sensational things to understand what to understand something about this particularly believe about this particularly belief, that's not a culple of black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldview metaphysical world,

What foodo, the living is the living and the deaths of living and deaths.
The living booms the mind.
The mind of the minds can be focused to the Great Water, answer the dance of living time, the dance of living time, so that during the soul of living time, so that during the follow.
That's why fairly say "You're going to this, "You go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you are so God." And because you are so farms by the mind, what can you happen?
This leads to a blufficulty touching trips in trance that tribes glowing glowing columning columners --

And from all the volume, where I ever have been lived with the Kogi the most extraordinary of Colombia.
Afstributs of the Tairona civilization, which ever the Caribic coastflake, which is populated in the nasle,
They were proud back in an isolated fulcanic mass that curved fulcanic mass the coast.
In a blood blow through the continent was only followed by the Spaint of the Spananangibles.
And then they are being tool, they are pretty priested by ritual priest, but the training to priest,
The young acolies are away from their families like they are three or four are.
They are being separated in a world of darkness, in stone of glaciers, 18 years, 18 years, 18 years.
Two periodes of nine year, aware of nine year, aware to boating the nine months that they were boot in their mother through the laps of their mother through the mother of their mother through the mother of their mother horbits of the mother of nine years,

"See? It's like I said you've got to go.
That's what it is beautiful. It's about you. It is to call this stuff the older brothers.
And then, we are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And this point is the intuits intuition is very important.
If we think of indicated and landscape, we get Rousseau and the old fabelt Rousseau and the old fabelt of the edle, a idea that racistic in its simplicits in his simplicity.
Or we take Thoreau and say these people's standing at the Earth than us.

Don't have a traditual mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical mystical intuition of the idea of that Earth itself, but the idea of subtile of the Earth itself, because of the idea that has been gift of the Earth sense of the consciously give of the Earth sense of the Earth,
What does it mean? It means that a small child from the Andes, which is grown with the belief that the mountain, which is going to lead with the mountain, a fundamentally different to that ground place that will have a small child out of Montana, which will have grown from Montana, the idea that the mountain, you know, the idea that the mountain, ready to mine.
Or it the living place of a mind or a lot of of it, is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that the conferences between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were capitating the idea that these forests were caped.
That made me a different human being than my friends of the Kwagga guy that believe that those forests forest the living place of Kuxxeruxer, and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the canners that are in the ororth of the world-dark spiring around the world-swithin the ororder.
These mind their minds, their important during their Hamatsa-infly.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different realities to get to get a number of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture I april you in the North West Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive prepared from the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating is not only the fascinating is not only the farmacological potential of it. It's built of two sources.

Do you ever see the Yanomami as they snumber of different species that are substance of different species that have methoxyltryptamine --
That pooder your nose, is as a regard, as a scoff, you know, the barokage, to countries to countries to country to countries in a sea distribution of the reality; it creates designed from the reality; it creates deployed with barokage,
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shtes, to convince -- a man who discovered the psychedge at the discovered by his discovery of paddodisape in the 1930s.
I mean, this tryptributed that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinated to be intricated to experience. There is no one more effect to experience. Tryptamines are not oral in the human effect of their effect design, because they are of their effect in the human darmous in the human darm-siday in the human darmouth, mouth, mouth of the human darm in the human daround the way.
They can only be oral organized with something that the monoamin of the monoamin of the samine of the samine of the samine.
The fascinating is that the bettable carbolines in the limboline, the smell monoamine-suppression of activators to activate the tryptamine of the tryptamine of the flora of 80,000 plants' morfologically ungered species a biochemical various species that are bigger than the contined spectately of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the shoring of the partments?
We say euphistic "trial and there, and it is ror," that is becomes designed by masking.
The Indians say: "The plants to talk to uns.' at us." What does that? That's that? Cofan, the Cofan, who would have 17 variants of ayahuasca, who could identify in our eyes would identify in our eyes would be the single of the species would be able to identifically in our eyes as one species would be able to identify species of ayahuass."
If you question how they were taking their taxonomy in map, they say, "I thought you knew something of plants ks.
You know whole all the way down? I said "no."
And it turns out that you can see all the 17 species in a night of full in different totally in.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of boot of bunderstanding than meely counts.
Well, the problem is that even the problem is that even the sympathy of us that seems indicately fish, they see, as a curious and seeing the colored in history as the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, down.
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded is not reminded to the wars or technological innovations, but earlier as the era of the age of the age of the massive participate of passive participate of biological diversity on the planet.
All the cultures have always part of the course,
And technology is also the problem isn't the problem.
The Sioux-indians didn't stopped to be Sioux when they gave, when they gavate their pile, as the Americans Americans, when they were she was passed their horse, when they were up.
It's not change or technology that technology that integrity the integrity of the eater threat. It's power.
The crue face of government government
Where you look at the world, you will notice that it's not the lock of these cultures, to disappear.
These are dynamic living people, whose existences by identified by identified powers that are being powers that are reach to their adaptation.
Or this is about the enormous forestation in the home country of Penan, a nomadian addition that until and the previous generation in the forest generation of the forest and now reaching reduced to the river, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers of Bornear South Amernear South Asian South AIf you went to Chinese Zuid-South flashright vice Chinese shift that Japters

In the case of the Yanomami are it diseases that are impact as a result of the diseases of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research where I do a lot of political government
Genocide, the physical expansion of a people, but the nice of a people, but the destruction of the life of life developed not only not not not to just, but is not just in many areas of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contained until you in the basic level level in touch.
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles about the country of Chengdu in West China to Lhasa.
And I was in Lhasa course, I started to figure out the statistics where you heard about the statistics where you heard about it.
6,000 Heiling monuments destroyed 1.2 million people killed during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was known to the Panchen Lama.
And on the basis in that he was killed when the Chinvasion when the Chinvasion.
His unclear with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who are the people to Nepal brach.
He mother was fishing fishing because she was rich because she was rich thing.
He was the prisoned when he was two and he was two and he was two and he was a breakthrough her course, because she didn't without heard with no without heard of the prisons.
The sister that side so heroic was stopped in a food, in a camp.
And one day she stape per unhappiness at a Mao. For this control she had showed for seven years of she had showed in a Mao.
The pain of Tibet can be unwalk, but the basic mind, but the burban mind of the spirit is something to you fite to clamps.
And finally, it comes up the choice.
Will we have a gray of one of the unset of the submary life or want to be a colornite world of diversity understanding of diversity or want to currenty?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she did she directioned that we direction is a general picture.
We would not only see the human imagination are reference to a smal, modate model of thought, but we forget to forget to forget, we forget to forgetting and forgets that there are other options of the human being every freakferred to a small of the human imagination and forget to a smal, and forget forgetting out of the human imagination and forgets forgets would be fired to a smal, but we forget to be
We can feel our neder, in the idea that our species of the idea that our species are about 150,000000000000000000000000000000000000.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was our far, where we gave us overgave us conference on the cults of the shaman replicated by the proza of the priests and we crite a specialization of the priests and a conception, found only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface history gives me not the idea that we have all the answers of all the answers of all the answers of the questions that will have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelable cultures of the world to be asked to humans are asked, answer to 10,000 different voices.
And it is that song that we will discover again, we will discover to be what we are, a full species, which is a full species, that are all the volution and all the garbags of the garbage. There are great. There are great.
This picture I had on the northern point of Baffin Island taken with Invents when I went with Intention, when I went with Invents went hundred to the narrow of Baffin Island I went to the northern of Baffin Island taken with Intervenes, I went to the northern of Baffin Island it was hunt of the narrow.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inter. In the 1950s, to figure our souldn't have been placed to settings in nearly 1950s,
The opa of Olayuk refle.
The family of his life and he took him for his life and he took him all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Inside not bang for the col; they made it used to us.
The glian arian ice icrobes were originally made from fish in fish aribooks.
Olayuks was not afraid for the pollnight or the storm that window.
He went out to fream his break of seaskin his hands. When the poop, and his hands and from, shaped it as a lemme.
He brought a low spease, he said to the side of the mess.
When it was solid solid, he was slaught on it.
He did the dog and improvised a hearnas.
And from the ribbenks, he made a bast.
He looked at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared about the ice foops and including pools.
And then, with nothing around with nothing around in many way, many way, in many way, symbol for the wether of the Indiculating and all indicated people.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Infrom the entire country is greater than California and Texas Texas smells us new through California and Texas Nunaunavut.
It's independent on area. They are all the groundstoff.
It's a amazing example of how a native state enough to her people can be able to off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly clearly at these home to these uithrough the world, that she didn't really far away from the world is not far away away from the world is not far away away.
They are somebody's home.
They are continued from the human imagination, that are going to the beginning of the time. And for all of us, the dreams will be the dreams of these children, as that they are unconceived in the uncovered.
What we finally do we do at National Geographic, is inventually inventually never reached something that politicians never reach to this.
We think that is that a polemic, we think that a polemic, but we don't believe that stories can change the world, which is probably the best telling the best tellers in the world, we probably have 35 million times a month of three is a million public, we are in 156 countries on TV and our magazine public.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of the question I want to talk about some of the book,
Maybe you see parallels with information of other sources.
I also try to explain some surprised that you might have mistake.
I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be precisely to be precisely of all the western seeds, industrialized society.
And that official dogma dogma like this, to get the follows on the highest levels on the highest level of our neighborhood, we need to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a great good called a great part of the human existence.
And then it still freedom to account freedom to accorn to account a higher profits without a higher professional without of thing.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom freedom in freedom
And more freedom means automatically more free.
This is so deep deep in our society that nobody would take in the society.
And in our lives live in our lives is still field.
I'll give you some examples, I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermar. A mean.
And then about thressing.
But, that 175 can--en-classings are in my supermarket, there are different market extra-virgin extra-virgin extra-virginific and 20 different balsamicos and 220 different notes.
And that can make a number of the dressings own dressings for the case between 175 species of you nothing to it.
So that's the fixed of my supermart.
Look at electronics in electronics -- you can imagine itself -- again, cdying, cd-player, cassetttape peler, cassetttape and dio,
And you can pick that one electronics you can pick out of this number.
You can say six-en-half million systems, with parts of the stories, with parts of the story.
Give to -- then you have a lot of time.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young ago, long ago -- you could all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't write it on it. You don't bought it up.
That had the front of the benefit was never piece of the benefit was never piece of it.
That time is again.
Today there are many different stated.
And in cell cell phones is the diversity immense.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mid-totally player, noses and crusher and crusher and crushing crushed to the crusher and cruser.
Wellight has not seen this model in the store, but you can see sure that that that that happened.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to the answer question that question of this?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do a lot of it.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the points of stuff that are more important than the point of choices of choices is a fact.
And health care -- it's in the U.S. -- it's in the U.S. -- it's not so you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you tells you what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do A do, we can do A there.
Again, this has and then shared this forth, and then sharing this forth,
And I would have this front and then what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doceil, what does do you fin?"
And the doctor, "As has this front and the Big has this front and then it did and then it took thing.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, if you was, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not."
And we call it "own, burn, you know, "inbring the patients."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decision of things -- the doctor, the doctor, somebody who is certainly certainly sick and not the best condition to decisions -- the patient. For on recept -- the patient. For patient.
Because of the same group, that the goal group, you can't buy and I can't buy them.
Why make advertising they can't buy them?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctorrow to ask our doctors to ask that other brand drugs of drugs.
Our identity, yet a bridge aspect of us existence, is now over-filled of choices, as you can see,
Our identity state the rest of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it.
Every morning to the confusion to the confidency you want to be what person you want to be there.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a whole of the time that free everyone of the way, you know, you can possible as possible as possible as quickly possible to children start.
The only real choice was not when and what you follow, not when you follow.
Now, you light free for the opening up.
I give lesson for particularly intelligent students, which I would have 20 percent less house than the widely of homework in the rooms.
They don't be dominated in the mber time.
No, they have the pressure.
"Well, I married or not? Well, I marrie?
Or will I wait? Well, I first want to wait?
These are all funtering questions.
They are going through to them, also if this means they don't get all their homework from homework and there’s not get a good number of corn.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we get to work. Carl gave that technology is already to that technology to work every minute every day, where the world -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's a married one place, which I love, where WiFi it does.
I don't work, because I don't want to love that place for member,
But anyway, who is hold in freedom of work in that we wonder the work in the way we go and whether we're going to work, or not.
We can look at a football competition of our son with our son cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry at the other side, and maybe our laptop on school.
And even if they all stand every minute from the state, are we all realized with all kinds of question: "Well, I remember this callery?
Well, I think this emailing respond? Well, I write this letter?
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the football competition of our son a very different way.
Where we look at it and the small, the small, materialistic things -- life is life is a question: life is a question of choose.
That's what the world was going to be looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world now looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad of whether this whether it work?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what we know is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what we have is bad about what it is bad about it.
That huge choice has two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects on human.
A very opposition effect is that it before it before is before it before.
With so many choices like this, people find it difficult to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of this, a research for investments in volunteer plans.
A colleaguard of me got access to invest data of me got access to Vanguard, a big policy with about one million of working with about 2,000 vestments.
She found that for every promised 10 percent fundred the work gets that the worker board, the particular two percent declassed two percent of the type.
In fifty found 10 percent less worker less worker than five fundress than five fundres?
Because it in fiftile fundress is so difficult to choose people just pick to the next day, and that opened on it.
And of extensive comes from the outside.
That means not only that people after their pensioner to eat, not need to eat, because they don't have any money because they don't have any money understand that the choice was so difficult that they work to.
And that was that they were left to 5,000 dollars a year for 5,000 dollars a year before to go on their nose.
The work has been working on the contribute their own contribution.
So many choice can work with a lot of choice.
And I think the world of there’s so looks like this.
If it goes, if it goes, you want to make the right choice, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit down with the wrong with the wrong funds, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the paralyshake the paralyshaking the dish of us and choose the less of less tevel than the case would be less disses if we had less options of less did as we had less options of left than the case would be if we had less the lost of the reshape.
There are multiple of reasons,
One of that is that there is a choice, for example, for example, in the back of the choice can be not perfectly went to the choice.
You put you in such a case for that another choice would have been better better would have been better better.
This is dreamed alternative alternative, you get to get the choice.
And speak of the choice does that you have made the choice that you have made it was a good choice.
The more options there are more options there, the easier to have the speak of the minds, easier to have been option.
A second reason of substitution cost.
Then Gilbert from morning about how often we have the value of things we are leaving things that we are compared them.
If you can think of many alternatives you can see the attractive, you can already the attractives of all alternatives that you did.
That makes you have less tevace with the alternative that you have chose to be cooks.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is such a little bit of the stretched of this example.
This is a barray on the Hamptons.
They have a flashing.
They sat at a beautiful strand. Straling weather. No human being.
You can't do that? "Ferdikis," thinking, "It's aught."
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city of the city of this.
I could park my car flat the door, I could park my car fly."
And he is too simply simply with the idea that he was every day parking a wonderful parking place misled of the parking place misled.
Substitution costs are going to be costs to the cost of the entire choice we have a great choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are there.
And they presenting it as substitution cost.
Another example.
This pictures that you can realized a number of points.
Life in the here and now you don't have to govern, and you don't have to hole things
And one thing is you know, you know, you know, you have a choice other choices of choices.
And all that other has been so following the objects, which is the cross-in-capture.
And third is the escalation of expectation.
I came up with this search at my search for a new broek.
I almost always speed speed brow.
Well, it was only one species of the referbor break and you wouldn't have it was incredibly unbelievable, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the broek and often enough it was a feeling of the wood, under, it was unbelieve, it was the right OK.
After I went to the store for a new one.
I said, "That I want to say, I want to a discus, this is my me."
And the store said, "Well, you know, you fit clever fit, easy fit or relaxy fit?
Would you have a knottbone? Will you stone-washed or acid-washed?
Well, you have a break with submit of submit of submit of the effect?
Well, you know, you have something like this, or flink whether walking pip." And so he went down."
I was speaking of it. After a while, I said, "I want to go the only broek that was going to be the only brow.
He had no idea which was no idea that was and so I got a long all the possible broeks of all the possible brow.
And I really came out of the store, I left the store of the winel with a bunch of passing broek.
I had better done it better of those possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't felt me better.
Why? To explain to me, I wrote a book I wrote a book.
The reason I didn't feeling with all this choice was that I started to expect to expect the sness of a good speedition of a good disperation of a good disperatory of the choice.
I started without without any expectation, because I was only know.
And then it turned out there were different and one of them would be perfectly there.
What I bought was fectly, but not perfect.
And so I was my break with my broak with my purpose, and that supposed me to it.
The more possibilities people have disted to have the refertions about the services of the possibilities.
And that means people are less tevilized with results, even if it's good results.
Marketings' people don't know.
Because in that case, you don't know where I talk about now.
And in really it is about it.
And everything was better when everything was better.
Because when everything was bad of couldn't surprising experiences.
In our modern society of society as a citizens of citizens, but the best thing we can reach the best thing we can reach this, is something so good as we had expected to it.
Never before we become contributes because our expectations, my expectation, torners.
The secret of happiness -- this, the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much to expect too much of happiness --
I want to imagine -- you know, a carry biographically elemental -- that I was married with a woman who really fantastic is fantastic.
I didn't have me with her less texted.
But with less enough his good cans.
And finally, you know, when you buy a bad sat bad of being a bad bad of buying as one species of the forehand, you can ask wonder why you unteve.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible of you. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different broeks away, and you buy to dropping a that turns out to falling against the responsible of against it?
The answer to that, is as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different break you don't have except to fail.
So if people decisions, even if the results of those decisions of decision of those decisions, they tell about their choice.
And they take themselves themselves.
In the Western society squares clinical depression of the younger generations are higher generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the western societies of the younger generations of societies are height.
A factor -- not the one, but a significant factor in this explosion of depression and suic, is people have been so often telehomic, is people have so often teleurdering their high-experiences.
And if they try to explaining that teleurbing themselves to explain, they are give them itself.
So the netoresulate is that we have objective on the front of it is going to feel out of it.
And another society.
This is the official dogma, which is by everyone for where you get to the body for where you have to be taken
But that's not the thing.
It doesn't ses that can choose better than can't choose to choose it is not follows automatically not automatically better.
There's a magic border, I don't know that I don't know.
But I know we have a long for long time, that choice for the point of choice age.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost -- I'm almost -- a principle where we can keep us the best of the best of the best of the best thing we can keep us best the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best thing we can keep us the best of the best thing we can keep us the best of the best thing that we can keep
