Forally I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, which was the pool, who was the pool, who had the past three million years of the vast three million years with 40 percent of the United States of the United States of the United States,
But this is the nest of this specific problem because it doesn't have the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of ice showing the ice.
The ice of the North Pole, in a certain in a sense of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what the past 25 years is happening to the past 25 years
The permanently reported in the red.
Like you see it from the dark blue.
That's the year, it is the major of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The solim permanent, five years or parent, or parent, is almost like blood, that from the body is solid here.
In 25 years is the from this to this is a little bit of this is to this in the way.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern Icell and there are a very large amount of front of frozen woman is frozen cools -- when it was death, when it was a big.
Comman with the total amount of the total amount of the atmosphere, that could be redubbles that could be required the amount of point that can reflect the engineering point of the atmosphere.
In some undeep deep in Alaska borrely methane in the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another ondive to another ondie-deep more.
Why! She's OK. The question is a chick or we will be able to be that well.
A reason for that, this huge is this huge called Greenland from the north-wrong from the north.
This is a smell twatriver.
The watervolume is echer than echick it greater than equires
This is the Kangerlussian river,
If you want to know how the sea lot of the sea because it is the landies is the place is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea --
These stroming these flu.
On the other hand, on the other sized on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months of reported scientists that the entire continent now a negative ice balance --
More specific is the ice, in the west, of the South Pots, with the name of the meltilancands.
The entire continent to six meter seases a lot of seeing --
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after biggest ice massa, there are new now, who were a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the help of his drink water of that melerate melers.
In the Andes, is this glester the bron of drinkwater for this city of drink water for this city of drinking this city of drinking the Andes,
There are now more stroys.
But when they disappedisappears also the drink water.
In California was a reducation of 40 percent in the snowed of the Sierra.
It comes in the water-reservoices.
And as you could read his front of the predictions are nstige.
This global dream taking a behavian a-big-foot fuel of fun fuel of fun fun fun of fun fun of fun
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never see a radial and never see a fastly fastly and never see a fastly fastly and never see a lot of nature.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely untextable.
If you look at the botttook a historic context of a historic context of what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 degreen every 24 hours every 24 hours every 24 hours every 24 hours every 24 hours --
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, Kook at the eye area of the Stille Ocean, from America, and on every south, and on every south, there's a drastic dygen in the ocean in the oceans.

And there was a lot of more support carbon centrales a lot more support.
But we see a circumult.
These are the supported carbon the cools of the bited in the last years, and where bigger alternatives were alternatives were rested in the last years.
There's a political fighting to the political freedom.
The urban carbon and oil industry gave 250 million dollars to promotion, 250 million dollars to promots, which is a re-cool cool of the environment.
And that image was doing something like this.
And the guy was the guy in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion gallons of gallons of gallons of galler.
You probably see it in the news of the news of the news
This is the one after a biggest fall, in America.
This was happened around the Kerst.
One of the adversies of the cities of the city-coodustrial around the Kerst was a dead.
Video: ""Frosty the voice, a stage, a stage, a croad, a croad.
He's fluence here in America, and he care in America, and he care growth our economy grows.
Frosty the support carbon the day becomes a day screen.
He's paid and well-scate, and employees their bit."
Here is a big part of the city-coal in West Virginia of daan.
The biggest minction is the great biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwheship of me be clear Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Pelosi, Harry Reasy Pelosi, they don't know where they have it talked about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimate,
This is a piece of a purpose of a thir.
Video "Bue COAL, we see the climate change, we see the climate change.
That's why the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a gigantic to refer a bigantic to the light and the regulls of the truth of the truth of cities.
Feit is, steal is not smart.
We find that the scance is -- and it run a cope cook.
So, you don't make a climate change.
Let me just about our survive.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a looking at this hypermodern croze,
Fantastic! The machines make a very very kind of lays.
But that's the sound of a scale cooly.
And despite the fact that the branches of the most important orders of the most important orders of the Earth is changing the Earth is the remarkable of the Earth is the scene of the Earth,
Look a look at the beautiful cooly of today.

Video: I, America selling in crisis, the national security of the national security of climate crisis.
The rock of all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and healthy collabored oil,
But now there's a purpose to get a new solution to get out of this.
Forth America of 100 percent of scale electricity within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to work on the work of a plan us and the rewarming warming the Earth recently.
And inally, a solution that replaces that enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our tape of the
Al Gore: And the last thing.
Video: I, It's about America to give America to give America.
One ways to make a end ways to make a end of our dependence of old break to our planet, they have our planets that our planets to help our planet.

We have to go far far and fastly fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reflected back to a update about how that machine works.
So here I am a lot of the deals who don't waren't waren't the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever taken in the engineering in the engineering in the engineering in the engineering in the enominal experiment.
It has to reduce the engineering that were less than a billions that were less than a billions of second after the universe was started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine Genevil.
We took photos of that less Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLASSTLAS detector -- 44 meters in the diameter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the scale.
And at 10 september we put the machine for the first time we put the machine for the first time
This photograph was called ATLAS.
That carried to a partnership,
It's a photograph of the first particle that help around the LHC ging, and with a footest with a piece of the LHC, which is foot in the detector in the detector in the detector of the detector of the detector of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine working the machine is a huge consider.
I don't know if this the biggest across or this is a biggest to Google and saw that the Internet page of saw up the Internet pages of saw up so on.
That means we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what was doing with these golden behaviors.
And those behaviors of a thousand amper craised the machine on full force working on full force
The engineers will say, "Not true you, "Not true.
They can do that because they superago, they can do supersive temperatures.
So on min 27, colder than the space between the stars, that can be able to behaviors that behaviors that behaviors that behaviors can be a bunch of the stars, that behaviors that behaviors that behavis can be a bunch of the degrees that behavior.
In one of the connections between the neine of the nex-magnets in the LHC, a constructive old
And it was a little bit a following something warmer, and there was intended to 13 thousand cample of a thousand camps.
This was the result.
This is more including if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets were replace.
We civilized about 50 magnet.
We had to get them out out of it, what we did it.
We all revully.
Now, they are back to wead.
Eind murbs the LHC again in the engineering
We will expect it and we expect it and we expect it in juni or not, so we can go to figure out with the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, that have been doing unhappiness the debate of the scientific rew scientific research research of scientific research of the scientific research of the scientific research have been doing it.
I think it's a little bit that it's so hard to be a little more than the fact that we go go away to be the LHC.
I was a let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have been destroy to be the deaths of his life's living to the considered Michael Farael, this is so dangerous for the human mind to take the progress of human mind that our images of the human mind that our images of science that there are not a mysteries in the nature, that there are not a new mememories of the world that there are not a new world in the world in the other other words of the world in natural scientisterstersterions of course that there are that there are that there are that there are that there are that there are that there are that there are not wellelling of the last words are not wellell-incist that there are the last words that there
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask with you back to your children at your children, when you play with blocks at a block of blocks
When you discovered how to graduate it to gray them and walk and wood, you know, you actually have a problems of the conscious relationship with the space relations.
Ruimtely insight is destrong is a deal with the world to understand the world
If an information with objects with objects with objects with objects with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- and my fishing Jeea of Kalanii -- what we could use a computer -- what we could -- what if we could use a computer that are a kind of digital vingly wire that are re-finger to a plate vinger that the confounds of the information that we can reaudority to the information with the influence with the inspire of the information of the information of the information that we could we can can can can fount of information with with with with with with with with with with with with with with the way to have a fount with the inspired red red red red red red red red red red information with the ney with objections
and ordering ordering as we want?
And these questions us so far we decided to figure out a answer by building Siftables.
Cort collabors is a Siftable to a a size a a cooky.
They can be move with the hand they can feel their movement detect detect and they free a screen and they free a screen and wireless to the shead.
The nuclear is the physical hands are blocks as blocks can be removed by grabs to graduate the blocks to graduate it.
And the fronth Siftables a new ecosystem for the ways of the ways to manipulate the ways of digital information.
And that these help-aid resources a more physical different, are conscious and even from their each other, and even from each other, and even from the way we are different new and interactons of interacties of the interactons of the interactons of their interactons of the interactons of their interactons of their interactons of the other
I will start with some simple.
This Siftable is instituated a video to tell a video to reach a video to play and other other and other care playing and other crazy --
These interactive portraons are conscious.
Indians narely considered each other, they will be interest in the other other interests.
If they also get up to the engineering them and can be a little bit of a major.
And they feel them movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interactive, the use of these interactive, the use of the interactive, the use of the interactive, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a fluid of the fluid of the whether was a fluid of the interactive,
In this example of three Siftables emmers to go and I can use them to a color in a very very much to go to a color in a very very much as well.
If we have been frunning back to the back back back to the back back of the back of the back of the time.
There are some crippe possibilities for the education, mathematics with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give the possibility things that we want to give the possibility of the immediately,
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple, by a simple,
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of a willly re-a-such of Siftable, and principilled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and a differently, a new series of crazy mobilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in a a bunch them to make it and make a video of it.
They were really away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of these approach is that people almost not almost not instructions to be instructions
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exact what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the testing of the tests.
That's our botta tester big.
And it seems that he was a cell tables lived in the Sifttables lived
For him this was just block up the only blocks.
Here is a interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carakters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters of the table,
Here he shows the sun up of this is going to come up to the sun
Video: The sun comes up up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
God d! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the narrow of Sifttables and the narroads to respond to each other, World Waw!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story.
and he decided how it is a bit.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example I will show show you today a synthesizer and music child and music child player and music in the lead, where every Sifttables like the lead, basic and drum.
Eengineer, four variation, where you can choose you can choose what you want to use
These sounds can be injected in a very very much in the pattern to be injected to be able to determined the pattern itself in a sense.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a very very very much of a very very much of a lot of controll, and filter.
They are going to a sound and provided by a sound and accessive by change.
And the almost of the almost effects like tempo and volume that are are supplied on the entire pattern.
Let's look at least we look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, a first pattern.
Now, I instead I read the basline
Video: Well, I feel a little batch a battacks.
Video: And now I buy the filter of the filter of the print, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can get it very quick by the office block block block of the tempo block blocky.
Video: DM: Now I head the filter of the bas for a little more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescue the pattern as it played a little bit of the plays.
So I don't have to plann, but I can improvise everything and make it very longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the end, it was the animals of the name of the volume Siftable to left.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make a new people, my passion of new people, which our brains that are better interfaces that our brains and bodies and bodies working on the way our brains and body working board.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of the engineering of a copy possibilities that we develop developing in the lab.
The thought I I want to bring about is that this only the atsize is a very new generation of helping to the interactions with digital media, which is the information of the information of our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with all of you all to talk to you
I'm writing.
But, write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My entire life for a long life for write and I don't think that will change change
And yet, there's something happened in my life and career in my life and career and career my relationship to my relationship to my work to see my work to see my work was re-in-re-re-re-in-re-re-re-in-re-re-re-re-recently re,
It started a book that I wrote on a book a memoire: "Ets, Biddom, Beminnen," Beminnent, Beminnent, which was very in the world was going to be the world and an international exists were word.
And the sequence is that people have to remember, and always do I do mean to me as if I do a med.
And we do a little bit -- member!
People come to me and ask me and ask me and ask you don't have a success that you can't have this success to evenar?
Don't you care you going to be able to write your entire life will never be a book a book a book that people are going to write to be a book a book in the entire life will write to write your entire life will write to write a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a
Don't you have a big.
Erough distitution, you know,
Of course, that would be very very of, I remember about 20 years ago, I was a teenaged 20 years ago, I was a teenager,
People said, "Don't you get success you don't have success to get succes?
Don't you care to deal to reflect by such a such of goo?
Don't your life to be a life to this work that there are a lot of front of something out of the things that you will have to be able to deal with your bitter-bitter-bitter-bit?"
It’s in that stretation.
In the short comes to this questions on this this: "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough that are enough of things that are enough
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things afterterns don't know what it was a lot of other things.
For sea wheart of the other things.
But what is writing to write the last time that the last time that come froad.
Is it ration?
Is it a logic that somebody is avers to be a job to their mention on Earth are to their mention on Earth are se?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of the mind thing to others at the other species are not going to happen.
Take my father. He was a scale enious, and I can't remember me that there was in the 40 years he was working on him to him that he was working on him or he was not afraid to be at the time.
And so of course, "Yohn, how is it with your chemist?"
No, no, so there was not about it.
To fair behind to be a little bit of the centuries have been not the reputation of the reputation of manicic depressive coholists to be cheaps.
Scheat, who have a reputation.
Not only writer, other creative people have been able to be the reputation of people, the reputation of people.
Look at the grimmy dozen under the most magnife creative minds the 20th century.
Many fellow young, often by own access.
And even the deal of that not suicidenly under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be a
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey every book is a piece of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit about your life-living life work.
But of this kind of excrazy.
We all heard it all earlier and have it been accepted with it was a little bit of it.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is unlosed with list and that a poor and that a artist-in-finally read to read to read to read to elended up to election.
And that's why I want to ask everyone here today you know, can living a life?
Do you do that?
Because I think about it think, I think about it is not a very well-daught thought.
I think it was a little bit of the way.
And also even dangerous
I wouldn't like this century is so good.
We can creative mind to live a lot better attace to live.
I know sure it to me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be to life-day.
Scer the fashion my career now.
Go too, I am a little bit of a teacher at a lot of it.
I can be four decades to work on the four decade.
And the Hoogs will be all the way I publiceer by the outside world as the work that following the work that extraordinary book.
We are with friends under the gale, so I can wellalk up to the high of the biggest success my biggest success of the biggest success.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think if you think about it is a lot of the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be a working with the work I like to work I like this.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after long after a long time I think I can only go to the conclusion that I can just write a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the country.
I have to create the write of a securious distance between mitself and my survive and my survive and my survive and my future of future publications.
I went to ways to do that.
I am in the history and I do in the history and reflect me in other civilizations to see or others a better way to help people to help to help people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been born me to the old Greeks and Romined Greets and Rom.
Let me because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Green old Greeks and Romined people not that creativity was a creativity of themselves,
Men beliefed that creativity was a god-didsible to the human beings to the ments were going to be making fage and unknowledge of the people,
The Greeks called this crazy called this involvity "demons."
And Socrates beliefed he was a demon that he had a demon the words influistered him to refluist.
The Romenents had a kind of idea.
And in them was a such a guy creative memory a geni."
And the graph is that the Rombs with a genion, not a particular person to be a pienced pienced a pienced person with a genion.
In their policy was a genius was a magic godable entities that were re-hurting in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobviously in the house of the house.
If the artists was a refun assistance.
And he was a shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first one of the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work works.
The artists was so in protection called called called "A lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant working on the front of the eer.
Everybody knew that a invisible genius had taken away from them.
Where's a working your work -- you know, not only do you know, not only about you.
Everybody knew you had a pretty one.
Lange time is that was described how in the Wests creativity was described
When the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed
And there was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the individual point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weather, and it stuff from the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People beliefs that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history was about artists said that they were a genius and not that they were a genion, and not that they had a genion.
I have to say I think I have to say a great front of a big front of the wrong.
To one person, one one single individual to believe that he or she or she or she whether they were the essentially mysterious mystery, the bron of the century of everything that creative and the known for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in the sun of the sun
Ego's read to be read to gigantic proporations and there are unprestently requires to prestones.
And I think this drug has been making the last 500 years of artists of purpose of poor
And if that's the question is, and I think is the question: "What do is "What do is that?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old back to a old understanding of the relationship between the ments and creative mysteriod?
Maybe not.
Welliving 500 years we can rational malism in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speech.
And it probably in the audience people who are reduced scientific scientific diverse of the idea that elphenomenon the idea that elphenomenon the work of poorest the work of artists to inspiring to inspiring high-temporary tes to inspiring the work of the ards of the things that are actually bring the work of artims.
It doesn't seem to me like you all in that I'm going to get to be in that.
And yet, I wrong.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought not to be a day?
And it is just so much as much as all the other explains as all the other exction, making uncle of the uncle of the creative process.
Everybody has to create something -- so everything -- so in fact, so in fact, all the axy here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process --
And it sometimes it feel a paranorms.
I have the great American clothese, the great American dichore Stone of the wire of the
They are dealing in the nine. Her entire life they write all writing them close.
She told me about her youth on the plate,
Sometimes, if she was a felt on the work was a felt one, it heard of the country.
It was so said, whether there was a big golf air.
And so a golf of golfing over the country to her and
She felt the ground her foots started to scue her at that moment and knew her at that moment to do a little bit of a thing to do to her life's life's lifes.
She running to home, and they had to get the closer and they had to be as quickly and paper.
When it was closed by her hunt her hand her her only office to write it was to write it on the way to write it was to write it was a crazed by her hundred of a wave of her hundred of her hundred by her hundred by her hundred by her hunting to write her her hunted to write her hun
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then and ring six, but calculate it doesn't reach it doesn't reach it
And at the time, it was welling the night, it was focus on the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a other pounds.
And I think it was a lot of them -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were close to be closed the nice of the story --
And then she was looking for it was looking for paper and paper, and paper, it was closed by her him and paper.
Juist at that moment she had a potased to pay a potased to painting.
And with her other hand, so she told me me me them, she plured it out of the air.
She paked it to his tail and it back in her body back in her body, it back in her body,
In those cases came up to the animal where, in my beautiful in a paper, but in the engineered follow.
When I thought I was thinking -- what I think -- what accident, my creative process my creative process of creative process of creative process is a little bit of the --
And this is my creative process no! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which every day every day on the same time on the same time and flowing and define with blood, swood and transformed by blood.
But even in that daily I had a little bit of the experience of experience.
You will also be able to know it as a crazy that there creative ideas in your reflect from a bron that you can identifying impossible to identify as as possible to identify as a way to identify of a bongs from a bunch of the ideas in itself.
What is that then we bron?
How can we use it without that we have bee?
And in a way that we do a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think is musiciance Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine of a magazine.
We had it government about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life was showing the concluding the meant of the majordinary that is tried to get to the uncontains of the unconcern creative impulsable creative impulse in him him to be able to reflect him in him of his re-fashion the in-instance,
With the Tom was a little bit more rustiger.
And one day he was a day he in Los Angeles on the speed and changed the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of a day and changed the process of a day
And as he was so he heard a fragment, he was a crazy of a melodie.
The decided him, like inspiration that do is a father, ungrab, crope, crope, crowd.
It was a beautiful melose and he wanted to fash.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper to a paper at a touched at a touched at a time.
The well-known speaking back to the bottom, "I got the meloic, and then stay the meloice, and then it stays me behind me behind me remains.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it for."
He didn't get a bunch in panic, but he stopped that entire human, and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he was hearing and said, "Sorry heart you can't see that I sat up a hour?"
"Do you really know that I can write a song?
If you really want this songs to be a later later, you have to reflect when I have time for you.
And not a little fally.

Every degrees ago, there were in the North African woostine people together to dancing to mail to dancing to dancing on the healthy music.
And Urings and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always amazing because the dancers were fullly.
But sometimes happened to something like it happened something called a bunch a bunch of it.
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you know about what I mean, you know, you have ever been seen something like a performer.
It was as if the time was stillistood and the dance of a poor.

June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had this projects about a couple of these projects, about the human genome and what it can meaning new sets of genome and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started a new point, we were the biology of the digital issues, and now we try to go from those digital code to a new fashion the biology to a new fashion the design and synthesizing of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of ases.
"What's life?" is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels in different level.
We tried to reduce different approach, it bring to least less components.
We are now almost 20 years of the digitalizing of digitals
When we were sequence, we had sequence, it was from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask regenerate regenerate regenerate regenerate to create the digital universe of this digital univers?
This is the card of a little organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genitself can be follow-follow in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a laboratory of a laboratory of a laboratory of a little thing, M
And we tried to look at whether we can get a little little call.
We can take hundred of hundred genes from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolic card, is that relative is simply simply reach to the including one.
Geluncle me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at all the genes is very unlives a living cell this was a living cell to be a living cell to all the genes of the genes that would reach a living a living cell to all the genes of the genes that would be a living a living cell of the genes that would be a living cel
We decided to be the only route to be the only route to synthesize this chromosphere so we could devide the components to be a few fundaments to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the components to ask this chromosphere.
And so we started asking asking questions like "Can we started a chromos' synthetis?
Staat the chemistry it to make these very large molecules we never have been going to have before.
And, if we do that, if we can do a chromosh "rest?
A chromosh is a chemical including a chemical including material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is required on exponential evidence of the digital wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code of the genetic slowly slowed slowed slowed a slow-sized slowed slowed a slow-a-slowed slowed a slow-a-slowed slow-a-slowly sing a genetic code of gen
And our last point it would put it on a exponential curve.
We started to start with a 15 years ago.
There were a number of stage for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical acction to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard to be a very hard.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making to 50 letters in length, so it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the things make more fold it.
So we had to make a new method to foot these little pieces and the core of all the fold of all the fold of all the fold fold of all the fold of the wrong of the wrong of the wrong of the old of the wrong of the collabors of the corrigate of the little pieces of the point of these little pieces
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little frus that bacteria box.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began to a chemical chemical stant chemical stunes and the bacteria and the bacteria called the genetic code and virtually make the genetic code,
The viral particles were going to be taking out of the cells, they came back and then they came back and box the E. coli.
I was a conversation with the oil industry, and I said to be a model but I said to well.
They laught more than you love.
And that's why we think this is a situation that is a situation in a biological heardare a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial bacterial chromospher.
That's more 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes that we could pull the cassettes
to understand what the deeply components of a living cell cell
The design is critical is critical information in the computer than to do with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accuraight.
When we first assumped this genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard of a 10,000 base-patient a 10,000 basepares.
And finally we found the resequencing of 30 followed the original sequence of the original sequence than it was not in the war of the war
And our part of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters are a long that have to contain with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build a little bit of the sub-simply to build together.
We design in this is unique in the fact in the fact of the unique of the unique of the unique here.
Maybe you can have a read that we put water-waters.
Bedition, we have a four genetic code: A, C, C, GG.
Trios of those cos for the bunch for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attace for every aminozored for every aminoxygen of the aminozored for every aminozurs for every aminozurs of those of letters for every aminozurs of those of letters cos of those of letters
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words in the way.
Aantly, we just assumpt to be a lot of cigious
Some of them were not disasted that there were no dissease.
We have these pieces so designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms they reparts and put them into each other.
And we started to make pieces of square with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have a pieces of 24,000 letters, to 72 -- to 72 to 7,000.
In every clium we could move a flowing of these stuff so we could sequences them because we could create a process that will create a process -- that will be very robuying you see.
We try to reach the point of automaticize the point of automaticians.
So this is a basketbalfine.
And as we get to the really big piece of the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basement -- they don't grow as easily more in E.
That explains the most of all modern tools of the modern biology.
That's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-recombination is used by biology to reach DNA to repartment, which can foot themselves, that can feet.
Here is an example of this.
And there's an organized Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation that three million radiation of straling on can.
You see in the top of the top pane, shed mosphere is just a chromosphere.
12 ots 24 hours later he was going to go to each other, exactly as it was first time to be exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organizes that around.
These organizes can be been dried to be followed in
They can live in a vacuum of life.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in the space can provide a new aquatic environment, a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show you that there is many of the way,
Here is a kind of microphotograph of the molecule that we made with this processes -- actually actually created with the right mechanisms with the right design.
And it is a care that they feed automatically foot carry.
This is not an electron-microscopphoto; this is a froscopphotograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we were exciting unlanguage.
This is more 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule weight is more 300 million.
If we would be able to a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, there's 142 pages of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 142 pages of the genetic code with a 142 pages of the genetic code with a 10-points
Now, how do we started, how do we started a chromosphere? How do we do it it?
With a four-is it is a clear easy.
With a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler when you give you eukaryots, like eukaryots, like whether you know the cell and do, and that's what you know as the clones.
And in the bacterious species is the bacterial is integrated in the cell but we have unlong-long time that we can see a full transpline of a chromosopm from a cell to a other, and the activation.
We have a chromosquitole, and south of a microbs.
These are about that are about so far as people and mics.
We foot what extra genes to take a chromosh to this chromosquitoes.
We have the response to make all the eggs all the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will will be very eveny avanced graphical images here -- the new chromosopm was a new chromosh in the cell of the cell of the cell --
We even thought he would come to come to come to sover the process what would come to develop the process what was going to develop the process of the process of a process what would be going to developed a process to develop the process of the process of it would be a process to develop the process what would come to develop the process what would come to move to be a process what would come to move to develop.
This is an evolved.
We found all discovering all kinds of the kind of chromospher, or a third or a third of third or a third of thousands of the species.
People who evolution is evolving evolution as if there are not a lot of biology doesn't have a lot biology biology
There are enzyms that restrictive enzyms are enough called DNA restrictive DNA restrictimes.
The chromosome that in the cell was not easy.
The cell -- the chromosphere -- well, we put in in it.
It was express the other chromosphering the other chromospher, and the other chromosphere, and so we had the cell with the new chromosophim.
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the one species of the one species of the new species of the new species of areas in the new software that we had in the cell we had stop.
All the members changed the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed to change the genetic was changed.
This is a major of a genomical alchemist, but we are in the power of the software DNA, to change things fundamental to change things fundament.
Good that this is not a little bit of the Cambranching -- this is a whearing of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid a new kind of evolution, and I paying a new kind of consider the Cambric explosion where there are making a new species of the Cambranched design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear when you look at what you need is a little bit of it.
We're going to influence from six-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context of 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us that in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years that there are four four four.
We have to food with food with food of clean water, medicine, medicine, brandstone for the six-a-half billion.
That's a little to do that for nex.
We use five billion ton coals, more than 30 billion of folloor.
That's 100 miloons of fath hone.
When we take biological processes in ogency or or whatever process than to replace; then it is a huge process that a huge challenge
And then of course, there's all these carbon dioxide of the stine that in the atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have a database of about 20 million genes, and I would like to be a databased as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is present out of the diversity that is prevented there is from the diversity that there is present a dead of diversity that is front of the diversity that is from the diversity that there is from the diversity that there is from the diversity that there is that there is from the diversity that that there was going to be out of a
We are predicted by a biological reality and our excitement and our imagination.
We have techniques of the technique synthesesemethods to combined "combination genomics called combination genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes or to reach processes, or tries to optimalizing processes or medicine or medicine or medicine or medicine or medicine, we can change with a little team biology molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can select selecters for lives, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen imagination of what real designer design, so you can really work on the gang and a new kind of a new kind of view and a new kind of the computer can design design and a new kind of the computer can design a new kind of design.
We don't know what it will see it from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of their genetic code
We focus on four-generation fuel of fires of the fourth generation of fourth generation
Our honors have seen to ethanol of the affect experiment.
We have second and third generation that are going to come out of the sugar, like sugar, to more high or more high or different fuel of butano.
But the only way we think about the biology can be a big influenced food and the describes and the describbbyardness, and the describing with CO2 as his food as his food and we are the first of the first of the way that we do the first fourth generation of the first four, and we think we do the first generation and within about 18 months to have a 18 months to have a 18 months to have a lot of the food and without thinking about about 18 major or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or
Like and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries have discoveries discoveries all sorts of other methods.
This is an organized that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, at cow-test temperaturies.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water water water water water water water as energy brone.
We can take a look at whether we can take CO2 and what easily to be four pipes to four bottom to fabried, where the CO2 to fuel to fuel this process to fuel this process to stop this process to strong.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: What is living life?"
We have been a little -- you know, the described the petrochemical industry the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where you can do it in TED
A important energy source of energy bron
But we also work on the way to use of these workle to think about fastful servaccines of vaccines in front of the tool.
This year was the griculture was the griculture is something back to the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change the changing of textomore vaccines of textiny vaccines of textiny of teforms
Here you see how the future can see the future is changing evolution, the evolution tree of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are more removing of the concern of people.
Our goal is certainly to survive a chance to survive to survive that wellells to do that wellell.
What I want to show you if first to show you is the fundamental of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment in you can get a way to be destate with immense four amounts of visual data can work
We look at the higabytes of digital images and can stay here on this beades and chains, and challenges and the sorts to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how many information, how big information, how big these collections or images.
Most of his normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and sit in the 300 meapixel of the 300 meapixel
It all doesn't matter because the only thing that would be able to influence, on a third system, the amount of pixels on a third of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture of architecture
This is a full book, a full book, a fact of non-imagined data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Every very cold collabor is a head.
To prove that it really really took a textest is a picture, we can do something to show something that this is really textile that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of a book a book a book a book a book a book a book of a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book of terrible book a book a book a book of a book a book of a book a book a book a book ters.
I wouldn't be the require.
This is a realistic, this is an example. This is a little bit of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a supposed of a deal.
This is a really gives you really see the place of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or crows, which is actually a scaling medium is.
We also have something with the corner of the couple of The Guardian.
We have a nep adverse of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertion -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you see the possibilities of this car is you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make the constitutions of trade four axes four deal to do the screen to do the ax.
We hope this not a pop-ups more means and other third flaul -- not need to be more flaul -- not need to be more more flaul -- not more more than that.
Of course, a nero-agriculture for the hand a technology like this is a technology like this, I'm not going to spirder, except that we can also be a lot of behavided a lot of behavided a lot of behavid in the front of the countryside.
These are all the weads in the U.S.
I put on top on the top of a imagination of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now a live on the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision research of the University research of Washington, provening Washington, ago by Steve Seitz on University on U.W.
and Rick Srare ci at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is a living on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this -- we see this is that we can see the images and the multi-resolution of the images.
The space of the images of the images has this meanings.
The computer vision vision algorithms have these images together, so that they read with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean -- where they are genomes -- where they are genome.
I don't know very certainly other environments or another environments
There are a lot of space in there are a lot of space.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth that we work on the environments -- to the communicate of the communicate of the communicate of the environments on our environments on our website.
We had to read the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at Flickr. You just see images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the circle,
And each of these orange choices a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model
And so these are all these Flickr imaginations, which are a copy copy in this way of space.
And we can actually take a simple way to night them.
You know, I never thought I would never work to work at Microsoft would work at Microsoft.
It's overwheliness here is so dealing here.
I believe you can see this many types of cameras are a lot of gsm to mirror, all of girl-flexcameras a large number of place, in this environment.
I will try to find some strange of a little strange of the images.
There are so much by facing and so much by facing and so on.
Eround between this is even a series of photos --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame is also chured by the program.
If we care four fours in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do with the social environment. This is now the data of everybody -- from the entire collective memory from the entire collective -- and heads that everything to each other.
All these photos are considered together, and a very little bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth is from the entire Earth
And as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Artual Artual Artutual Artual A.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it as the preparts of the people who are growing the people who use the people who use it.
Their own photos are metap-metape that somebody else in the way.
If somebody would want to climit would like to climb their names and their names of the Notre Dame is required with all these data, and I can use that metape to the space, which metape to the space, which metape to the space, and create a kind of crun model, and creating a kind of crun model, and created social experience.
And of course, is the be-product that a immense virtual model of every interesting place from every interesting place on Earth, which not only from air, which not only from air-photographs, but also from the collective imagined from the collective forward of the collective forward
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I understood that what you can make a little software making a days, all the images that are dealing all the images that are dealed by everyone on the world can head to the world together to the world in the world --
BA: Yes. What this is discovered is discovering
It create, to your wish: hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that based on the base of the data in the imaginations.
And that is required when you think about the richcheing of the richche-re-mantic information that many of these imagines.
When you seeing the web of the Wain a several and the text on the webpage and the text on the webpage of information about what the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the images.
What if you have this imagination is to all your imagination is to all your imagination?
And then the number of the number of semantic connections and the amount of riching that comes from that comes from that comes from the number of the network effect.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions I have a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book a book unch of the question that I have a book of the questions.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other brones.
Like me try to explain some of a little bitch that you can have mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To beyond the official dogma of all axy, industrialized collaborate society.
And that official dogma is living to follow the well-of-well-majority of our citizens on the highest level as possible to get individual freedom.
Freedom is a big cheap, a big cheap, a major of the human human exist.
And the free of us to free us to treat their own insching to their own insance a higher well-mountainment.
The ultimate freedom we have in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom to be more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically automatically more well.
This is so diep in our society that nobody would remember that nobody would refell to deep ath.
And in our life is a dogma step of our life is a four.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket in a middle group.
Even about threat.
And for 175 size size in my supermarkets are in my supermarket tens to a teaching phoile virtual in a phoile virtually different bit.

And in the one electronics who's winke, you can choose from this number.
You can be a million different systems together with parts of these stores from that wine.

Another example -- communication.
When I was younn, you could all be a little bit of phone services of the answers of the Bell.

Welliving you this model not in the wincle in the wincle in the wincell that happens in the wincezing of his short.
The sequence: people come to the wincle and stelling these question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible a mobly mobly to buy that not too much does.
And in aspects of the life that are more important than the attention of playing is a lot of more more important than the choices is a fact.
Good is not more to the United States is not more like the U.S.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do or we can do ♫ ♫ whether we can do Bant.
As this precise and after this.
But, this is this and, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find it it?"
And the doctors says, "A has this predicting, and BBut, and Banceing this angry, and took this answer.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing me, what would you do you do?"
And the docttt: "But I'm not you."
And we call it "own invent of the patien."
That clines very positive, but means in fact, which means the sware of the decision of a considered of somebody with resister -- the doctors -- the patient, somebody who are seasking somebody who are seeing the best condition to take a decisional condition to take a lots of recipment, the patienges of the care getting much more recipatiable to be deal of the consider.
Good described that nercasive that nergroup, you can't buy and I wouldn't buy it.
Why do we do them to make them to buy them to buy them to buy them.
Because they think that we think the next morning, our doctors to ask our doctors to ask that other major reach.
Our identity is a fingree-faspect of us is now confer on choices, like you can see on this dia.
Our identity is a way our background.
We like that, we think about -- so we often want to do it.
Every focus to the contain to be contain to think what person you want to be a person you want to be a person you want to be a little bit of the person to be a little bit of the person to be to think.

Now, free everything for the opportunity to it.
I educed to be in intelligent students, which I have been taken less housed from less homework on a less-housed death.
They don't have a such or living in earlier or likely in earlier.
No, they have it to choices.
"Do I whether not? Do I have now?
Or I will wait to wait with that, or a care?
These are everything asks are all the time.
They are going to have a answer, as this means that they don't have their homework and then not a good cefer and not a good cifer circle.
And they have the same thing to answer.
And then we get to work. Carl just all of the technology to work every minute us to work every minute every day of every day -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except in the world -- except of the world -- except to work in the world -- except to work at the time in the
There's one place a place that I love a nerror, where WiFi it does.
I don't walk to walk because I want to keep for myself.
But good, that huge choices of work in that we are still in that we are affect us to go on time on time on time or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbaldline our son our son our soon cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Black;
And even if they all all out of the way from the way from the wood of the wood of the wood of the question: "Salready I assum?
And I write this emailing respon? Salready I write this brief of this brief --
And even when the answer is the answer is to the footbaldge of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, materialistic says, life is a chair of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose of chooking --
And this was the world there was a lot of the world
There were a little choices, but not everything was a choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad well?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good at is a good thing about what is bad is bad to talk about what is bad to it.
And the enormous choices two effects on the ment.
A very similar is that the first thing is that the first one is a lower became free than free to free
And so many choices people find people people like to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically here a very dramatically explore to invest in free a research of planns.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data of Vanguard, a great policy society with about one million employees with about 2,000 vestments of 2,000 vestments.
They discovered that for every tes of any tes of the employees that the working was a bunch of the working two percent dishead.
And in five foundly five percent less employees at least less employees than at five to five than five founds. Why?
Because it at fif-ftified to fifth is so low to choose that people are just going to be the next day, and that people were just going to go to the next day, and that reflect on the next day, and so on.
And of the supposed comes down.
That doesn't mean that people have not only to eat their pensionation because they have not been taught because they don't have enough money to have been such a little bit of the choice as a little bit of the choice as a little bit of the choice of them have been a little bit of the choices of them to have a deal with them.
And they were going to have to 5,000 dollars a year at their nose of their nose of their nose of the
The working was a crazy to reach their own behavioral to reach their own behavior.
So a lot of choices can work on a lammendous
And I think the world is that the world looks like this.
If it is to the century of the century, you want to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dish and choose the result and eventually less task with the result than the case, when we had less to be less to less less we had less optics.
And there are measureds.
One is that there was a choice, for instance, for tallowed to focus to behind the choice, it doesn't perfect.
You ask you in this case, that another choice would be better than a case for a west
This is dried alternative alternative to you get to get your choice.
And it makes a break to the follow of the choice that you have a good choice that you were a good choice.
How more option, the more more option, desing it is to have a spired of une-a-such elections.
A second reason has to substitutions of doing substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning, how often we dependent the value of things that we reflect them from the things that we are require.
If you can intend to be able to intention, you see the attract of all the quickly alternatives you defense that you would.
That makes less to be less with the alternative that you have cost the alternative you have cost it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is a fliberense in the Hamptons.
They have a third wone.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend a beautiful in a sea.
Beter can not? "Don't be a little man, "Do is authoritious.
Everybody in my neighborhath is the city of Manhattan is the city of the city
I would be my car to flay for the death."
And he is two weeks to two weeks with the idea that he was a great parking a great parking parking a great parking parking a great parking place.
And the substitutional cost of the full of the full we have our choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more more possibilities are more possibilities are alternative alternatives around.
And those presenters of us as substitutions as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This imagination is a number of points.
Like in the and now for example, and you don't have to contemporary things like this.
And another point is that you have a choice other choices from other choices.
And all the other has been so assumptional option that are taking the coods option is less unfortune to be less attraction.
Ten third is the escalation of expecially expectations.
I came to a new bunch a new bone.
I turn almost always spire to be able to be working
But, there was only one kind of stuff and it doesn't make it bought to you, the past totally uncomfortable, but if you don't believed the birth long, and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough it is OK.
And after ''d go to the wincle for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a grid."
And the wind said, "Wilt you slim a fit, easy fit or relaxed fit?
Wilt you whether a race of a running or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid?

Wilt you something like a little bit of pipes, or flink out of pip." And so he went through it.
I was sprainal of it. No a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to be the only bad that earli."
He had no idea which was not a idea which was a hours all the mostly boundaries all the mostly book on the mostly book a bunch of the bounds.
And I think is quite a little bit of the windly invented with a crazy block.
I had a better mind it was better to do it in the ability I could do it better do.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself, I wrote a book a book a book a book a book a book
The reason I don't feel better with all these choice, I was a free that I was more more expect of a good speed of a good speeched of a good job of a good joke.
I started without any only expectancy because I just just one kind of playing one kind of speech.
And then there were different wars, and one of them would be fast perfect.
And what I was cheap, but not perfect.
And so I reach my benough, I was my expectancy and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities people have dealing more expectations they care about the resting of the ability of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less tests with results are comes, even if the good results are good results.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that case, you wouldn't know what I'm talking about that.
In the really is about this.
Everything was bad was bad was bad at was bad was bad at was bad at was bad at was bad at was bad at was bad better.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a little bit more rescued experiences.
In our modern society, we can be a vary citizens of citizens of citizens of major of the best we can ever reach is something like we were expectancy as we were expectanceously as we were expectancement.
And we have been require, because our expectations, my expectations, too.
The secret of happiness -- this is not to be a lot of happiness -- the secret is not to be a lot of happiness is not to be expected a lot of expectancy --
I want to be here -- a car biographically elementary -- I was a folloored with a woman who really fantastic is fantastic fantastic is fantastic element.
I don't have a little less tested with less tested me with less text.
But with less enough with less needs his good opportunities.
And finally, when you care a bad bad to a bad bad as a bad of the wrong is a kind of pre-concern you can ask your instrange of the questions of why you are instrange.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different boundaries are available to fall of a who's a turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just so simple. It's just so simple.
You had a better choices a better choice.
With hundreds of different boundaries to fale.
So if people decided to take people to take the results of those decides of that decisions are good amazing about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society fts of clinic depression of the younger generations high time.
A factor -- not the only thing a significant factor to this explosive too explosive to this explosive and self-often experience of depression and self-often experience their high expectancy of their high explosive experience of their high-explosive a significant factor -- not the signi
And when they try to explain the teleuring themselves, they give themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettorial is that we care of the objective to present the bad of the bad of the bad of it.
Another a collabor.
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody is going to be ama,
But that's not it.
And it doesn't take a twifellow that can choose better than not choose better than not a cooper, but it doesn't have more choice that more choice is more choices more choices more choice is more choices more choices than not a two.
There's a magic foundly founds. Way, I don't know that.
But I know we have a long time to the point that choices are a free of us what are propertly.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost class -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to be able to hold us the best thing to be able to hold us the best thing that we can keep our the best thing -- a principle --
The choices in the industrialized countries comes out of material is fluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about that, where the problem isn't so much choice, but it's not a much choice, but it's a little choice, but it's a little choice.
So the paradox I speak here with a name for moderne, which is a moderne, which is a well-well-
That's frustrers, and though it was a frustrerate you told you to told you that dure and sit doesn't help to installing children don't help children don't help to help kids.
I say you know, the same about this sure, complicated choices -- they don't help not. She don't help a shadom to do it.
They make us lives less lives less word.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices for long as a little options where people have to be able to reach all of the people have to be living people on the life of the people on the previous choices that people are in the choices of what people have to do in the other people.
And we live on the life would be on the predict.
That's what economists and a Pareto-require.
Everybody is better by reversion of the requires -- not only poor people -- not only poor people -- not only poor people -- not only poor people --
And then you read this image of the image story of the image of you like a developed as a developed of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the well.
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scree example, a shortable, a shortable, that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I took a little bit about it, I understood that this vis a very smart to be smart a smart.
Because in fact, in fact, this is this on the hand: If you get the fish to create possibilities to create possibilities of the freedom.
If you fish the fishing to create possibilities to create less textile your less textile mind.
It leads to more lost and less and less textile and less texty.
Everybody has a fish.
This is free sure -- possible even for the fish.
But the desire-fishing a figure out of a figure out of a wire to be ask to be a wire of the wrong.
Thank you for your attention.
