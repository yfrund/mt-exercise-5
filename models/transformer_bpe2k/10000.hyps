And I showed these two slide of the pools to show that the pools the pools of the last three million years about the last three million years of the vastate of the VS, with 40 percent croms.
But this is actually the entered of this specific problem because it doesn't get the slide of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice thing that we do the did.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a sense of our global climating heart system.
It's going to get in the winter and crimpt in the six.
The next slide that I shows is a version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanentire ice in the rood.
As you see, it out of the dark blaw.
That's the year of the major of the winter.
And the crimpt in the six.
The so-ad, and the permanent, five years older, is almost like blood, that from the body's squared and it up of the body and it takes here.
In 25 years, the one of this to this one.
And that's a problem because the fors of the North Ictuated the North Ictum and there is a very large amount of fellowing woman, as the death, when it was a very large amicroyed by microyed by microys.
As with the total amount of the total amount of the atmosphere, that could be requiped to the amount of the entire point that can be survive the entire point to surface the engineering the environment.
In some unlikely undeeps in Alaska rely methane of the water.
And last winter was going to be Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another deep to another ondiep in another ondiep here.
Why! She's OK. The question is echter or we will be going to be that will be going to be there.
A reason for there, is that this huge "warming fun bron" Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north,
This is a smell muscle
The watervolume is echter more than the amazing than the eyes of the waters.
This is the Kangerlussian river,
If you want to know how the sea lot of style because it turs out because it is the place where it is the place where it is the sea is the sea to the sea
These stroming nears to the fluence.
And the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, bed the largest ice ice mass mass mass mass mass on Earth.
And the last months of rapport scientists that the entire continent now a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice in the west, in the west, very quickly quickly quickly of the water-a-water-a-a-a-pully.
The whole continent to six meter seespeak of seespeak as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass mass mass gners, which a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of the dreinquatic water.
In the Andes, this glester the bron of drinking water.
There are now more stroes.
But when they disappears, it also disappearing water.
In California was a remindering 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the waterreservoires of the waterreservoices.
And as you clear, the progress, the progress.
This global dreamed dress to a dramatical style to a dramatical styes.
And the number of nature, the entire world is speaking with a unbelief-and never seen solid faster and never seen a fastly fastly and never seen a fail.
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unhold.
If you look at the same time of a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 acive years of the 24 hours every 24 hours --
25 miles every day in our oceans, and you look at the same time to the eyes of the StilOcean, from America, westing from America, and every side, and every side, and every side, there is a behaviors of the ocean is a stic daling of the oceans.
The only one of the Earth, the the Earth, the Earth, which is the defront of 20 percent money is the requires of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and steenking is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding the China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more cities.
But we see a circle of the engineer.
These are the cools of the ban value of the ban became an inside the last years, and where large-natives.
There is echer a political streeding in our country.
The cities of carbon and oil industrial gave 250 million dollars to promotion, 250 million dollars to promotion, which is a consister cool of the environment.
And that picture of the things that did to something thinking about that.
And the guy was in Tennessee, in Tennessee, about four billion literally cross the simild of the power of the cool.
You probably see it probably in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the valuable.
This is the one after one after the largest fally.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertises of the cities.
Video: """"rosty the city-carbbone, a crossed guess.
He's fluence is fluence here in America, and he makes our economy grow.
Frosty the coolman is is going to be scone.
He paid and scate, and shapes and works, and work."
Here is a big part of the city-col in West Virginia of Virginia of day.
The largest minitial workers is the large of Massey Coal.
Video: Don't Blankenship -- "Let me dunidly Al Gore, Nancy Pelsi, Harry Rearry Rey, Harry Reassi, they don't know where they talk about talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimating two campaign protect of two campaign on your tily on your your body.
This is a piece of a erage.
For ideo "Bue COLwory, we see the climatment as a serious dreunder to our things.
That's why the reason why the reason is to give us a gigantic behavior to give a gigantic behaviors and the destraight of the truth of cities.
Feit is, steend, not smart.
We find that it is -- and it was left -- and it still lives and the run
So, you don't make a climath change.
Let that but on us to us.
Video: Acteur: Schone cities, you have a lot about it.
So we let's take a look at this hypermodern scone.
Fantastic. The machines make very well to make a little bit of lai.
But that's the sound of scale cities.
Our phanks the fact that the front of the cities of the main order of the Earth is the major of the Earth is the remarkable cools that you see all the time.
Look at the same thing around the scale carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative and that on the area of national veility.
Video: Stem: Stem: America in crisis, the economy, the neational security security the climate, the climate.
The rode rock in all these things, our dependence of fossil fuel sunited and heited the vile collalapshed and heited oile collalapshed in the oil and hearing the rode of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of
But now there's a during new solution to get new solution to share out of this.
Forth America of 100 percent scene scale electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get the time to get to get a plan that a plan that us is a plan to get the rewarming of the Earth is made the Earth of the Earth
And in the enough a solution that enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our took how to do
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: Stem: Stem: My America to give America.
And one of the speed ways to make a end of the end, to our dependence of old old square to help our planets to help our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Noodd of the jobs to create good paid jobs to create good past.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic
Al Gore: There is an old African old African old African argument that says, "If you want to be going to be going to be going to be all of the time.
If you want to go to to together."
We have to go and fastly far and quickly.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I required to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am it. And so I don't waren't waren't waren't the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever entrees.
It has to the engineered to nabove the engineering less than a billidest second after a billion.
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine under Genevil.
We photos of those lets of that left in detectors in detectors and this is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters -- 44 meter in the detector -- 44 meters in the detector -- 22 meters in the deameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attracular picture that you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that worried for a fact in the controlls of the controll.
It's a photograph of the first particle that all around the way around the LHC good, and with a piece of the LHC, with a piece of the LHC, by the detector in the detector in the detector of the detector of the detector of the LHC, and the photograph of the LHC,
And with other words, when we saw that photograph at 10 September we knew that is a huge government.
I don't know if this is the largest the largest of this -- when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet pages that the Internet page pages of saw it as a looked like this.
And that means we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of the too.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golds behaviors.
And they were the behavide 13 thousand of a thousand of the power works.
The engineers under you will say, "Well, you know, it's like like the little behavior."
They can do that because they are superidend to all the lage temperaturs.
So on the min 271 grads, colder than the garms between the stars, that can behaviors that behaving behaving the behaviors that behaving the behaviors that behaviors that are behaving the behaviors that behaviors are agrees that behaviors are a boom of the starppears that behavior
In one of the connect between the neine of the neine magnets in LHC, a construction.
And then the weird was a hearmer, and there was electrical wearing against that 13 thousand of amps.
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 ton weas, and they were about 30 centimeter words about 30 centimeter words on the time.
We have about 50 monkets about 50 monkes.
We had to get them out of stories, what we did we do.
We all did them all the too.
Now they're back to wead.
Eind muntil the LHC againtace.
We will take it back and we expect it and we further and we can go to the right or right with the stuff that we can go to the challenges of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, that have been incidents the debate of scientific research. It's easy easy to research.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so hard to be more difficult than the true of things like the LHC.
I showing the English scientists to the English scientist Humphananimal experiments the deserts of the values of the values of the value of his teacheration of the true Faray, Michael Faray, this is so dangerous for the progress of human minds that our imagest our images of the human mine that we are not the mysterions in the engineering that we are not a great confollowed to the new envirvironment,
Thank you very much.
I would like to ask you to ask back to your children to your children at your children's time you played with blocks of the blocks of the blocks
When you discovered how to graduate how you had to graduate and then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a little bit of space relations.
Ruface is strong is strong is because with the world to understand us
If an information that if a information by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with the advise Pattion and my advise Pattion and my front of Kalanii -- what we would use a computer -- what if we use a computer that would be using an instead of the environment that a kind of digital regular individuce that we can be a city to the reauthore the reauthi -- we can be information with the information with the information with the information with the information with the instead information of information that is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and then I beg
and and ordering the morning we want to do
This question of asking us so that we decided to look for a answer to look for the build of Siftles.
Siftable to give a Siftable of a cookable computer large computer in a cooky.
They can be able to get the past they can feel together their movement detect and they fell and they are a screen and she's going to be act.
The nuclear starts is the physical treately blocks like blocks like blocks by graph to graduate the graves.
And the way of the Siftables a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that these help-help-high different, and the other physical different, and and even of the way we movement, and even of the way we move and some new kinds of the way we move interacies to discover and interacts of the way we movement.
I'm going to start with some simple simple examples.
This Siftable is instant to tell a video to tell you a video to tell opportunity and other sones and other square playing and others changed to play a cell played to play a shed of the chance to tell you a video to tell you a care played to tell you a video chance to tell you a video can
These interactive portraits of conscious.
And then then they will put together, they will interinterest to each other.
If they are working on the engineering this and can be single this and become sides.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of these interactive, the use of these interaction, the use of the scene, like it was a fluence as it was a fluid like a fluid list as the fluistop.
In this example three Siftables and care for and I can use them to go to a little bit of a likely good, where they are they going to be ment.
And if we have follows, we were back back to the back back back to that.
There are some of the crive education for the education of education, mathematics with language and logics that we want to give people the possibility to probers, and the result to prober, and the result is un-centered immediately soil.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacces by a simple remarkable to know about a simple response to a simple remarking.
And here we show a spel that a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you have in every single of the round of every Siftable, and and give you control, and I have controled in a wordboom.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and a difference of a new series of a little bit of the abilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the excurient to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try and make them to try and make a video of video and make a video of video and make a video of it.
They were actually actually actually away from that.
And one of the most interesting things of these approach is that people are not going to have to have instructions of instructions of the construction.
Everything you have to say "Most word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
And here are some other people to tests.
That's our botest bone-tester, right?
And it seems that he was the Siftables wrotables would.
For him this only blocks.
Here is a interactive painted painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new carents in the scene, by just the Siftable with that carakter of the carakter of the tafe of the taf.
Here he shows the son the sion.
Video: The son comes up there.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
God done daan! Yeah!
And then the scue of Siftables and the narrow and the narakters to respond to each others with each others -- Video: Wift!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end of a pully.
and he decided to how it astropt.
Video: The cat airs wead.
DM: The last example that I'm going to show show Is a synthesizer and music is a synthesizer and music is a sound product that we developed a sound product like the lead, bass and pressed the levels and pressure presses.
Eengineer, every different variations, where you can cut your choose what you want to use your want.
These sounds can be injected in a lege Siftables are injected the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern in the sounds of the sounds of the sound itself in the pattern Siftables of the sounds of the sounds of the pattern
You put a sound in the pattern by the attackable of a listents of a lower of controll-control-control effects like reverb and movie and movable effects of the engineering effects of a lower Siftunched by the reverb Siftable effects of a living of a li
They are going to be sound and deaths and attracked by cantelevily to cantely cancy.
And the other other effects like tempo and volume that are progress and volume that are appeared on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftles, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, by a extra lead.
Now I place the basline of the line of the line of the basline
Video: DM: Now I feel what I feel worry.
Video: DM: And now I copy the filter of the filter of the print, so I can be able to be influence.
Video: DM: I can spend it by the changing of the cantely blocky.
Video: DM: Now now I cut the philter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can recognized the pattern as it plays.
And I don't need to ply everything to planns, but I can make it very longer and shorter and shorter and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the end end the animals of the entire of the volume Siftable to opportunity to opportunity to opportunity
Thank you.
And as you can see the passion of the passion of new people's interfaces that are better interfaces that our brains are involved in the way our brain and working together.
And today I had the time to show you one new election in this designer area of couple of the developing we develop developing the developing we develop in the lab.
The dad thing I want to bring is that this only the attzed to a very new generation to a very new generation for the interacting with digital media that the information to our world as we want to our world as we want to bring it the information to our world as we want to do it.
I dance you from heart.
I look at the way to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Buks write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life is a long life for write and I don't think that ever will ever change that ever ever change.
And in the one one of the invitial happened in my life and career and career and career with my work on my work on my work on my work on my work on my work on my work on my own own own own own heard.
It started a book that I had a book that I have written a memoire: "Eath, Bempty that in fact to my first work on my hone, and an international and an international exister and an international existence.
And the population is that people have to have all all and always following me as whether I do bone.
And what -- I mean,
People come to me and questions to ask me and questions you can't get this success to be this success to equipy this succes?
You don't know that bang you will be able to keep your entire life to write a book in the autiful parts that people will be able to get to cut up to get to care for warm.
You don't know there are the bigger?"
Erg tiny of you know.
Of course, that would be very be. But I remember that I was a little bit about 20 years ago, I was a tiend, I told I was told I was told I wanted to be a tiend,
People said, "Do you don't get success that you never get succes?
Do you don't afford to the engineering, that you will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a job.
You don't know that you are your life to this work on this work without that there is ever ever come out that one of your buildings on the puin of your buildings on the puin of your buildings with your bitters,
Every thing in that stream.
In the short comes to ask this on this notice is "Yeah,
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are enough that are enough to be enough to be affect all those things.
Altime of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things bang, you want to know what you want to know for all the time.
For example, and other engineer, and other engineers.
But what I mean, what I ask myself the last time to the last time when the angst today.
Is the ration?
Is it the logical that somebody is air to be big, for the work for the work for their mend?
And what is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the minessell of the strong work on the other species of work at the same time working at the other thing that is not happen to happen at the other time working.
Take my father. He was scaled engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years, I was ever a talked to him that he was a talked about it was a big.
That's how to you say, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, so it was not about it.
And to be fair beyond engineers have engineers have a hones have a crazy crazy to study for stustudy to study for study cohosts for study cohosts of the tools of the tools of the century coholists of the century coholi
Scheat well, who have a reputation.
And not just write the other creative people have been able to be able to be able to be able to be instabious instable.
Look at the grim of the most magnife of the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many stiered young, often by own act.
And even those who don't move to be moving to be a smomom to be swell.
In the last interview for his dead said, "Meman Mailer: "Me: "Meat is a piece of mind."
That's notice what to say to save your life.
But of this kind of exciting this we don't look at it.
We all heard it all of the first and have it accepted and accept.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity unlock is unlocated to the list and that a artistified and that a artist-entire state to read to read to read to read the end.
So I want to ask everybody here today, you know, I want to ask that idea of life?
Do you think of that OK?
Because I think I think about a good thing about it, I think I don't think about it all the way to mind.
I think it is the weather.
And also even even dangerous.
I wouldn't like to see that this century is so good.
We can creative mind to life.
I know that it would be able to live in my situation, for my situation, for the dark to those dark day.
Sequire the fashion that my career.
Go after that, I am still young, amper veil.
I can still have four decades to work on the decades
And the Hoogsty is going to be now with the outside the outside the outside world as the work that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under the each other, so I can selling you you very much.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think of the things that you know the morning to the morning to the morning to the following and the following the vices.
So I don't want to get that.
I love me to be a consider with the work where I love the work I love to work of the work I love me of the work I love me of the work I love me of work.
The question is: "Human?"
And after after after after after I think I can just come to the conclusion that I can just go through a psychological protect as I have a psychological protect in the process iness.
I have to create the write of the securient deast-and destate and my survive and my survive and my response of the reactions in my future.
I have the last year we had seen it to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of the history and have done and deept me in other civilizations to see or others a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search to the old Greets of the old Greeks and Romens.
Let up because it's a long and a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romenenened and Romenen't creativity of hending to the creativity of hensible --
Men believed that creativity was a godddline that was a responsible place, to the ments of the ments and unknown to the mental reasons.
The Greeks called this decisions of creativity of creativity "demonit."
And the one of Socrates believed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he words influistence.
The Romenon the Romeness had a species of the tacks.
And you know, they have to have a consider creative creative to a geni."
The grappy is that the Romenen't an genion, a for a genion.
In their police was a genius was a genian god-entities that remember the murs of the poorest of the artic of the artic of the artic of the artic goddly.
A little bit like Dobs of the house
If the artists was the working on the genia.
On the face he was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the desistance I had, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artisted was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you don't get work to the work to you wouldn't have all the ear.
Everybody knew that was an unvisible geniious geniion.
And you spend your work work on your work -- you know, not just to you.
Everybody knew that you have a nogal independed genion.
Lange time is that we had been proted.
And then the Renaish.
There is a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and folks and mysteries.
Go space for mystical weather, intend to the godline world.
That was the beginning of the rational house
People believed that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual follow.
And for the first time in history, there was talking about artists to a genion, and they were a genion, and they had a genion.
I have to say that I think I have to find that a big follow.
And to give one person, one one of individual individuduce that he or the the securrent is the sourcer of the century of the century of the century of everything godddling the one of everything -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something that is a lot of human psychchurche.
Also, or you ask the sun in the skey skey sket.
Egos are buildings to gigantic proportions and there are unprestatic proportions of expectations of exactly cess.
And I think this press the last 500 years, the last 500 years,
If that is, and I think that I think is the question, "What do is the question.
Can we do this different different things?
Can we go back to a old began to a old began to the relationship between the human and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
We can make a 500 years, we can rational home, not unfortune in a 18 minutes to speed.
And the earliful people who are in the audience scientific scientific two-tifels about the idea that fight-high-weighs with what fact the work of pursuing artic test to inspiring high-tes and bring high-temporary tles.
It doesn't seem to get you all of there,
And I ask it to ask me to that.
Why not?
Why would we have that thought that I don't want to get that I don't want to get that day?
It is just so much as much holds as all the other explanations of the totally crowed untearage that are conservation in creative process.
Everybody who have to create something to create -- so in fact all the attacks, and here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process of rational.
And that some of the almost paranorally, it feel of the parent.
I have unlanguage the great American animal American Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone of the time.
And they are the ninty. Her whole life all life all life of the life they did.
She told me about her youried on the pat the platand of Virginia.
Some on the following on the work was felt on the side, they heard a close to the country.
It was so she was so one, if there was a big golf air.
And so it was close gold, then the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across the country to her it.
She feel that the ground of her feet took and whether her at that time, but one thing to do to do for her at that time, and one thing to do to her life.
And they running to home up by the paper and they had to see it as quickly as possible and paper and seen paper and see paper and seen paper and seen paper and shape.
When it was the close by her hold her hold her her only to write the only chance to write it on the write of the write of the write of the write to write the one of the write of her ha hold similar to write the only similar to write the shaped by the shaped by the writing.
Sometimes they didn't quickly enough.
Then ring and ring side, but calculate it
And in the purposed to her him through her heavy and the following in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in
And there were going to get -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the beautiful of the story -- they were the close to me.
Then she was looking for the paper and paper and paper, and shaped it through her him through her head.
You're going to get a potent than a potent of the potased to paking.
And with her other hand, so told me she's seen it out of the air.
She paked the purched and then it back back into her body, and then it back into her body, and they she's the operating it up the crow of the shaped it up in her body, and they she's the crow it back into its body, and then it again.
And in that cases came up with the paper that in the paper in the papier, but then in the engineered followed followed followed following in the end.
And then I was thought I was thinking -- what I was going to be a creative process of creative process to create process of creative process to be a creative process of the cook!
That's how to works, my creative process of not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse of a mouse of every day on the same time on the same time and deaths and transsswed and and transsshed and transswed and transs-up on the same time.
But even in that days I've had a thise of this experience of experience.
You will also know it to know the call, that sense that there are creative ideas in your opborrelies from a bron that you can identify untifate to identify untifate the impossible of a bron that you can identify untifate ideas in your ophigh.
What is that then we do it for fu?
How do we use it without that we are word?
At a way that we do for us to is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musiciance Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I was interviewed him for a while,
We had it to do that.
Tom is a big part of his life life life the showed the toonce of the crazy artists that are trying to get out of all the power that from all the power to get the unconnected creative impulsable creative impulating the impulating the resevered to get up the inside of the requipment of the copy artic impultic cre
And the 19190s.
And one day he read in Los Angeles of the faster and changed the process of the radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical --
And while he heard there was a fragmentation of a melodie.
The decided is that the inspiration that is doing, ungraph -- well, crow wellend.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fash.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper at the paper at a taperecorder to see a tangle of the paper at the time.
The whatever the spanning back back to the heavy of him: "I got the melotic that case it century behind me century.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it too."
He didn't get the purpose in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and decide something news.
He looked at the air, and he looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry you can't see that I sat it is the stud?"
"Do you really write that I can write a love this?
If you want to get this love to come to later later at the time, you have to go and you have to do that, I have time for you.
And now, not, somebody else falls.
Go buurts at Leonard Cohen." And then then then I love the process of love the process of different.
And the work is the same thing with the dark of the dark entire subject.
But the sixed that creative process in him regular process in him him when he distance distance of the geniion.
The geniy sisted him and read it and livered just the enterness and read it to the engaged to the shaped to the shaped and the genion.
And to realized that there was not to reduce to go to the entered by going.
It could also be a wonderful party, a wonderful conversation between Tom and the propertent aspect that not all of Tom itself was not all of Tom itself was not all of Tom itself
And that story has changed my way of work.
I have had been profited to be profited of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddaring the middle of Ead, Biddy.
And in a moment, I have a point.
You know that that wouldn't do you want to be good and you think it a terrible ramp of ramp of the book book.
It's not a bad bad and bad of the bad bad of it.
I wanted to do the whole project to do all of the way to do the whole project.
And then I remember Tom who who was going to be geniion, and I decided to way.
I was going to walk from my manuscrips and found, and I founded me to a very much.
And I said hardop: "Lister done that if this book is not just the way to be silliant -- it's not just by me.
You can see that I have all in what I have in my time.
I can't give you to give you.
If you find that it has to be better to do your thing to do you do your thing to do you do to your thing your thing to do.
Snap you don't know that? Do you don't thank you.
I just write because that's one of the work.
Oh, and in the notuls are a little bit of that are just a differently.
Ta--- Uited the right here --
Euwen ago, in the North African wrong African wrong people to desperate to a maanlide of the music.
And the Uren and hurthers, to the morning to the morning to the morning glors.
And that was always wonderful, because the danced were completely professionals.
But some of some of echeter something for education.
One of those dances became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen with a performer.
It was like the time to save the time and the dance and the danger.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had talked about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can meaning new sets of new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology of the digital code of that digital code to a new physics to a new phone to a new physics and synthetism of life.
So we tried to ask the big questions to ask the big question.
"What's living to think is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of a levels of a veaus.
We tried to bring different approaches to less components.
We're now now now the nearly 20 years.
When we did the human genome we have sequenced the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask and questions we can create and regenerate to create new life from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of digit?
This is the map of a little organized organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the tiny genome, with the kind of that can promise in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of that can be a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of that can be a laboratory in
And we tried to look at if we have to a night to a nine genome genome genome genome of genome genome of genome
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or somehow the 500 or somehow are.
But if we look at the metabolical carpull is relative to the insideed with the unsides.
Gelieve me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at a piece of shapes that would be a living cell the cell would read this a living cell would read this was a living cell that would be a piece of the genes that would be a piece that would be a little bit of the genes that would be a living cell the cell of the genes.
We decided to provide this is the only rout, to provide this chromosphere to synthetism so we could deal with the components to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to ask this chromosphere.
And so we started asking questions like this: "Can we have a chromosphere?"
Staat the chemistry it to make these very large molecular that we never have seen before?
And if we do that, if we do that, a chromosphere?
A chromosopm is a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalized to life is exponential education on exponential education.
Our moving the genetical code to write the genetics lose of slow-side, but is apply across the gentes.
And our last point would put it on this moment on this moments on a exponential curve.
We're starting to start with a lot of years ago.
There were some city for a couple of stadia bio-ethical ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese.
There are tiends of thousands in the world that little pieces of DNA making 30 to 50 literally in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the old you make it pieces of the old thing that are following the more following the more following of the powers are going to be a degener
So we had to create a new method of these little pieces and the corrigerate of all the following all the folds of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little four rus that bacteria diad.
We designed the studying the studying the foutcorrectimate
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 liters.
The spend part of the studying as we started a piece of chemical chemical straight in the bacteria and the bacteria and virtual cogs and virtual shares and virtual particles and virtual particles of gards and virtual shares the genetic cogs and the bacteria and the bacteria and the bac
The virale particles were done was the cells, they came back and then they came back and deaths and following the E.
I was unlanguage in speaking with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model to good quickly well.
They laught more than you love.
And so we think this is a situation where the software are are own hearth own heard, in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much largers.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromospher.
That's more than 580,000 litters genetic.
And so we decided to build them in cassettor of viruses in the size of viruses that we could experience the cassettal
and to understand what the deaths are the cells of a living cell.
The designer is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that must be very accutting very accure.
When we spent this genome for the first time in 1995 was the standard-past a 10,000 aged a 10,000 agreed a 10,000 agreed in the 10,000 ages.
And eventually we could be able to resequencing 30 old the original sequences the waren't used to start to starting to start to starting to start.
And our third of the designs that are 50 litts that 50 literally are going to be able to build the other pieces of 50 letters to build the studying little sub-on-one sub-on-one sub-on-one one one of these solid to build them together.
We design design here to be able to share the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of these parts of parts in the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of
Maybe you know, we have a lot of watermarks in strong.
Bedit: we have a four liter--wrong genetic, and T.
Trios of those letters code for the ruwrote 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attace for every aminoxyoxy-oxyo-oxyoxyozored pursus for every aminozur.
So we can use the genetical code to write words to write words in the mind.
And so we have some signs we just just to do that.
Some of the teleurged that there were not disappeared that there were not did.
We have these pieces of these studying that we can eat with enzyes.
There are enzyms that they reparate and each other.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces of these five to 7,000 letters for 7,000 letters country, and you have a pieces of 24,000 letter, and you have a piece of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every city crows, we have a government of these stuck so we could cut them to create a process that we want to create a process that will be very robly -- that you will see a little bit of strake.
We try to achieve it from automatision.
So this is what this looks like a basketbale.
And so we come to the real piece of the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow so easy more in E.
And that dester the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And we went to reach to other mechanisms.
We know a game that "homolo-recombination is used by the biology to repartly DNA to reparers, that pieces of DNA to reparts of DNA can feet.
Here's an example of it.
There is a organized Deinococcus radiodurans radiodurans that three million radied on can.
And that you see in the top of the pile, and I was a chromosphere just just from each other.
124 hours later sea ttook it again, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organized organizs that arounds of organizs that are thousands of organizs that arns.
These organized are completely to be done
They can live in a vacuum,
I know absolutely sure that there in space, can produce that can produce a new aquatically environment.
Well, after the way, the the way, there is a lot of of it,
And here is a little microfographer of molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with the right design, with the right design, which we did in the right design.
And that they have a card-a-card-atically.
This is not a electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of light.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience that we spent unlanguage.
This is more than 580,000 litters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a duce structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would describe it with a 10-points literally without spations of 142 pages of pages for the genetic code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code the genetic code points of the genetic code the genetic code of
Good, how do we starts a chromosphere? How do we do we do it?
And a frus is the clearly seen a clearly seen to easy.
And a bacteria is the much complicated.
It's also simply if you give you eukaryots, as eukaryots, you know the cell and does, and you do a different in and that's what you know if it is what you know about as the clones.
And in the bacteria is the chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell, but we have a full transplable transpline that we can explore transpline of a cell transpline of a cell to a other, and it can be activves.
We have a chromospheroy-soom of a micromosphere.
These are about so far as far as and mics.
We feed what extra genes that we could take this chromosphere's chromosphere.
We have the destraight with enzymes to make all the produce piece of the white study stuff
It was woman, we put this in the cell -- and you will stop the cell images of the cell images here -- the new chromosphere -- the new chromosphere in the cell.
We even thought that he would come to come to the set of it would come to develop the process of the process of developing it to develop the process of the process of the process of the process to develop the process to develop the process of the process to develop the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of it.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromospheres have a third of third in a third times, where they were thousands of the species.
People who evolved as if there are a single of equipment not a lot of biology for biology biology --
There are enzymes that are restriction of enzymes are enough DNA verters.
It didn't have a chromospher.
The cell -- the chromospheres that we stop -- what I was going to stop it.
It was express the other chromospherending the other chromospher, and we had the equipment and we had the cell we had the cell with the new chromosphere.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop the genes that we stop.
And in very short time and all the carakists of the engineering and changed the completely species in the new species of species that we had stop in the new software that we stop.
All of changed changed the membranes -- when we changed the genettic code code was the exactly where it was changed.
This is a genomics like genomician alchemist, but we are in the stead, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental
Good, I paid paid that this is not paid that this is a scale -- this is prepared in 3.5 billion years, and I paid evolution, and I paid a new version of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion, where there are major new species of scale.
Why would you do this.
I think it's pretty much as you look at what you need to what there is going to need to what there is going to need to what there is going to do it.
We're going to go into the next 40 years, and then half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet...
And every one of us that in 1946; within 1940 years, in 40 years,
We have a lot of food, with the food, with the square water, medicine, medicine, and a half billion.
That's really really really to do that for for that.
We use five billion tons of collapss, more than 30 billion following follows.
That's 100 milos of fath hone.
When we take biological processes in ogences or whatever process than you also take that a huge challenge of a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the stine that are in the atmosphere is really coming.
And for all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designer of the designer to the future.
The electronics industry had a dog of components, and look at the diversity that is from there is progress.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our extremely and our example.
We don't have techniques to do technology synthesemethods to do so called combination genomics to do the combination genomics
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the response of 20 million different genes or trying to optimalization to optimalization to create octon the cines of the tiny of the team of the tam of molecular biology than we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years, we can do with a little team of science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for lives, for lives, chemical or fun production and shapes production production.
This is a screen image of what real designer is where we are where we working so that you can really get to the new kind of the computer can design and a new kind of the computer can design design in the computer can design design design and a new kind of the computer of the computer of what real designs.
We don't know personal how it will see the one of it.
We know exactly how their genetical code of disease.
We focus on four on fourth generation of the fuel of fuel
Our longs you have seen to ethanol anol of a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the engineering and third more more high-digit fuels like occasures like octanoily or different kinds of butanoil.
But the only way we think that biology is a lot of the great influence without the food price and the described and the describes of CO2 as we start with CO2 as a food, and why we are we understanding cells that we do the first food that we think we are the first fourth of the first fourth of the engineering and within the first 18 months and inside about 18 months and then we think of the food.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwided discoveries of the other method.
This is a organized that we have protect in 1996.
It lives in the deepice, about 2.5 miles deep, at cow-five miles of temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular waterstor as energy waterstor as energy sources of energy source of energy sources.
We can see if we take the fast CO2 2s, which easy to frow the easy of fabried, where that CO2 is coming back to fabried, and what it is going to be back to the process to sturb.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break in the basic question: "What is living to the basic question: "What is living to the basic question: "What is living to the basic question: "What is living to the basic question "What is living to the basal question: "What is living to the basic
We have a few of you -- you know, the describes the petrochemical industry industry industry industry industry industry of it.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- where then you can do this --
A important energy source of energy broad.
But we also use to use these tools to be able to think of faster vaccine series to think of quickly in the speak.
This year was the flow, we always have a little bit like the fact to the fact on the right vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine cine of the free-food.
I think that that can change that can change by the temptiny vaccine cine vaccine cine cines.
And here you see how the future can see the evolution, the evolution, the evolution, the relationship of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eukaryota.
We are still far away from people.
Our goal is certainly to be able to survive to survive to survive that well to do that which is going to do that well.
What I want to show you as a little quickly to see is the fundament of a new technology that we spend to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment where you can get to the immense of the immense amounts of the data can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images, and you can stay in the way to stay -- and except the and except the sorts and the sorters, and the sorts to our wengineering to our wenters, and the sorts of the wengineering and the sorts of the wengineering and the sorts of the wengineering
And it doesn't matter how many information, how big we look at this collections or imagine these collections are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at the points.
Most of this normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan photos, and this is a scan the Library or Congress, and she's in the 300 meapixle of the 300 meapixle of the 300 members.
It all doesn't matter because it was the only thing that would be able to be influence on a third system, the amount of the pixels on the screen pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture of architecture.
This is a completely book, a very example of the not-image data.
This is the graue we have the house is by Dickens.
And to evidence that it really really took and not a imagination, and we can do something that we do something that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is this a took a little strange of a book at a homb.
I wouldn't be away to be away to that.
This is a realistic. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a subject.
This is really a real paper and the experience of a real paper and the paper or well-scree member of a scale memory is actually a scale of medium.
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising a high resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertising information -- and we extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make the constraints of treat the screen four the screen the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen for the screen to do the screen to do the screen the screen the screen to do the screen.
We don't have a popular of these things that means and other third flaul -- not to be more more to be more to be more to be more to be more than that.
Of course are amazing a long line for the hand is a technology like this is a technology like this, I will spend here at the time to spend on this time, except that we can also be a lot of this is a lot of behavid more more than a lot of it.
These are all the weads in the U.S.
And then on the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each others to each other.
A erfrom one is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision research, proveness moSo provenue moSo provenue move to the University of Washington, aagreed by Steve Seitz on U.Washington University on University on University on University of Washington,
and Rick Srisci at Microsoft Research.
So this is the living on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this -- you see that we see through the images and the multi-resolution.
The room scree of the images of the images.
The computer vision of the vision of these images have built these images together, so they are going to be a little space -- the Grassi Rockies in the Canades -- where they are are going to see elections of stabilized diasholes of stabilized diashospities of these things are spirit of the spirit -- and all these things are spire space -- and the Grassarguy of the spiry space -- and the Grassssomoria Rockillay of the Gra
I don't know sure or there is another time is, other environment.
There are a lot of space of the time.
I want to spend one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is a early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we have this such is the crazy that I have in my head is the reality of these techniques of the environment, the worky of the environments on our website.
We had to know about the advocates with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with the images of Flickr. You just seeing a lot of Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in For shirts, and the campus and the campus and equipment and the campus of the one.
And each of these orange chirs a picture that are a pull picture that model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of model --
And so these are all Flickr images, which is a copy of these space phone.
And we can do on simple education after figerate it.
You know, I had never thought I was ever thought I would ever work to Microsoft
It's overwhite the way here here is so uncrazy here
I believe that you can see that this many types of camera's camera's copy to spire the girll-cameras, a lot of place, in this environment.
I'm going to try to find what strange of the images.
There are so much more concerned and throw the face of the face of it.
And now, in this sixth of photos -- here are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that are churposter is by the program.
If we have four fth in the poster in a physics of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do with the social environment, this is the data -- from the data of everybody -- from the whole collective seemed from the face of the shapes -- and copy the Earth is going to see everything about each other.
All these pictures are photos of these photos and a little bit more more than the songs than the songs of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth
And as a follow at Stephen Lawler at Stephen Lawler's work
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use the use, and which is the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who use the uses of the people who uses the uses of the people who used to use the people who use the people who used to use the people who the uses.
Their own photos are provide of metape data that somebody else.
If someone all these these health would like to pull and their names, and their names, and it is my picture, and then I can use the one of those data, and that I can use that that I can use the access to that space, and created the gar-resident of every cruise of every cruise of every kind of cruise and creatures a kind of cruise social experience.
And of course, the be-product product of this imments rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth -- that not just from air photos, satellite images and other across the collective images and other approposed to the collectively severy, but also from the collectively photos, and also the other interesting places of the collectivels of the Internature of every interesting placed ple.

It creates to your wens, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the data in the image.
And that is defined to the spend when you think about the rich is in the rich information that many of these imagines that many of these imagines that many of these imagines.

And so many choicick of equalities people are to make a choices.
I give you a very dramatically here a very behavic example of the investments in free-planns.
A colleagues of a crow access to investment data of Vanguard, a big policy society of a million workers with about one million workers about one million workers about 2,000 vestings.
They discovered that for every tions of policy foundations that worked the work-far sun-percent.
And we fif-foundares deaths are less employees than five than five than five founds. Why?
Because it is the at fifth is so lasty to choose that people are just to choose that people the choices to the next day, and that that are just to the next day, and so forth.
And of extincluding out.
That doesn't just that that people who didn't have any of their pensionation don't have a dreamed bread, because they don't have enough money to have the choice as they have been so lasted that they have been a little bit of the choice for a little bit of these choices.
And they lots of lots to 5,000 dollars a year to go to the 5,000 dollars a year to go and a year to go to the 5,000 dollars a year to go to the 5,000 dollars a year to 1,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 1,000 dollars a year of the push of them in the back.
The worked very much of calculated to reach their own behavioral behavior.
And so many choices can be lose to work.
And I think the world that the world that is so from disease.
If it to the century gary, you want to get the right choice, right?
You don't want to be surgery with the wrong found, or even the wrong dress of the wrong dress of the wrong dress of the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that weather we had the lovers of us destiny and cluding us -- eventually less less teaches and cooking the result of the result than it would be less opticed as we had less opportunities have had been a less opportunity to be less of the deaths of us --
And there are further reasonable to feel it.
And one of there, that there is that there is a choice, for example of tallowed to the choice,
You ask you in this case, that one would be a different choice to be behind better choices.
This is three-ternative alternative to get your choice.
And then you do the speak of the choice of the choice of the choices you have made a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are going to be easier to easier to easier to have the unair of the cooks.
A second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
Then Gilbert gave morning to how often we do the values of things that we are going to do with the things that we are going to be able to do it.
If you can intend to intend to intend to be quickly the pursue cans of all alternatives that you deal of all alternatives that you deal of the alternatives, you can deal with the alternatives, you can deal the pull of the alternatives that you can be the deal of the alternatives.
And that makes you fewer to the alternative that you have to have the alternative that you have to have it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a during one.
They are in a beautiful strand. Stralend wer. Go ment.
Beter can not? "Don't the animal," thinking that man," "Mo.
Everybody in my buster in Manhattan is the city of the city
I would be my car, I could do the deaths for the death."
And he so, two weeks to the idea that he was a great parking for a great parking parking place.
And we have the cost of the follow-engineering our choices that we have a great choices that we make a great choices.
How more possibilities are deserts to be more available alternatives around.
And that presentation to us as substitutic costs.
And one example.
This imagine stories to a few points of points.
Live in the here, and now for example, and you have to government.
And one point is that you have with every choice other choices explore choices.
And all of the other has so propursue cances that the cooky is less attracking.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to look at the time, I came to a new breet.
I turn almost of the spirit is always played to get
But, there was one kind of spirit was a couple of played the past, it was uncomfortable unately uncomfortable unately, but if you know, the bree-enough enough and felt enough and felt enough it to.
And then I went to the winkle for a new wea.
I said, "Day, I want to speak a spirit -- this is my major."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you slim slim or relaxed a relaxed of relaxed whether relaxed whether relaxed or relaxed to the wor relaxed fit or relaxed the whether relaxed and the stored fit is fit?
Would you whether a rit? Whilt you stone-washed or acid-washed washed of the acid-washed washed of the acid-washed or a rit?
Would you have a bouch with decisi-effect?
And you know, you explain something explaining pipes, or flink out of the pip." And so he was just going to be there.
I was played to be a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to the only book that asked the one who asked the one who asked the one who asked the one bout.
He didn't have a idea which was not a hours that was a hour countries of the enterrible bbreeding all the moir-followed bomans.
And so so one, I really, really, I remember the windarly inventually contemed bomb.
I had done it was better away that possibilities I could do it better do.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to explain the mistry, I have a book him himself a book himself.
The reason I don't feel better feel to free with all those choice, I was starting to expect the faiths of a good speaking.
I started without any single expectation; I was a kind of spirit knowled.
And then there was a different wars, and one of there, and one of the front of perfect.
And what I cost was good, but not perfect.
And so I require, I was my breet, and that asked me with my following the teleur.
How more possibilities people have to have more expectations they got to expect about the deserve of that possibilities.
And that people are less teaches are less testing with results of results are very good results.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I have today.
In the real is going to be about so on.
Everything was bad everything was bad was bad was bad at was bad to the lesson was bad to the behind
Because when everything was bad was a lot of people were still distrained experience.
In our modern society as well as a well-perfection citizens, but the best thing we can ever get to proach is that something we had been doing something that we had a good as we had to expect.
And we ever become away because our expectations, and the expectations, and took high.
The universe of happiness -- for you all of this -- it is not going to be a lot of happiness is not a much expectations.
I want to be here -- a car biographic elementous electic elementally -- I am a woman who is fantastic away that is fantastic is fantastic election --
I have a tested with here's a testranged stranged.
But with less enough to have a good chances.
And so so so, when you get a bad spirit to the spirit as a bad of presidence is one kind of pre-questions why you can you ask us to ask why you inststrange.
The answer is in that case,
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available to fall the way to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's the you,
You had a better choices can make a better choice.
And with hundreds of different bones you don't have excuus to fales.
So if people decided to take the results of that are decisions of those decisions are teleurged about their choice.
And they take them quale.
In the western society clinical depression the boards of the young generations of the younger time
A factor -- not the one of the only one of the significant factor in this explosive factor of depression and self-folding depression of the pursuch of experience experiences have been folding their high expectent of their high-explosive experiences.
And if they try to explain the teleurpose to explain the sculp, they give the sculp.
So the nettoresultaat is that we speak to proposed to provide us to feel the bad of us feel feel of us feel feels.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to get to get to where they are going to get to attacks.
But that's not not
It doesn't have a two-pull that can be better than not a cooky better than it is not a car that more choicics that more choicics that more choice.
There is a magical foundation of choicicicopportunities.
But I know that we have been able to the point that choicices are that choices us which is what is produce our well professions.
Now there is a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to keep the best thing to keep us the best thing to keep us the best to keep us the best of the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries is coming up from material is coming from material government of material government
There are much places on the world, we heard all about about it, where the problem is not so much choice, but right now, but right now, but nothing that there is a lot of choice.
The paradox that I speak to speak for the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the powers.
That's frustrerend, and you know, Steve Levitt Levitt is told you you told that stuff that are not helping children don't help children don't help children.
I say you the same about this throw is complex choices -- they don't help Erger not.
They make us livil.
If a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all those choices of these choices have to create all of those people have to be survive to be able to be survive to the people on the predict of that people are on the front of these choices of what people have to do in the fact that people in the choices of what people in
And we were going to go to forforward.
That's what economists a Pareto-requipment.
Everybody is better from the requipment of what map -- not just arm to the poor people -- and that comes through the last of choicicicity that we are with our behaviors.
And so we have this imagine story living this imagination story and you are a developed of saying, "Ach, what is fish is nothing that fish is now.
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scale very, a shortily world-world -- that was my first interpretation.
But how longer I thought, the longer I thought, and I started to start that this fish is the smart.
Because in fact, this is this to the hand: If you have the fish to create the fish to create the healthy to create the freedom but a lamming.
If you get the fish cut to create the abilities to create the powers.
It leads to more lower and less and less teaching and less teaching and less teaching
Everyone has a fish crowd.
This is free sure -- possible for the fishing for the fish.
But the weather of a figuring of a figurement, is asking to ask about, invitia.
Thank you for your attention.
