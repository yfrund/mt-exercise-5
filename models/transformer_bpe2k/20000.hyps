Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the pool, which was the pool, which was the past three million years of the vest was about the size of the United States, 40 percent of the United States.
But this is actually the nest of this specific problem because it doesn't showed the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of these.
The ice of the North Pole, in a certain sense, in a sense hart hart of our global climate system.
It's in the summers and croped in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a speech, a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dish in the preventing permanmanent ice in the prevent.
As you see, it's going to go to dark blue.
That's the year, that's the year, the layers.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanmanent, five years or older, is almost like blood, which is almost like blood that is slightly solid here.
In 25 years is the way this is going to be going to this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen flows around the North Icell and there is a very large amount of woman, and there's a very big amount of woman.
Combs with the total amount of diverse in the atmospheres in the atmospher, that can describe if we describe if we described the point of the point of the writing point of the tape point.
In some indeep ming in Alaska signs of methane in Alaska signal on the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another one deep to another ondie.
Why! She's right. The question is the question is to be that will be be able to be that.
A reason for that, this is that this huge was a huge sourcing Greenland from the north of warms.
This is a melect squarter river.
The water volume is the waterme is greater than equivalent than equivalent to the waters.
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea because it's the sea because it turns out of the place is the place where it's in the sea place where it comes in the sea.
These flug are taking flu.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice ice ice mass on ice ice mass on Earth.
For the last months reported scientists that the whole continent now, a negative ice balance is it.
More specific is the ice of the South ple of the South Pole, with a soon of smelt, with some of underwaters.
The whole continent is to six meter sea sliked, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after two after the mass ice mass ice ice mass of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that melses.
In the Anths, is this glestyle of drinking water for this city.
There are more strobs.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snovation of 40 percent in the snowpk of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoices in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions
This global dressing dry has away to a dramatic stip of foresting burning and
And the number of nature, with a number of nature, with an incredible and never seen set and never seen set of speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unkeeping big.
If you look at the both of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 a.m.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille of the Stille of the Stille -- and on each sit from America, and at each sight, there is a drastic daling, there's a vistal daling of the oceans.
The only major caught of the Earth, deforestation, which is burning for 20 percent of phoses of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and steal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest exitors with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban centrales.
But we see a couple of all.
These are the coal-carbon centrales that the bital was annuated in the last years, and where green alternatives were prepared alternatives were present alternatives were for.
There's a political straight to the gang in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industry gave 250 million dollars to promote "shifting spotle-coal coal of promots, which is a conversation of the conversation
And that image did something like something like that.
And then the guy was at home in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally belied.
You probably seen it probably in the news of the news
This is the one after one after one after the single of the most of the single way.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertises of the support square going to be able set around the Kerst was dealing around the Kerst was thise.
Video: "Frosty the stey carbon man is a stay pulled guy.
He's fluence here in America, and he's working here in America, and he cars our economy growth of our economy.
Frosty the urban carbon man is screen with the day
He's paid and well-scree and employees their job and employee."
Here is a big part of the big, in West Virginia from from froming from from froms.
The largest mines of the country is the big blaunched of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship of the slide of the Design Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harround, Harround, Haren't talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the too.
This is a piece of a pull of it.
Video "Big COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason is why the most important purpose to give a giant engage to the light to reward a slight and the defining of the truth of the truth of value carbon.
Fit is not smart is not smart.
We find that the slide is -- and it still seems -- and it still seem.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Schone coal coal, you heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shell.
Fantastic! The machines are making a pretty much as well.
But that's the sound of shone carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the source of stepping cools of the most important causes of the most important warming of the Earth is shaping the remarkable technology that you see here all here.
Look at the way around the shone carbon technology of today today is the day.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternatively alternative alternative al
Video: Stem: America sales in crisis, the economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire running in all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like vile coal and healthy ioil,
But now there's a purerd, new solution to get out of this.
For America of 100 percent of shone electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to work on the work of the work, a plan that took us and the option of the Earth is and the operation of the Earth is a plan to be safer and the operation of the Earth is safer to be safer and the operate warming the earth of the Earth
And eventually a solution that reverse enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the needs to be a
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: The thing to give America to the America to give America
One of the speed ways to make a end of our dependence of old burning to our dependent of old fuels that our planet, to help seep so.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, health, a new energy system
Man 2: Nose investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African old African old African's talk, "If you want to be everything.
If you want to go far about, you want to go to together."
We have to go far far about.
Thank you.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called the flooring back to a update about how that power.
So I am here is the one who didn't heat the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever underneath in the crazy.
It has to be the circumstances that were involved less than a billions than a billions of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second time a second of the second after 600 million times a second time as a second of the second after a billions of the second after a billions of the circumstances that was started to 600 million times a bil
Enorm ambitious, dyes!
This is the machine under Genvy under Genvy
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and and the one thing I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in the diameter in 22 feet in diameter.
Spectacular photo from ATLAS in adding so you can see the scale.
At 10 september set of the first time we put the machine for the first time
This photo bed ATLAS.
And that causes a partnership.
It's a photo of the first particle straight that was going around the LHC was going around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, where in particles in the detector in the detector flowing particles in the detect of the LHC, which was flowing up with a photo of the LHC, and it was going to be foot from
In other words, when we saw that photo 10 September we knew that photograph, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across the biggest of the biggest and saw that the Internet page of it was so far,
That means we made a cultural as a scientific impact of impact as a scientific impact of the tall.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which was to do with these golden vide wheels.
And those draws three thousand of camper when the machine is working on full force.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small draws of your behavior."
They can do that because they can do superago, in the whole lower temperatures.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can remove away that flows that flows flowing the blower than the stream.
In one of the connectivate between the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And then the wire was a wire of the wire was intended to be a thousand of ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still insull if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of over 20 tons of weather, and they were moving about 30 centimeters.
We had about 50 mongs about 50 mongs.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all touched them when they all did.
And now they're back on the way.
Eind map the LHC will be against intack.
We will be able to put it back and we expect measure and we can go on and expect to figure out what the building building building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, these inforces have been able to debate the value of scientific research. It's easy to work.
I think it's a difficult that it's so difficult that we go farther than the LHC.
I think of the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to define the value of the value of his teot experiments of his teacher, his teachers, "None is so dangerous, "None is so dangerous for the progress, and then we have a lot of human mind that we have no new to take mysterious for the world's not a mysterious of the world are not completely new world's lives, and that are not have a new world."
Thank!
I would like to start asking you to ask to you go back to your children at your children at your children play.
When you discovered how to graduate it to gray and then really, they were able to deal with the teaching of the teaching and hanging the conscious relations.
Rut, reads is destrong is destrong with understanding the world to understand us.
If an information is inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- together with my adviser Jeeby Kalanthi -- I started to ask me -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer in the way that we would use a computer that moves on a plate charged that moves on a plate charge of digital finger would be a little bit of the hands of information that we can do information with the hands can constiping information
and ordering as we want to do it?
This question was so so that we decided that we decided to find an answer to build Sifttables.
Cort cooking is a Siftable computer in the size of a cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cows.
They can be moved with the hand they can move each other, they can detect their movement and they decided to detect a screen and wireless and wireless to the hand wireless and wireless they can be able to detect each other.
The point is the physical hands is the physical handles, just like blocks can they put up to gray it.
The venues are Sifttables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that is a more physical resources have a more physical difference, and even of their movement and each other, and even of the way we move them are different new and interactions of discovering and interactions of the way we move them to discover and interactions of the way we move them to discover and interact of the way we move them to explore inter
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video and provide by the opportunity and others and othersing different.
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians as much together, they will put together together, they will interest in the conserves.
And when they become surround, they can also this and what nervous about become nervous
And they feel movement and helling.
We realize that one of the interesting consequences of the interaction of these interactions, the use of all of these interactions, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the color as it was a fluid of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction
In this example three Sifttables emmers to be able to go color in a very emmercial for a very lives, where they become a very very much.
And if we have over, we went back a little bit of the time.
There are some of couple of the education for education of the education of language, mathematics and logics that we want to give the potential to see things quickly the result of incencentive to see the result of instanstance,
And here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacces through a simple computer programmate.
And here we show a game that a cross between Scrabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter in every Sifttable, and then fored in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is very reduced a new series of letters with a new series of letters with a bridge of opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make them and make a video and try to make a video of it.
They were actually away from that.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people don't need instructions have no instructions of needs needs not need.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people to test the test of the other people test to test the test
That's our bottom bate.
And it turns out that he was just the Sifttles.
For him these were only blocks.
Here is a interactive painting painting.
We wanted to be a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that characters of the table.
Here he leave the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done an! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the shake of Sifttables and then the next next to each other, he can respond to each other, and then do with each other, Wak -- Video: Wah!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open fine.
and he decided to destroy how it goes to destroy and he decided to destroye.
Video: The cat flies fly away.
DM: The last example I'm going to show you Is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent a sound produces a sound producing sound and pressure present and pressure prem.
Eender has four different variation, where you can choose what you want to use what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the sounds can be injected so you can do the pattern itself in the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the tackable effects of a very livable effects like reverb and filter.
They are dedicated to a sound and provide by the side.
And the most of the general effects like tempo and volume that are devices are devices on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a liad of pigment, in two Sifttables, to a first pattern,
I put the basline.
Video: DM: I feed a little slavery little bit.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter on the print, so I can affect the effect live the effect lives.
Video: I can do it very quickling it very accelerating the dealing of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now, I cope the filter on the filter of the movie for what's more expression.
Video: I can re-re-re-re-re-re-scious.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise everything to planning, it really very longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And finally, by the dimses of the dimses of the volume Sifttable to left.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is to make a passion of new people's interfaces that are better dested in the way our brains and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area that we are developing with some opportunities that we develop developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attack is to a very new generation of aid resources for the interacting with digital media, which is bring the information to our world like we want.
I thank you of heart for you,
I look at it to you with you to all of you to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long time I was writing for a long time.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career, and career, and I had to see my relationship with my work to see my work to see my work to see my work on the work of relationship to see my work to see my work and career,
It started with a book that I was wrote unlanguage: "Et, Beminners, Biddly, that very contradiction to my first work, and international work all over the world and international is about the whole world and a international seller.
The consequence is that people have to do all over and always tged to do with the purpose as if I do do do it.
And so that took -- telling that -- tell!
People come to me and questions are going to be worried that you can't never have this success you never have to evenar?
Don't you do not afraid you will keep your whole life will be writing a book that people will be able to published a book in the way to get warm.
Don't you do not afraid to this?"
And then you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very very much. But I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I told I was going to be writer -- I was going to be writer
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you get to deal for evidence, that you will go to you?
Don't you do that you have to live on this work that you will ever be able to be something out of your building and that you will be strong on the puin of your building bitters, and you have a mouth of fail?"
Another in that stretation.
In the short comes to the questions on this questions on this is "Ja."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough to be enough for all these things that are enough to be enough for all those things that are enough to be enough for all those things that are enough that are enough to be enough for all those things that are enough that are enough things that are enough to be enough for all those things that are enough is going to be enough for all those
All of the time already already already already already
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know what you're going to do for all of the time.
For sea for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing about me writing myself the last time when the angst that from.
Is it rationel?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be jobs to be working for their mention?
What is so particular about creative processes that we make us worry to make the effects of the mind of the mind of the mind of working at the time.
Take my father. He was scale engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he was working on the 40 years he was working on him or he was not afraid to him or he was not afraid to him that was front of it.
That's what I think is how to do it with your chemist?"
No, there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair emerged by the centuries have been solid to be the reputation of manically.
Prepull that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writer, also other creative people have been able to be the reputation of humans are instable.
And look at the grimp of the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many felt young boy, often by own stiers.
And even those who don't have a suicial suicial suicial seem to be able to be concerned to be able to be concerned to be suicians.
In the last interview for his dead saying Norman Most every one of my books is a piece of my books is a little bit of myself."
That's a little bit about saying about your lives.
But of these kind of spokes we don't look at it.
We all heard it before, and we've heard it all over and spent it with my whole and accepted to the whole of accepty.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is that a poorest and that a artistic inventions will lead to missing the nere.
So I want to ask everybody here today question: can you live with that idea is living to liv?
Do you do that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think about it all a little bit of the mind.
I think of the weather.
And also even even more dangerous.
I don't like to see this century as well.
We can creative mind to creative mind to live a lot better to live.
I know that it's for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in fact,
In fact, the fase that my careers is now in my careers now is now in the fashion is now
Go took you, I'm young years.
I can do even four decade four decades.
And so, probably slikely will be all I published to be seen by the outside of the outside of the work that extraordinary book.
And we're going to be friends under each other, so I can sell it is probably sells you, my greatest success already already already already already behind me.
Yemig, what a idea!
And if you think of you think about it is your knowledge for neine in the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love to me to be working with the work I love with the work I love to the work of the work I love with the work I love to work of the work I love with the work of work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I can just come to the conclusion that I can just go through writing a psychological protection in the process in the process of building in the process of the process of building in the process of the process of the process of the conclusion of the conclusion of all.
I have to write the writing a safe distance between mess, and my conductions and my conversation very understanding of the reactons on my future publishes.
I had been looking for the last year, for the last year,
I am in history of the history and have been doing in other civilizations to see or others to see whether others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative process.
My search a little bit of the old Greeks and Romd.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romestic and Romestic didn't have creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity was a godled-scre, which is a distincluding place to the human engineering and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and believable pleasure of a displace of a display did
The Grieks called these calls of creativity called "demonen"
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that touched him words influist.
The Romestic was a species of the same idea.
And in them was called a guy creative creative spirit was a genius called "genius to be a genius
The funny is that the Romestic is not a genius are not a pient person on inded.
In their policy was a genius was a genius entition of magic godal in the walls of the poorest of the artist.
A little bit like Dobviously,
And when the artists was working on the work was the genius assistance.
And he gave it shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first time about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to protect much narcism.
If you were brilliant work was not going to be all the one.
And everybody knew that was that a invisible genius had to have helped it.
Wed you work on your work was crowd that not just about you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent genia.
Long time that was how in the West creativity was considered to be considered the West
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed changed to change the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There was a whole new idea: the individual ments is the center of the universe is the middle of the universe and all the gods and mysteriiiies.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godal of the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history in the history was talking about artists said that they were not that they had a genius and they had a genius and that they had a genie.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a big freedom.
To let me believe that one person, one single individual that he or she is the securring of the century of the century mystery, of everything that godlabor and the known for a lot of responsibility for a fraile of human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun into set and asks like that.
Ego's become read to gigantic proportions and there are incredible expectable high expectances to prestent performance
And I think this pressure has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists made a lot of artists.
And when that is, and I think is the question: What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a old understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship?
Maybe not do that.
We can do running 500 years rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speech.
And then, in the audience people who recently reduced scientific doubs about the idea that elfell reads with what parts of facts with what parts of artists to inspiring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to me that I'm going to get you in that way.
And yet me ask it down.
Why now?
Why wouldn't we do that thought don't we have to do that convenience to do that convenience that couldn't we have this thought isn't that possible?
It just just as much as much as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the total calcular accountability that decided in the creative process.
And everybody who have to create something that are trying to create -- so in fact, all the attacked all of the attacks -- you know, the creative process is not always rational across rational process is not always rational across rational process to be rational process -- you know, the creative process of the things that creative process here -- you know, the creative process here -- you know, the creative process that is not always rational process to matter -- you know,
And that sometimes almost paranoral feeling.
I have been writing the great American closer.
She's a deal in the nine. Her whole life already writing all of life they pull in the nine.
She told me about her youth on the plately,
Sometimes when she was felt the work was felt to the work was poem a poem close to the country.
It was so one, as if there was a big wave air came up with it.
And so close wave than the country to her country to her country to her it.
She felt the ground under her feet was started to shudness and then her at that point, and then to do one thing to do is to do that.
And then ring to home, and she was going to be close and then they had to do so quickly, and they see paper and paper and paper to package.
When the close by her hand her hand her hand her only was that her only chance to write it.
Sometimes she didn't quickly.
Then ring and ring them, but calculate it not.
And in these moments the close of the poem of him, and then dwed about the fields, looking for in her words -- in her words -- to another closer.
And then I think of it was a lot of the story -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they pull almost of the store of the story --
And then she was looking for the house and paper and paper and paper and paper the paper of her him.
Jue at that potlew she had a potleg of the packs.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she plured the close to the poem from the air.
She pull the close to his tail, and then it back in her body, while she wrote it.
And in that cases came close to the close that was very much in my beautiful of paper but in the entire way.
When I heard that, I heard that, I thought -- what is so far, my creative proces!
That's my creative process, my creative proces! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse of a mouse every day on the same time and then so-up and trans and then blood, and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans on the same time.
But even in that daily swell-swell-like experience.
You will also have to know that feeling that feeling that there is a sense of your record of a source that you can identify impossible to identify impossible to identify impossible to identify that you can identify impossible to be of releasidentify that you can identify intentify and you can iden
What is that then source for fun for fun to source for fun for fun for fun for fun to the sourc?
How can we use it without that we are going to use it without a lot of this?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician's Diian Waits.
I interviewed it a few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life life life was showing the shows of the contemporary artists that from all powers that from all powers that are of all power, and creative impulse of impulses in him of him that refloor.
And with the years was Tom a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more running
And one day he reached in Los Angeles about the fast -- and changed the process of radical radical radical
And as he heard so he heard a cliping of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that do is depply that do is depply -- wells.
It was a beautiful melods and he wanted to fashion that was going to fashion that was going to fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper at a paper to set a tperecorder to set a table to see a tperecorder to sit at a time.
The well-exciting exciting is a little bit of him: "I got the melics, and then keep it and then keep it equivalent to me eight.
I don't have enough, I can't be right."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he was a whole mental process and deed something news.
And he looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the air that I sat the point?"
"Do you really think I can write a song,
And if you really want this song there is a little bit later you have to do that, when I have time for you.
Don't be somebody else else falls.
And then you have neighbors at Leonard Coh." And from that point the process of the process of very different.
The work is the work is the same thing with the dark is the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark is the same thing,
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him of rief when he distinctive process of the geniius of the geniiiian genius
The genius was going to close to the skin, and livered only one.
And so that was not a reason that there was no reason to go to the holding one.
It could be a wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and be the propertile aspect that not was a whole whole of Tom itself was not a whole of Tom itself was a whole whole of Tom itself was a whole whole of Tom itself
That story has changed my way of working changed to work on the way of working changed.
I had been taking profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddom.
And at a point moment I device, I described in despers.
You don't want to be working for you you don't want to do it won't be a terrible disappearing disappoint. The bad book.
Not so-bad bad and really really bad bad and it's really bad bad bad and it's really bad bad bad and it's really really really really bad bad bad and it's really really really bad bad and it's really really really bad bad bad it.
I wanted to do all of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was going to be genius who was going to be a power.
I was going to go from my manuscrips and directly and directly to a very much,
And I said, "Luister thing, we know that if this book is not just the brilliant is not just by me.
You can see that I stop in what I have in the way I have in the way.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you think it's better to do it better, you have to do it.
Snap you don't do that, you know, you don't do that, you'll be thane.
I just writing because that's the once of my work.
Oh, and in the notile of making it is just a lot of dealing that is just a difference."
Tja--- Uentire the right here on this novely is going to be there.
Eastern ago came together in the North African desert people together to deal with Monliance to dance in the sacks.
Urings and hours and hours to the morning.
That was always great, because the dansers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, happened to be something extraordinary --
One of those dansers was then transcendent.
You know, you have seen what I mean, you have ever seen to have seen something like a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night thousands of night everything together.
And suddenly he didn't have a longer just a human being.
In him, under him, above him gloride it.
A godly four four four four government.
And if something destithing, knew people what it was started to clap them and clap them and roping in the crops, God, God, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a nice of historic fact, when the Moren Spane Spanish Spane Spanish Spane, they brought this lives.
The exactly is the chter is the century of "Allah." Allah." Allah." Allah."
And that hear you have the day in fighting and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If an artists in Spanish something impossible or magically, a little inpossible or magically, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil,
Actually, a slimpse of God.
Precions we need.
Lasty is the dance is the dance of the dance of the grandmother to discover on dinary laddly to 11 hours in the morning.
And at that point is a little elder man with debad with debs that will never be able to such highly hights.
And maybe there will never take anybody God will never took a God in dance of dancing in dance.
What does it have to rest the rest of his living to the rest of his liv?
That's difficult.
That's really difficult to sell creative mind for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be a lot of it.
Imagine if you don't have to explain the most impact of your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you don't have seen them while you don't have a little bit of a long time.
When you are ready with it, they are given to somebody else.
And so it was described everything.
I do inventive that I think about the day.
The last months I've worked on a book that solid that will be short. The book where a lot of too long as much too long as a long time.
The opportunity of that illuster progress.
And when my thoughts with me to the hall, I keep the same before the same thing.
Do just you work.
just you do thing, what it's also is the way it is.
If you are too too dance you go to dance you, thank you.
If the godal genius is destroy decided to make a little bit of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful sourcing of the wonderful sourcing of the wonderful sourcing of the wonderful source of the wonderful sourcing of the wonderful source of the wire of the wonderful source of the wire sour
As that not, then, then, then, then, but continue to go through that.
And then then, "Oh, ly!"
I believe that of hard.
"Oly!"How do we don't have a pure of pure human love and propertly, by the way, by the way,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: One!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what it can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digitize of digital code to a new fase of that digital code to a new fase in the biology to design and synthetthesizing and synthesesess.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of ask questions
"What's living is something that I think of a lot of biologists have tried to understand it.
We tried different approaches to left a different approaches to least minimal components.
We're almost 20 years, it's almost 20 years.
When we have sequence, the human genome called the human genome of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask life regenerate regenerate or we can create new life in this digital universe of digital universe.
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome.
And we tried to look at whether we can get a nice smaller genome can be a little bit of the genome.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolic map is relatively display with the unnership,
Live me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all, it's very unlikely that this was very unliving cell that this was a living cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell cell that this was a living cell cell cell that this would be a living cell cell cell cell cell that this was very
And we decided to do that the only route of the most route to synthetism this chromosome, so that we could deal with the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started to ask a chromosome,
Sat the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, a chromosome, can we do that,
A chromosome, the way, a chromosome, by the way, a chemically,
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accell is accelerate on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of the geneti
And our last point it would take a case in a exponential curve.
We're going to started to be over 15 years ago.
There were some couple of stage for a few stage for a bio-ethical action to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult it.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the pull of the pularly matching of it.
So we had to make a new method for the tiny of these little pieces and corrigate all the front of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of chicks, the front of the front of the front of the chicks.
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning of when we stop chemical chemical stant chemical code in the bacteria called the genetic code and virral particles and virral particles and make viral particles and make viral particles are going to make a viral particles and virtually are going to make the bacteria little bit of the bacteria little bit of
The virtually were going to solve when they came back and then they came back and killed the E.
I was going to be in speaking with the oil industry, and I said that model but all to do it.
They laugh more than you.
And so we think this situation is a situation in which the software can build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of greater --
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetttle so that we could varial -- so we could varial --
to understand what the stuff that are working components of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start start with digital information in the computer than needs to be very accurafly accurafly accurae.
When we first asked this genome for the first time in 1995, the deal with a front of one past a past period a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 folds. If we had the original sequence sequence of sequence.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to be surface with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so much like this, we have to build design so that we have to design so that we have to design so that they can do together to design so that they can be able to design so that they can be together.
We design unique parts in the parts in here.
And you may have read water market that we stop in the way.
Bet, we have a four lettery genetic code: A, G, G, and T.
Trios of those letters cos for run away to run away -- that there is a little bit of the aminoxygen for every aminoxys.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thought.
And in the and, we just got a lot of the tom.
Some of them were telegled that there was no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairs and put together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces of pinking five to 7,000 letters were going to be able to 7,000 letters long, and you have a lot of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stage sokpled a floor, so we could sequence sequences them because we could create a process that very robuy robbust -- that will be very robuying you see.
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration.
So this is looking like a basketbalfinal finale.
And soon as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow so easy more in E.
That expends the expends of all modern tools of the modern cular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We had a mechanism that "homolo-recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can feet.
Here's an example of that.
There's a organism called Deinocococcus radiation called Deinocococcus radiation to radiation on the radiation of radiation to the radiation of radiation
And that is the top panel, seen chromosome, sh my chromosome.
12 ots 24 hours later he took it back in each other, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be dry sun-dry to-dry did.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there can be life in space can premove in space can promove to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been sent by the way, there is a lot of the way.
Here's a deal microphto the molecule that we have made with this processes -- actually made with these processes -- actually actually with the right design of the stuff with the right design of the pieces of stuff that we did in it.
And then you know, they put them automatically from.
This is not electron-microscope photograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes of the period of six seconds
This is the publication that we spent until we extend to speak.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, it's only about 142 pages just to press the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with the genetic code with the genetic code with the genetions of the
Now, how do we start, how do we started? How do we do it? How do we do it?
With a virus is it's obvious.
And by a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a cell of eukaryots, as wheps you just know the cell and do another in and that's what you know when you do it as close.
And in the bacteriif-to-chromosome, and we have been shown in the cell, but we have unliked unlantation of a chromosome.
We have a chromosome, we've got a chromosome.
These are about so far away from each other.
We added some extra little bit so that we could select for this chromosome.
We have been destroymes to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell, and you will be very advanced to be a very advanced here -- the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to talk to about it but we tried to solid the process of what happens.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all kinds of these kinds of kinds of chromosome, or a third chromosome, or a third of thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution is proposed to be a lot of biology has not been a lot of biology has been crazy.
There are enzymes that restriction are enzymes called DNA devices that actually DNA device.
The chromosome, the chromosome.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stopped -- well, right.
It was expression, and it recognize the other chromosome, and then we had a strange of material, and we had just the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of one species of the species of the species of the new species, and changed that new software that we had stopped in the cell we had stop.
All the proteins changed the membranes changed -- when we changed the genetic code was changed exactly where it was changed.
This is a major sounds like genomics alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changed things like this.
Good already before, I paying earlier that this is not a creation of a majorian explosion of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid a new version of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of new species of scale design and making new kinds of them in this digital design is in this digital design of digital design is basical.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs to look at what is needed is.
We're going to go in ses-a-a-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet,
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 460s, that there are four four are four four there.
We have to have food with food, with food, with the heavy of water medicine, fuel for the six-a-a-half billion.
That's a disappoint to do that for now.
We use five billion ton coal ton coal of five billion of living
That's 100 miloons of ves: 100 miloons of ves:
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace that is going to be a tremendous challenge of challenge challenge
Then of course, of course, all those carbon dioxide of the far.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a database of 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronic industry had only a dog of different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity that comes out of the diversity of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity of the diversity of electrons,
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of these, they have techniques to do so called combination genomics to do so on.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes.
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing processes to create octance or medicines to produce or medicine with a little team of team -- we can change more molecular than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select selecters, chemical or fatbality, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design software where we work, so you can really go on the computer and can go to the computer and a new kind of in the computer can design in the computer can design
We don't know how it's going to see out of how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of what their genetic code of disease.
We four fourth generation of fuels.
On the ground-foundly ethanol of you have seen a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come up from coming out of sugar, to more highly highly highly sugars like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food such of food and the availability to lay the condition, and the availability to be a food provided and so we are cellells to design that we do the first source and we think we are the first fourth of fuels and we think we are the first four months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries of discoveries we have all kinds of other methods.
This is a organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deepiczea, about 2.5 miles in coking heart temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen and the energy source fun hydrogen sourcing
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take a pipell through pipes through pipes that CO2 is fabried, where that CO2 to burn to fuel this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is living in living to the basal question: "What is living in the basal question: "What is living in a short of time.
We have realize you know -- have the dealing does, the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED when you can't do this at TED where?
A major energy energy source of energy source
But we are also using these tools of working tools to think about serions of vaccines vaccines of vaccess.
This year, there was the floor, we always just walking back the fites when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change from textomored vaccines to make combined vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see the future will be changing the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are more distant to prove people.
Our goal is certainly to conduct a chance to be able to convulation that might be able to do that well. Thank you.
What I want to show you as a little bit like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft to Microsoft a year ago.
And it's a surroundation in which you local or at the distance of immense data can work with immense data can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can keep down here at all, and invent, and challenge and challenge and the sorters to our wish to our wish to our wish to our wish and our sorters.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections are or images or images are of images or images are of the collections or images.
Most of them are normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 meapixely.
It doesn't matter because it makes the only thing that would be able to influence the prestations of the same way in a garden system is the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-picture of the data.
This is the gradual house is by Dickens. Each colm is a head piece.
To prove that it is really text that it's really text and not a imagination, we can do something that is really text is not a picture.
And perhaps this is a little bit strange of strange is a e-book on it.
I wouldn't be adapty.
This is a realistic example of the Guardian example of The Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a support deal.
This is really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is a scale medium of a real medium is a scaling medium of a real paper and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper and the experience of
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian excited.
We made a nice advertising of high resolution -- a lot higher than a normaal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specification.
And these ideas can really make for worrying that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen of the screen to do the screen.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups more more and other supposed -- not needed to be more than needed to be more than needed to be more than needed to be more than needed to be more more than needed to be more than that.
Of course are agricultural cards for the hand is a technology like this, I will not spend on this field -- I don't spend a lot of time to this field to this field even more than a lot of a lot of time.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
On the top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else now.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques connected with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer-vision research, proventing to the University of Washington by Steve Seitz at U.Washington U.Ws.
and Rick Srick Sriski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we do this, we can experience the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution to experience this way.
The room of the images of the images has been here meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been building these images together with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized stabilized diasows or photograph or panama images.
I don't know if there is another time or there is other environments.
There are a lot of space televisier.
I want to like one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we worked in my hehead is the worky power of these technique power of techniques that are the working at the environments on our website.
We had to do do with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dessage of the Notre Dave in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirrchirs a image of this model turns out of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model again.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are in this way space teleyed.
And we can do in simple way way we can do it.
You know, I had never thought that I would never work.
It's overwheling is so dealing to be so unforth.
I believe you can see that this fielth cameras are cameras are cameras to mirror seflexcameras a big number of thing, a big number of thing, a big number of these,
I'll try to find a little bit strange images
There are so many works so much more than that.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churns wrong by the program.
If we divide the poster in a physical picture of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entive memory of how to the so, the Earth is looked at each other.
All these photographs are considered together a very little bigger than the som of the parts of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth is
As a consequence on Stephen Lawler on the work of work is the Virtual Aard.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it as it uses the prevent of the people who use it.
Their own photographs of metap-data that somebody else inved.
If somebody would want to do already and their names and their names and their names and then my photographs of the Notre Dame is rich that data, and I can use as a access to the space, which metape that metape of every photographs of cross this kind of cruise and created with this kind of cruise and created social experience.
And of course, it's the be-product of this imments rich virtually rich virtually model of every interesting place on Earth, which not only from air photographs, satellite images and other applies is destroyed from the collectively photographs and other applying from the collectively photographs and other apply of the collectively pull ptures, and of course point of the collectively pipments of course pull and of course ptures,
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you do is possible to do you can do as well, in the next years, all of those images that are dealing by everybody in the world can copy?
BA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovered.
It creates to your wish your wiss, hyperlinks between images.
And it makes the basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that is defining with exciting when you think about the richchales of semantic information that many of these images are available to have a lot of these images are available to be available to be available to be available to be available to be available to the richchches of these images are available to do that.
When you look at the web on the Web b, then you have a sheading and the text on the webpage page of information about what the image is much about what the image of the image of the image of the image of information about what the image of the image of information about what the image of information is what the image of information about what the image of information is about what the image is going to be a far,
What if you look at that image copped to imagination for your imagination?
And then the number of underling semantic connections and the amount rich is rich of that comes out of the major networks is a classic networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.
One of the intense pleasure of events and events of eventually research, the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live in the wind, which are not for, in the wind, the prod, the profited stone in the wind, the profitting in the wind, the profiters.
The science that Jaay is still still preventing the Milky galaxy is still traveling the myths of Inextending to meaning is actually in the Himalay boodhists still are still working on the breathing is still working on the breakh of Dhar, you remember the anthropology: the world in which we don't have in a shapology of an absolute sicky is just one model of the reality, but is not just a few people have a single shapological accounterness of the workle shapologyingly shapology:
the consequence of a devices that allowed to have generions of our ancestors of generations ago.
Of course, we are all the same applicate the same adapted born of the world.
We are all inductive crites all of inducation.
And then with the inverbal shifting through the death.
So it can't be surprising that we all of them, dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique calcular case of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of dance in every different culture.
Or now is about the Penan in the Borneo, or the Vood-Car-death acolites in Haiti, or the freeders in the Kaisut in North Kaisut in North Kenya, the Curch of the Sahara. This is the Carahara. This is the hart of the Sahara.

They all learn us that we can be different that we can think of the earth can be able to orions of orions in orions of orions are going to be able to orions are different to be different, different to be able to think of the earth of us can be able to think that we can be orions of the earth can be able to orions of orions are learning us to be able to think that we can be able to be otherwise.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen shapes the intelliable cultures in the world a Web of spiritual and culture, and culture, and the just is as important as important is as important as the biological lives, the biosphere.
This cultural livweb you can imagine, you can imagine,
The foot of the foot of the foot of all the thoughts as the totally of all thoughts, ideas, ideas, ideas, and inspirations and intuitions are prevent by the human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The foot is the big nalature is the big nalthy of humanity.
She's the symbolding of all that we are and all of that we can be amazing news and all of that we can be amazing animals.
like the biosphere is the biosphere is the enos; it's event, and even in a lot of larger mate.
No biologist would be during that least half of all kinds of all kinds of all kinds of the species of extinction because that's simply not true.
And that is the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even in the neighbors of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of tales.
And when everybody here was born born there, there were sixousand of talks on Earth was in the globes of the part.
A language is more than her words, or her grammatical rules.
A language is a flows of the human selling of the human soul.
It's the free-fer culture that the soul of every unique culture the material of the world reaching of the world reach.
Every language is a century language is a century dishep, a purpose of spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand of talks today is the day of not more in children are fluistered in the children in the children
They don't have a long time.
Effective means that unless a change, that they are already dead.
Is there something like to be a little bit of the pilled by sil, the last of your people, no opportunity to spend your language or the reduction of the ancient or the reward of the kids have to see the kids have to see the kids of the kids?
And the reciions that tergene is somewhere in the device every two weeks somewhere on the Earth, because every two weeks and with him in the last letter of an old language of an old language of an old language.
Some of you say, "Well the world don't have better place to be better place when we all have the same language of the same language of the same language of you, let's take Yoruba take. Or Kantones. Or Kantones.
Or Kogi.' You will realize how it would be not have your own language.
So what I want to do is to do today is to regular by the event, which has to be a photograph, which has to be lost your image is going to be lost of the far.
Many of us forgotten that when I have to talk about another way of being a lot of different ways of all, I really have a very different ways.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about you about some questions that I have been able to talk about a book of the book of the book
And you can see paralls with information of other sources.
I think I was a little bit of a little bit of the whed that you can have mist.
I want to start with the "official dog."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the Western indualized society.
And that official dogma is awma is as a follow-to-periol of our citizens at the highest level, we need to get them so much as possible to give them so much as possible freedom.
Freedom is a big good good is a major of the human beings of the human exist.
And the venappear freedom, to acting us to do a higher which is to do a higher wheels without inment.
The ultimate freedom, we find in choice.
More choices hold in that people have more freedom.
And more freedomatically means automatically means more well.
This is so die-wortely in our society that nobody would be pulled to doubs.
And in fact, this dead is this dogma step of spoke --
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about threat left.
And the first time that 175 size and tware in my supermarkets different in my supermarkets of extra-virtue virtually get different bas as a lot of extraordinary and then then two bas as a lot of time.
And then you can make task of tallowed to make a lot of 175 species for you, nothing about 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked from my supermarket.
Look at electronics store you can do itself your strong constitute -- loud speakers, cassetttesple of race, cassetttesple of race.
And if you have electronics you can choose from this attackle of this attle.
You can be a half million different systems, with parts of them together, with parts of the store.
Live -- then you have a lot of choices a lot of choice.
At another example -- communication.
When I was young years ago, you could all all kinds of the phone services of the things that Ma Bell.
You didn't hurt it. You didn't check it.
And that was the way the advantage that it never piece of it.
And that time is predictable.
And so there are a lot of different across there are a lot of different across of different across of different across
And in order of cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neushick and cracy and crack-breaking fun break fuels.

No,
It's not possible to buy a mobly mobly too much to buy that doesn't do too much too much too much to buy
And in aspects of life that are much more important, the damaf of stuff, is this explosive is this explosive is a fact.
And the United States -- it's not in the United States is not that you have to go to the doctors and you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and then you can do to do A thing, or we can do Bet, or we can do Br.
A front of these fores and didly.
By has this prevent and navil?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is you find out of what like you?"
And the doctor says, "A prevent and then Bi, and Bive this prevent and disapped.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was told me what would you do do you do do do this?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own invitial of patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decisions of decipation of things -- the doctors of things -- the doctor -- the doctor, somebody whose is free and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient. For recipatient mes.
Good described that nere, because the goal group of it, because the goal group of you.
Why do do do if we can't get them to copy?
Because they think we are going to be able to do the next morning to ask that other mark is to ask that other mark,
Our identity, yet a ingrace of us are now over, now transform over, as you can see on choices like you can see on this slides in this slides of choices --
Our identitity is is lose of our background.
We like to find ourselves, we often like that.
And every morning, you have to think about what you want to be able to think about what person you want to be able to think of the person you want to be able to think about what person you want to be concerned to be about what person you want to be able to think about what person you want to be able to think about what person you want to be able to be con
Let's talk about the mark, the soil --
There is a time that free-free-everybody else there was a time of them that you possible to be as quickly, and then as soon as possible to children started to children started to children beginning.
The only thing was the only choice was with while, not when and what you did.
And now free-free-up for the opportunity to the way.
I give you a little bit of intelligent students, which I was evil, I was evil.
They don't have a little heay or away or agreed in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Sould I trust or not? Salthough I marries?
Or do I wait? Do I first kids, or a care?"
These are everything about these are all single questions.
They go through to them to a answer to them as this means that they don't have all their house work and then no good calls.
And they have the same living questions. These are important questions.
And then we come to work. Carl just already all of that technology is allowing us to work every minute of every day is also in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, that I love secret that I love secret --
I don't like that, because I want to keep a place for myself.
But good, that extremely choices of work in that we are still asking us to the question, or we go to and whether we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbaltbaltbaltch of our sone, with us and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry.
And even if they all argue from the way from those task of those task of questions, "Am I asked this phone, "Am I responsibility?
As I do this emailing for this is? Am I writing this letter writing and writing this letter of the letter of the fre?"
And even if the answer is the answer of the football of our son in a very different way.
And what we look at the great, the small of the big, materialistic things, living is a issue of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose.
And that was the world used to be there was asked to the world there.
There were a little choices but not everything was a issue of choose of choose
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad this?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about it is a lot of it, what is bad is bad about it.
And that massive choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings.
A very contradictions is that it first time is that it was working than freedom.
And with so many choices people are the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically, a very dramatically, of a very dramatically, to invest investments in the free-plans.
A college of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a major policy society with about one million employees to about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vestigate about 2,000 vestigate about 2,000 vestigate of fings.
They discovered that for every tions of them disappoint that worked very far away that worked about, the participiped two percent determine of the works.
And when we were able to focus on the five percent less employees than five to five than five founds. Why?
Because it is foundly farise is so difficult that people just explaining the choice to the next day, and that sure that I think that we can just get the next day, and so on.
And of course comes down.
That doesn't mean that people don't have a dry depensionate to eat the time they have not been enough money because they have enough money to have enough money was so hard so hard to have a little bit of the choice as we have been a lot of dishead.
And they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year, for their nose nose for the nose of the time.
The worked very much about that took was to double their own contribute to double their own contributes to be able to dish their own contributes to be able to divide their own contributes to be able to dish their own contributes to be a connected.
So many choices can be lost of choices can work.
And I think the world that the world looks like that.
If it goes to go to the century -- you want to do very very much like the right choicky?
You don't want to be solved with the wrong found, or even the wrong foundation.
That's the first effect. The second thing is that we had to do the lost of our dish laming and choose eventually less fewer and eventually less fewer than the case, when we had less options are when we had had been had.
There are multiple reasons for to do do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be the choices that the choice was not perfect.
You know, you assume that one would have been better choice better.
This dry drought alternative is that you get to get your choice.
And then then you spend up to the full of the choice that you have made you have made a good choice.
How more options are going to be able to be easier to have a spike of unit that election of the geots of option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depending on the things that we dependent of things we are comparing with the things that we comparate it.
If you can invest many alternatives you can invest the attractivity of all the alternatives that you dealt the points that you would.
That makes you fewer tape with the alternative that you have chose your choes.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is a single is in the Hamptons.
They have a throwing.
They are a wonderful strand. Straling road. Straling in the sight.
Don't be right? "Don't be the gusty is thinking gusty.
Everybody in my neighbor, in Manhattan is the city of expensive.
I could do my car for the door, for the door,
And he's two weeks to two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking parking parking place a great parking parking place a great parking place of parking place for a great parking place of it.
And the substitute cost of the people, the full of our choices that we have, even if we make a wonderful choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are more alternatives.
And those presenting to us as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image store is going to be a number of points.
Life in the and now now now and now you have to considered things are not going to be sure things like that.
And another point is that you have a point of choice other choices extension.
And all of the other has so attraction to be costs option the geots of option is being focus on the way to be able to be involved in it.
And third is the escalation of expecially expected.
I came to this is in my searching for a new book to a new book
I turn almost always spirit always spirit to be true.
Bose there was only one kind of stuff, and you check it up, and you couldn't be incredibly uncomfortable to be uncomfortable, but if you were the book long, and often enough and often enough and often enough it to.
And after the wince: I went to the winck for a new.
And I said, "Then, I want to be a stuff, this is my me."
And the wineer said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, or relaxed fit or relaxed fit is fit --
Wilt you whether a rhy? Wilt you were stone-washed or acid-washe?
Do you have a bouch of the breedom?
Wilt you something like pipe, or flink or flink out, you know, pipes." And so he was just going to be there.
I was spotles from that. And after a while I said, "I want the only book that asked up the only book that asked up to the first one."
He had no idea which book that was a hour for a hour for an hour for a hour for a hour for a hour for the point of the power to passion.
And so then, I think I can do a set of the winkle with a pull of the breet.
I had done better before. Do all of those possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Or do this on myself, I wrote this book for a book of it.
The reason I didn't feel better feeling with all of the choice, I started to expect more to expect the speed of a good job.
I started without any of the expectation, because I just started to do one kind of stuff.
And then there was different war, and one of them would be perfect.
And what I bought was well-perfect.
And so I was a little bird with my bird to expect my expect and that point.
How more possibilities people have been able to expect more than farm about the deservices of that possibilities of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tacking people are less with results, even if the good results.
Marketings people don't know this is not known to know this.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about that I'm talking about about
And in the really is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse to be surprising experience surprising experience.
In our modern society, we can we expect as perfectly perfection perfection perfection, but the best thing we can ever achieve that something is so good as well as we were expected to be as well as we were expected to be a good as well.
Nonce we have surprisingly, because our expectations, my expectations, are high-high.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you, all of you have come to be a lot of happiness is not too much expect too much much expect too much expect to be too much as much as well.
I want to do do -- a little bit -- a little bit of a car-biographic element, I am with a woman who is really fantastic.
I don't have a little less joy joined with less peacious job.
But with less enough to take a good opportunity.
And finally, when you have a bad bad at the point of the stuck is like one kind of prehanced if you are the questions of prehand, you can do intests you can deal with the question.
The answer is that case just simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bits are available to be available to fall, who's is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just so simple.
You had a better choice chose chose of choice.
With hundreds of different balthy balthy to failure.
So when people decided to take decisions as the results of those decides are good to be good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the only only onial -- not the only thing that are such a significant factor in this explosive is that people often telekey have been so often telegle explosive experiences of their high-explosive experience of high explosive to the pursus of them are very high explosive to this
And when they try to explain the teleurpose to explain themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettoring is that we were talking about it, so that we fellow objectively to feeling.
As a convenient.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be awling for where everybody is going to be and.
But that's not not the way it isn't it.
It doesn't have a doubt that can choose better than not cannot choose better than not have automatically that more choices is more choices is better choices is better choices that is more choices can be better choices better is more choices better choices that is more choices are more choices than you can't choose ch
There's a magic ground: I don't know about choices I don't know.
But I know we are already for a long time for the point that choices us well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best thing to keep the best thing to keep the best thing to be able to be the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries come out of material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about what we heard about that the problem is not so much choice, but right now.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so for the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the way of Wests.
That's frustrers, and though this: Steve Levitt has to told you that expensive and installering kids are not helping kids are not helping your money.
I say you about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help not, they were hard.
They make us living.
And if a part of what people in our society to make all of these choices to make all those choices to be survive to few options, life would be living to live in life.
And we have lived to be on it.
That's what economists is a Pareto-improve to call it.
Everybody is better by reverse -- not just poor people -- not just poor people -- and that comes through the last of choices that we are with our lives.
And finally, if you remember this image story of you, if you are developed the same time you say, "Ach, what does fish is fish there no?
None is possible in a fish com."
A scral imagination, a shortile worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this fish is dealing this fish is dealt the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you have the fish crazy to create opportunities to create opportunities to create a freedom.
If you get the fishing to create opportunities to create less too, you get less too.
It leads to more lost and less tester and less tester and less tester
Everybody has a fish call.
This is freedom, even to be a constitution -- possible for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the desireth of a figures of a figure, dedistributed, device, divided unitial is unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
