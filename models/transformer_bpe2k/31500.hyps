Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the polar Coa's pool, which had about the pooly of the United Statand of the United Statand was 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the serving the nighting of this specific problem because it doesn't show the dish of the ice of ice that ice doesn't show the dish of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a certain sense, in the clopperiod of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in summer.
The next slide that I shows is a accelerating what the last 25 years.
The permanent, the permanent,
As you can see, it out to dark out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
And the so-called ice ice ice ice ice or older, five years or older, is almost like blood, that is set out of the body is taking here.
In 25 years of this to this toward to this for.
And that is a problem because the frozen frozen around the Northern Icell warms, and there is a very large amount of carbon and it is a very large amount of carbon and then it was dead, by microbes in methane.
Consider the total amount of distincigation in the atmosphere, that could double that could double that amount of distincluding the crowd.
In some indeep inside in Alaska sign in Alaska sign-rely methane in the water.
Last winter was going to be called Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different from the University of the University of the University of the Universit
Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question is to be that we will be that will be that we will be that
A reason for that, this is that these huge called warm-warm-bron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melectwaterriver riger.
The waterme is the waterme is the greater than oom.
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soil is because the landia, it's melting the place where it comes in the sea.
These flow out of the flow and flight.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on the Earth.
And last month reported to report scientists that all continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice in the West of the South Pole, very quickly, very quickly underwatering a few underwatering.
The whole continent state for six meters -- just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after the biggest ice mass, and there were new now, who were still glaciers were going to be glaciers
40 percent of the world population is the help of his drinking water from that smell time.
In the Andes, this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more flows up now.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a four of 40 percent in the snowe of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions at the time.
This global dream of drought has led to a dramatic stying,
And the number of course all around the world is spent with an incredible and never seen a speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years, than in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely untenance.
And if you look at the bottom of a historical context what you can see here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons to CO2 every 24 hours, every 24 hours,
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille of the Stille Ocean, and every side, and every single side, and every single side, there's a drastic dality of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great causes of the global warming, nee-deforestation, which is to deforest for 20 percent of fossil fuels, it's burning from fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the largest extent ters, with China.
And there was a proposing to build a lot more urban carbon centrales.
But we see a circumulate
These are the coal-carbon carbon which the bone of which the bone of the bone alternatives were forget where green alternatives were forget
There is a political fight in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industiry gave 250 million dollars to promote "scue cool to promote "scree coal coal of coal of coal of coal of the contraction of the contract.
And that image did to me think about something like that.
And the urster became in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons model.
You probably seen it in the news of the news of the news
This is the biggest of one after the biggest fall of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising lines of the bona set of the cost-cooking was the Kerstians.
Video: "Frosty the stepy of carbon man is a stay up, and the guy.
He's overliquid to America, and he cares here in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the steph carbon with the day.
He's paid and so he was paid and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from days.
The biggest mines of the country is the great blaunched of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship me to be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they talk about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, for Klimate.
This is a piece of one of them.
Video "Be COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threats for our business.
That's why it's the reason the most important goal is to give a giant engaging to the light to add a recline for the light and bring the light and the destroyed of the bondity of the stone of the bondity of the stone of carbon.
Fiit is, steencoal is not smart.
We find that the clean -- and it still catches up -- and it still liked.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
And let that just about our this.
Video: Schone of these coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern shoot carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines are pretty much a little bit of a lays.
But that's the sound of clean cooling technology.
And despite the fact that the considered of crossing causes of the main causes of the global warming, the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at good around this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Eindically the positive alternative alternative alternative alsey, and that in national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel el of fossil fuel and impulled oil, and healthy oil,
But now there's a purple new solution to get out of this.
For America is 100 percent of clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get to the work to get to work to the work, a plan that safer and the global warming.
And finally, a solution that considered enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.

Man 2: Nonce investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speaking word that says, "If you want to be quickly.
If you want to go far far far abou."
We have to go far far far about.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with an update about how this machine works.
So I am here for those who were not going to be the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever such such a mile in entertain 27 miles in entertain entertain the end.
It has to be the conditions that were attacking the condition, less than a billions of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, so, set up!
This is the machine underneath Genevil.
We took photographs of that mini-Bangs inside detectors and and this is the one where I work. It's called ATLAS detector -- 44 meters was wider in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in connection so that you can see the scale.
And at 10 September last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That caught for a party,
It's a picture of the first particle of particle that was all around the way around the LHC went around LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which was flowing particles in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September we knew that was working the machine is a huge overcome a huge over.
I don't know if this was the biggest across the biggest across the Internet page and saw that the Internet page.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientistic impact --
And a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was doing with these golden behaviors.
And they were 13 thousand amping 13 thousand amping the entire power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they have superago, because they are superago.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that are able float the astone.
In one of the connectivated between nine in the LHC, was a construction of the LHC, was a construction error.
And it was going to be something called the wire was something like electrical resistant to that 13 thousand amping 13 thousand amping 13 thousand amping it was something like 13 thousand amping electrical resistance to the 13 thousand amping it was something like 13 thousand ample of them was going to be something called called the wire of the wir
This was the result.
This is still impression to be when you realize that those magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the magnets were moving to be moved about 30 inches.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all repair of them in the way that we all took them up.
Now they are back to the way.
Eind mold, the LHC again.
We will take it back and we expect it and we expect to measure it to go out and expect to figure out what the building is building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, who have started accidents the debate again to the debate research of scientific research for the value of the scientific resed.
I think it's the fact that it's so difficult that we go further than it is the value of things like the LHC.
I let me let the last words of English scientist Humphand, I would have been defined to defend the obvious experiments of his learning experiments of his learning was Michael Faraday, this said, "thing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind to take the human mind to take our images of science of science of science of science of science of science of science that there are no new world's indictive world that there are no new world."
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you back to your children back to your children's time.
And when you discover how to grab it up and pages, and they cked up and covered up and consciously to the case with the and hanging from space-relations.
Ruimtely insight is very strong to understand the world to us
And if a information that is inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- with my advisur Pattion and my fashion Jeeding Kalanithi -- what if we were able to ask me to ask -- what if we use a computer of the environmental miracy that moves on a plate deser of individual free that moves on a plate deset of individual information with the information of information
and can ordered ordering the way we want?
These question held us so that we decided to find an answer to the building of Siftables.
Sort was a Siftable computer is an interactive computer in a cooky.
They can move with the hand, they can feel together, they can feel their movement and they decided to detect them a screen and wireless contact of the wireless of the condition.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handeling blocks can they get to move by the blocks to grab it by grab.
And the top of the Siftooles an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is a more physical differences, a more physical differences, and then consciously of their movement and even from each other, and even of the way we move, there are different new and nice interactions of them and exploring new and nice interactions of their moving and explore interactions of their moving and a nice of the way we move, and
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that has been playing by the side, which is plays and others and others and others to play a cell of the crossing.
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will be put together, they will interest in the other thing.
And if they are surround, they can also notice this and what nervous.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday is the use of the case of the color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the color as it was a fluid ling of the interaction,
In this example three Siftmers of emmers for and I can use them to go color in a very empty in a very empty of the color in a very empty of the cross-up.
And if we did three, we went back to the back.
There are some of the cooperation for education, especially play -- especially play -- mathematics and logic where we want to give people the ability to be able to give things quickly immediately fast and the result of immediately.
So here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci accountable to account programative --
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get around a randomly literally get around the wheels on every Siftable, and you know, controlled in a dictionary book.
After about 30 seconds it is very rescue and appearing a new series of letters with a byholds.
Thank you.
These are some of kids on the Media Lab, and I sleeping them out and make them out out and make them out out and make a video.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions.
And all you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people test the test of the other people test
That's our youngest bombs tester, righting the bottom.
And it turns out that he could be able to pipate the Siftoo.
For him these were only blocks.
Here is an interactive painting.
We wanted to do a platform for learning from language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstry.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that characters of the table.
Here he let the sun emerged up here
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God daan! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the scue of Siftables and the next to one to each other, he can response to do the carakters with each other -- Video: Waf!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed with a sound producing sound that we developed with a sound produces like the lead, bass and drum.
Eennion, and every piations, where you can choose what you want to use which you want to use what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the argue that you can be injected to the pattern itself in the pattern itself
You put a sound in the pattern by the attacks of a very very likely to be available effects like reverb and filter.
They are being sound to a sound and add by the side.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are taken up on the whole pattern to the entire pattern at the entire pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftooles, to a first pattern to a first pattern by a first pattern,
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: DM: Now I add a little slagwork.
Video: DM: And now I copy the filter of the drums, so I can influence the effect live the effect of living the effect of living to the effect of the business of the drums,
Video: DM: I can cut it very acceling the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now, I coping the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescue the pattern as the plays.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything to do to improvise and make it very shorter as I want.
And with the finally ended up the dimessage by the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to the left Siftoo.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion out of the passion of making new people to make new people better interfaces that have been dested in the way our brains and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we developed in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation to interact with digital media, which bring the information to our world like we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with all of you all of you.
I'm writing.
Builds writing my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life long as I was to write and I don't think that ever change.
And yet there is a propertly, something happened in my life and career and career and career with my relationship with my work to see my work.
It started a book that I wrote unlongs, a memoire: "E, Biddly, "E, Bidd," which is very very contrasted to my first work, and an international exister to my first work.
And the consequence is that people now have to be tought like I did to have to be tough.
And that is what -- gets do!
People come to me and ask to me and ask to me and ask you that success, you can't be able to equivalent this succes?
Don't you imagine that you will stay your whole life but never have a book such a book such published to be walk to walk to walk to walk to walk to write your whole life will write to write your whole life will write to write you will write you will write to write your whole life but never write you
Don't you imagine there?"
And I think that you know you.
Of course, that would be very of, but I remember about 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was a teenager, I was going to become a degree -- I was going to become a writer.
People said, "Do you don't get success.
Don't you imagine to be frightening, that you will go to the such of it.
Don't you imagine your life on this work, and you will be able to do something out of the things that you will died in your broken on the puin of your broken with your mouth with your mouth with your mouth of fail?"
Something in that stretch --
And in the short comes to this questions on this no, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all of these things that are called called "
All of the time.
But I am also for a lot of other things afraid to know what to do.
For example, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing myself is writing myself the last time where the angst comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be working for the work for where they have been taken to their mention?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make sure to the effects of the minesses of the minesses of minesses that has not going to happen to be going to happen to be going to happen.
Take my father. He was chemistrace, and I can't remember that there was a couple of the 40 years he was ever asked someone to have someone who was ever asked to him that was not afraid to it.
And this is what "John, how is it with your chemblocks?"
No, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been doing by the centuries through the centuries of the centuries of the reputation of manicalls to be follows.
Scheater that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writing, other creative people have been able to be humans to be pretty instable.
but look at the grimming death the most magnificant of the 20th century.
Many died young by by doing by their own advession.
And even those who don't have a suicide pleased place, under their gave to be considered to be suicians.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of myself was a piece of mind."
And that's a little bit to say about your life work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at the time.
We all heard it before, and we've heard it with my all accepted and spot it.
The Miny is that creativity is that creativity innecessary is that a packed to be read to the suffering and finally an artist will lead to misere.
So that's why I want to ask everybody here today, you can live with that idea living the idea of living the idea of living nois?
Do you do that OK?
Because now I think about it as a good thing about it, I think it's all a pretty good thought.
I think it was the resistance.
And even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century that this century,
We can create a lot better attention to live a lot better to live a lot better to live in.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark to that dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of my mind.
In fact, the phase that my career is in my career now.
Go too: I'm a young by a field year.
I can do maybe four decades in the decades of the decade.
Heappear to probably everything I now will be now in the outside world as the work that followed on that extraordinary is that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends up with friends of the one, so I can care probably my biggest success is my biggest success
Jemig, what an idea!
And if you think about this is what you know in the morning, you know the mornine to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love work, I love the work that I love the work.
And the question is, "Hoo?"
After long as a long time I think I can just go to the conclusion that I can just go through a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building that I can just go through a psychological protection as I can only go through a psychological protect
I have to write a safe distance of creating myself and my considered to the surface of my future in the future of response to my future published in the future of my future published to the response of the response to the response to the response to the response to the response of the resp
I was looking for the last year, I was looking for ways to do that.
I did in history, and I do a deeps and deeps me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others to help creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My for my solid called me at the old Greeks and Rombs.
And I mean, because it's a long time and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Rombs Romain and Rombs people didn't have that creativity was from themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a god-concerned spot, which was from a distincluding place to the humans and unknown for failure, to be unknown for the humans and unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these guys called these guys of creativity "demons."
On Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that words influistered him --
The Roman had a species of the same idea.
And in them was such a living of a genious mind creative spirit
The funny is that the Roman with a genius with a genius to be a particularly pient.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical god-such entities that was going to help in the walls of the poor ateller of the poorest of the poor of the poor.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house.
And when the artists was working on the work, the genius assiste.
And he gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I had the first time about the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work.
The artists was so in protection to be in protecting a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work, you don't get all the honor before you get all the honor before you get to it.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius you had helped it.
Well you got a crowd that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genius
Long time is that been considered how in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to changed
There was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual point of the universe and care above all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, from the godle-collecting world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history, there was about artists said they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a
I have to say that I find a big front of the great front of the great front of the great front of the great front of the great front of the great front of the great front.
And to let one person, one single individual to make it or she believe that he whether she is the case of the century of the century of everything that was too much to creative and the known before -- that's something that is too much to a fragile for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun into swallows you to swallow the sun
Egos are building to gigantic proportions, and there are increasingly expectations to prestations to prestensions to prested to prestensions to prestensideny.
And I think this pressure has been made a lot of artists have been made a lot of artists of artists
And if that is, and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the creative mysterile?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years we can round 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes to speed.
Probably in the audience people who have reed scientific people who have been across the idea that elfollowing elphysical creatures with what feeent poeder the work of packs.
It doesn't seem to me that I will all be in there.
And I ask it down.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought don't we have to do that though?
It fit just fit as much as all the other explanations of totally calcultive uncalculation that decided in the creative process.
And everyone who has been trying to create something -- so in fact, all of the attacks here -- you know that the creative process doesn't always rational process is not always rational street.
And that sometimes it took a paranorge.
I have been the great American closer American closer Ruth Stone of the great American animals.
She's a thick in the nine -- and you know, very life to write them.
She told me about her youth on the country, of Virginia.
Some of them when she was felt on the work, she felt in the field of attacked to the country.
It was so like there was so much like a big wave air came air came out of the air
And so close to her golfed over the country.
She felt that the ground underground her foot and knew that her at that point her at that point and she was going to be able to her life.
And she ran home, back to home in the packs, and she had to do as quickly, and they had to do it and paper.
When it came up by her honor her honor was that her only chance to write it was to write it on the way to write it.
Sometimes she was not fast enough.
Then and soil, but couldn't reaching the house.
And at the time, the poem of the poem by her, and then far, and then over the fields -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And I also also also also like -- this is the most beautiful part of the story -- that they had the close to almost miste.
And then she was in house to papire, and they shake the paper and she's seen by her.
And at that potased to do a packs.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked the poem out of the air.
She paked it back to his tail, and it back into her body, and it back into her body, as they wrote the back of her body,
And in those cases came up with the paper of well-bed well-paper, but then in the end, in the end.
When I heard that -- what is accident, I thought that is so walk up my creative process!
This is what my creative process isn't a medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouthing, which every day every day on the same time and the same time and followed with blood, sweand trans and shes through it.
But even in that daily swrace of such a experience.
You will also know it myself as well, that there is a source that there is a source that you can identify impossible to identify that you can identify impossible to identify it can identify impossible to identify it and you can identify it ourselves you can identify it can be able to identify it
What is that for the brone?
How can we use it without that we become that without we become that without the crazy.
And in a way that is good for us to do good for us to do good for us.
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life was showing the toon-imagined artists that out of all power power to get to the unconcerned on the unconcerned on the unconcerned that in him.
With the years was Tom what was rustiger.
And one day he reached in Los Angeles on the fast weight, and changed the process of the process of the process of the process of the freezing process of the freeway of the fast weight, and changed the process
And while he heard so that he heard a climbing from a melodie.
And the decided to him, like inspiration that does inspiration that is insided.
It was a nice melodid, and he wanted to follow.
But that was not going to go to it.
He didn't have a papire, no paper at the tand, no taperecorder to be a tape at the time.
The well-cooking exciting again, "I hit the melodie, "I shed the mile of eters.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he was that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked at the air and he said, "Sorry hear, don't you can see that I behind the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the sky.
"Do you really think I can write a songle to write a song?
If you really want this songle to get later, you have to take another when I have time for you.
And not, you know, anybody else fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And from that point the process of lose the process of very other.
And the work itself is the same, with the except of the dark subject of the such of the such of the such of the dark itself,
But the heavy spanning that creative process in him operating the creative process of the genius.
The genius was going to be close on the skin, and I just tell you the square just misere.
And so that there was no reason to go to the subject to go to the subject of it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration are a kind of conversation between Tom and the propertily aspect that not completely from Tom itself was going to be all of Tom itself
And that story has changed my way of working.
I had been profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddary, Biddary,
And at a point of point in despers.
You know that well, you don't want to do good works, and you think it's a terrible disast. The bad book and it will be a terrible disagree.
Not just just a lot of worse, really horrible bad --
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember his genius who were going to be able to way.
I was going to be my manuscrip, and I focused to a very very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister thope, we know all of that if this book is not just brilliant to be brilliant by me.
You can see that I have to do everything I have in the way in my thing.
I can't give you a lot of it.
And if you find that it better to be better than you have to get your things.
Snap you don't do that, you know, yes, you can't do that.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notable to be available to be available to be seen on office on off."
Tja--- Ush -- it's going to come up here
Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people to dance in the North African ancient music.
And eventually and hours, to the morning to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be extremely happened to be very extraordinary with it.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you ever ever ever ever ever seen something that in a performer.
It was like the time was stilked and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights and now celebrate everything.
And suddenly he didn't just like a human beings a human being.
In him, below him above him of glood.
A goddly free him.
And if something happened to be something called Dan people what it was began to clap and clap them and crow: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was for them.
By the way of the nice of historical fact of the things that Moren Spain-Spain-Spain-Spain-Spainting this used with it.
The spota is just by the century of the century of "Allahs in "Allah" in "Oly."
And that hear you hear today's fighting and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artist in Spain something impossible, or magical does, "Allah, oil, oil -- "Allah, oil, oil -- well, all of course, follow."
And in fact, disease of God.
And the reciipe we need.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the dance of the under of the under day to discover 11 hours in the morning to be a divest of the morning is not god-fine ladddling the next morning to the next morning to the follow.
And at that point is again, he is a little elder guy with the ancient of the maybe never come to such up to such a little bit of the highs.
Maybe there will never take anybody to calling his dance.
What do is it to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really difficult to be a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
And imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person from you.
And imagine you believe that you have a while you had a while to be able to specify to specify source.
When you are ready with it, they get given to someone else.
This is how to considered all of the way to consider.
I hang invenue that thought to be thought to be in the case of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought of the dad.
And the last months I've been working on a book that will be short to be shine a lot of time to go out to extincluding a lot to refrigeration.
The operating that illuster progress.
And if my mind to the hall, I love to the same for: I like to know the same for: I don't know it.
Do just you work.
just that you do thing you do you do then, which is also what it is.
And if you have task you to dance you to dance.
If the godd-genius that you have been decided to make in your work at a few moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of "Oly!"
And it doesn't expose that then, then, but it doesn't go up.
And then "Oly!"
I believe that of hard.
"Oh, anyway, because we can do it because we have pure human love and property,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discover the new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point, we were the biology to the digitize of the digital code and now we try to go from the digital code in the biology, with design and synthetishing and synthetishing to a new phasize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living to think of a lot of biologists have tried to understand the different levels of the levels of the levels of the levels of the way to do in different levels.
We tried different approaches to the back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years.
When we have sequenced the human genome called the analoge of the analoge world from the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask for a living to regenerate life -- whether we can create new, out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature smaller genome can be able to come to a nature of tiny.
We can throw in the order of hundred genes out of 500 or anything.
But if we look at the metabolic map, which is relative to the insistant compared to the onze.
And this is simple, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch to be very unlikely that this would be very unliving cell that this would be a living cell cell.
And we decided that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions. And so we could actually make the components to be able to make the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the ch
Stage the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we do that, "chromosome "straight "ston?
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way, but a piece of chemical inds of chemical ints material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitize of life is accelled exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slowly slowly slowly slowly of the case of slow-size.
And our last point it would take places at a moment at a time at a time.
We're more than 15 years ago,
There were some of a couple of stages for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical egars to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lengths, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it pieces of it.
So we had to do a new method for the conceiving these little pieces and corrigate of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria kill.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the fellow outcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
It started to make a little bit of a couple of chemists in the bacteria in the bacteria and the bacteria of the genetic code and make viral particles went and make viral particles and make viral particles went into the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to be cells, they came back and they came back and knew back and killed the E. coli.
I was speaking with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but all to be model to well.
They laughed more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where software can build its own hardware to build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much larger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial bac
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in cassettes to various the cassettes of various --
to go to understand what the cell is the indes of a living cell.
The design is critical crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the
When we first did this genome for the first time was the standard of the first time was the standard of one mistake a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing, we found 30 purpose than the original sequence than it was not able to start.
And the design of the design of pieces that 50 letters are going to have to overlap with all other pieces of 50 letters to build up with all other pieces of soil that we have to design so that they can design so that they can design together.
We design here unique parts in this.
Maybe you have read that we stopped waterms.
Bet, I think we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G, C, G, and T.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there is a bunch of inoxxygen for every aminoxxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, send in the words of writing words,
And in fact, we just care about it.
Some of them were involved that there were no poems.
We have this pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of creating pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters for each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters to each other, and then sets from that to 72,000.
In every stage of these pieces we had a overfluence of these pieces so that we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robusted -- that you can see that very robust -- that will be very robust -- that you can see that you see up of these pieces so that we could sequences that we could sequencing them because we could have a process of these pieces of proces
We try to reach the point of automatism.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as soon as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 based, they don't grow so easily more in E.
which is the outside of all modern tools of the molecular cular biology.
So we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homologe recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair and feet.
Here's an example.
There is an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radio radio of radio of radiation.
And that you can see in the top panel, set out of chromosome of the chromosome from each other.
12 ots oil 24 hours later, he put it back to one another, exactly as it first was first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up to be totally drought up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that can be life in space, that can be able to move forward, a new aquatickly.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the way, out there outside out.
Here's a devicrophto from the molecule that we made with these processes that we made with these processes -- actually just gistake with the right design of the bits that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did in the way.
And it is that they feel automatically add automatically
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, taken about a six seconds of six seconds.
This is the authority that we spent until out of the ones that we speak up.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code.
All right, how do we started a chromosome of the chromosome of it?
And with a virus is clearly pretty easy.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a lot of eukaryots, like us, you know, you just know the cell out of the cell and do another in, and that's what you know when it was reading.
And in the bacteria species of chromosome of the cell, but we have to do it in the cell, but we have to see that we can actually have a complete transplant of a chromosome of the cell to a chromosome of a cell to a different and can activate the act.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a microms species.
These are about so far from each other as people and mics.
We feed what extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of the extra for chromosome of the extra little extra little bit of extra little extra little extra little extra chromosome of the extra little extra little bit of the extra lot of the chromosome of the
We have been taken it with enzymes to make all the proteins, to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be very advanced with this -- and you can be able to value the new chromosome of chromosome in the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to the square to the process of what to do.
This is an essential evolutional evolutionary mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of third chromosome of them in one time that they add thousands of properties in one time that they add thousands of properties that have a second chromosome of the species.
People who are proposed to be like one to be able to be a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that restriction are called DNA that really restriction DNA to read.
It was not chromosome that was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop in it.
It was expressed and the other chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the material, and so forth of the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was stopped because we had stop.
And in very short time all the characterists of the pacterists of the species of species and changed in the new software that we put in the cell software that we in the cell.
All proteins changed the membranes changed -- when we were the genetic code -- it was exactly where it was changed.
This is a magnomic-alchemist, but we're in state by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
All right, I've been paid to be a created that this is not a creation -- this is predictables, and I paid evolution, and I paid evolution, and I pay that we might be almost a new version of Cambrical explosion of Cambrical new species that are made on this digital design in this digital design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what it needs need.
We're going to go including six-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 46; within 46.
We have to do with food with the concerned water, medicine, medicine, fuel for the six-and-half billion.
And that is really hard to do that for nine to do that for nine to nine to do that for nine to nine to nine to nine that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collecting five billion of dates five billion of them.
That's 100 miloons of offering a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or what process is to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge.
And of course, all of these carbon dioxide of the stygen in the atmosphere is going to come up in the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discoveries we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that come out of there.
We are precisely conststently by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques techniques to do technithesemethods to do so-called combination genomics."
We now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimalizing processes to make octaneously octancing and produce medicine, we can change with a little team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years, then we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years,
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for living vility, chemical or fuel production, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real design software where we work, so that you can really go on the gang and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on the computer of design in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what the computer of what we work, and you can actually design and a new kind of a new kind of a screen of the real design of what is to work, and you can actually design on the way to work on the computer of working on the way to work on the gang and can design kind of a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of design of thing that we can design of working to
We don't know about how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of it.
We fourth of fourth generation of fuels.
And the long-up to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugar to come out of sugar to more high-graduate as octan occasive species like octano.
But the only way we think we think that biology can have big influence without the food such and the available to be as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are actually starting to design cells to design that we do the first of all, and we do that first fourth of the first generation of them are 18 months and in about 18 months and within about 18 months and to have a 18 months of the first way to have to be able to read in about 188888th of a months and and and and and anessense of the
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world discoveries -- but by our world discoveries of all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles depths to cooking head temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular watering molecular watership as energy source.
We are looking at the whether we can take CO2 -- which is a very easily through pipes to fabric that CO2 to be forward to sandstone, to send this process.
So in a short era quick of time we think we are able to extend to the basic question, "What is life?"
We realize that we know -- the devices deeply the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where you can do this, where you can do it?
A major energy source to be a very important source.
But we also work on the case of these tools to be able to think about quickly.
This year there was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts of the vaccine.
I think that can change by teaching the way from tempting vaccines that can change the way to make it
Here you can see how the future can see because the evolution tree, the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We still are available to improve people.
And our goal is to assume that we make a chance to do that we make a long time to do that might be able to do that might be able to do that well.
What I want to show you as a first quickly, the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft rosoft in Microsoft rock about a year ago.
And it's a environment that you can get locally or at the distance with immense amounts of data can work.
We look at many gigabytes here to digital images and can stay up here at the time and crawl up to our wishes, and the sorts and the sorts of our wishes.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images or images.
Most of these are normal camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel and is in the 300 megapixel
It all doesn't matter because it was only what the prestations would influence to a bult system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of the data.
This is because it's graue by Dickens. Each colue is a headd-chapter.
And to prove that it is really text, and not imagination, and not imagination, we can do something like this really is a really text to be able to do something that is really text to be a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange of a book of the strange way to
I wouldn't add it.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a subject of a subject of the subject.
This is really really a pleasure and the experience of a real papers or newspaper or newspapers, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also did something that with the corner of this extractly of the Guardian.
We made a nice advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have information.
If you see the abilities of this car and you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen of hands through the screen of hands through the screen of hands through the screen of hands of the constraints of handlevel that we can do the limitations of the constraints of handlessing.
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other things like that, and other such flaw -- not needed to be more than to be more than to be more population.
Of course are amaps a for the hand is a way to do a technology like this, I will not spend here to spend a technology like this, I will not spending that we can contribuy to.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top of the NASA
Now, let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoting to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz at University at University at University at University at University at University at University at University of Washington and the University of Washingtness is at University at University
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research. A nice cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's been made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you can see this -- we can see through the images and the multi-resolution resolutions.
The space shee-crowd images here is meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images together to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are taken up. And what they are taken to see elements of stabilized images, and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is a other environments to show you another environments.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summer -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the realm of these technique power of this technique of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to do account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damam, with images from Flickr. You just just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame with the images of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame with the images of Dunk of the Notre Dame with the circircircircell.
And each of these orange chain a picture again, which was part of this model was going to be part of this model of model that was part of this model was going to be part of this orange of this orange --
And so these are all Flickr images, which are copied in this way space that are spent in this way space.
And we can do at simple way to catch a simple way to catch a simple way to catch a simple way to navige.
You know, I had never thought I would never work, I would ever work.
It's overwhelming to be so unfortune.
I believe you can see that this many types cameras -- everything from good-mirror-flexcamers, a big number of of it, considered in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange what strange images.
There are so many covered by facing faces and things like that.
And somewhere in this is a series of photographs -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chose wood-churing by the program.
If we have been piled through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with this social environment, this is now the data of everybody -- from the entire collective memory of the entire collective memory that is going to be able to each other.
All these photos are concerned with each other, and shape together a very bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth, from the whole Earth,
As a consequence on Stephen Lawler's works. The Virtual A.
And this is something that grow in complexity when they used to use it as well, and also the benefits of people who use it.
Their photographs are going to be able to see somebody else invod.
If someone would like to clip and put their names and their names and their names and their names and then my photographs, and I can use it as a access to all of the data, and I can use as a access to that space, which is used to be used to the space, which is used to be used to be able to this space model, and created with this kind of crowing, and created a kind of crowd and then a crote of cruise of cruise and then you can climbing with all of their names modone with all of these heavital modulous
And of course, it's supposed to this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who just not just from air, who just not just from air, and other accessions are engineering -- but also of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what you can do is possible to be able to the next years, all of the images that could be died by everybody on the world can copy on the world can cope to the world together to the world together to the world together?
BAA: Yeah. What this really does is discover that.
It creates to your wishhhand and hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the imaginations.
And that is defining with exciting when you think about the richching of semantic information that much of these images available images available to do a lot of these images.
When you look for the web page to imagine a search in the web, and the text on the webbpage of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination.
What if you have this image copied to all of your images?
And then the number of subjects and the amount of underling and the amount of wealth that comes out of that, in fact, it's a classic networks. It's a classical networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.
One of the intense pleasure and of evening eet eth-research is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to be forget to be forget to feeling their pasts in the wind, the touchest stones, the profits, the profitting in the wind, the profiters.
The science that Jastar-shamans still travel still in the Milky Way, or that the mythes of Inextent with meaning to the Milks, or that in the Himalage still to do jack, or that in the Himalave you really care still in the anthropology that we live in which we live in which we live in an absolute but is not a absolute to the world in which is not a smodel of the reality, but is still a very extensibility,
the consequence of a accident set apping choices that made generations.
Of course, we all parts all the same requires of the same requires children in the world.
We all make induction in the way we all make indice.
And the including including the inction of dead.
So it can't be surprise that we all of them, and dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wolden in the wolden of the Voodoo-acolites in Haiti, or the U.K. Caisut in North Kaisut in North Kenya, the Curch in the Andes-building or the Caravanai in the Sahara. This is with the Sahara. This is with the desert of the Sahara. Haitan's reished a mazissue of Quacolies in the Caia --
Everest, the godin-foot mother of the world.
They all learn all that we can be able to think different, can think of us can be able to oriend.
And if you think about it, you can just give this idea you just hope you just hope.
Samen forms the intelable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and to her just as important as the biological life web.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a doom of an etnos;
The etnosing of the foot of the case of all though, as the totally of all thoughts, collecting all the thoughcks, and inspirations and intuitions that are predicting the end of the imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etnosing is the great nalaturity of humanity.
She is the symboll of all that we can be and all of that we can be as astonishing news of animals.
like the biosphere is what the tools is the foot of the fooks, and still in much larger mate.
No biologist, would be a biologist, and that at least half of all kinds of the species of extinct of extinct is not true.
And the most optimistic scenario scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is losing to languages.
And then everybody was born here was born six-six-six languages were going on on Earth was going on on Earth was born on Earth was born on the Earth was born six-six thousand of them in the guns.
A language is more than her word whether her grammatic rules.
A language is a fashion of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that allows the soul of every unique culture the material world to reach the material world.
Every language is a century aware awing, a creation, a mind, a thought, a thought, a thought, a crow-old ecosystem to spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand of languages today's day the half of that not more child ors in children's ors.
They don't have a long time to be babies longer to be a longer too.
Effective that, unless a change, that they are dead.
Is there something like to be held by become silled by silent the last of your people, the last of your engineering your language to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the kids to be taken by the tegetting to see the children have to see the kids?
And reciiians that tergenous death every two weeks somewhere on the Earth, because every two weeks and dying with him of the old letter of an older and done and, the last letter of a old language.
Some of you say, "Wouldn't be better place to be better place when we all know the same language if we all know the same language of the same language. I said, "Super, let's take Yoruba -- let's take Yoruba
Or Kogi.You will realize you realize how it could not be able to speak your own language.
So what I want to do is to take you on a short journey by the etnos; that has to be a picture of what to actually scree in fact,
Many of us forget that when I have it about "another way of being in a different way of them, I also really mean.

And to understand of these sensal things to understand what to do is to learn something about this particularly belief about this particular particular particular Vodou, which is not a cult of black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldview, very interesting to be very interesting to

That's how it is too good to protect this too protecting themselves the older brothers.
And they are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And at this point is very important.
And if we think of inhead, and we often far Rousin and we often Rousase and of the old fabulous able: a idea that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we took stories Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth at the Earth is than us.

What does that? It means that a little child out of the Andes, which is grown up with the belief that the mountain a Apu-mind guys that will be a fundamental other human human being, and a other relationship that will have been going to be a little bit of Montana, and a other relationship than Montana, and a little bit of the mountain a little bit of the such is a little bit of mine.
Or it the living place of a mind or a lot of it is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines the contention between the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to be crazy.
And that made me another human beings of the Kuxnty of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those forests the Cuxkw and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel of the world in the north of the world and maintain the north of the world farming the world footage of the world and the Kuxness of the world that was going to be a different places of the Cuxibal spirities of the Kuxwhose are and the Cwagiving of the Kuxy's Kuxive of the Kuxace of the Constith, and who who who was made of the Cuxive that made of the Kuxive the Kuxive that made of the My of the M
These mind are important to their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
And if you start to create the idea that these cultures can be able to get different realities of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discovery. Take this plant.
It's a picture that I april you in the North west-Amazing Amazing Amazzone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive reward from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating makes so fascinating poorest is not just the farmacological potential of it, but how fascinating. It's built from two sources.
And so, there is a wooden that contains carbology and harming heart and harmaline in hearing and heart hallucinating light and hallucinating light and works.
And if you just take the plant to it like a blue that a blue crawed by your consciousness is driving your consciousness.
The plant is malthy with a cool of coffee becomes like -- Psychotria viridis.
The plant is powering powerful tryptamines, naudomines, which is to brain serotonine, which is 5-methoxyltrydimethy-methy-ptamine.
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they were that snumber of different species that substance of different species that too, which is substance of methoxyltry-ptami ptan?
That pooder you can be able to bladses, as from a member, and cut up with barokad, to be a sea of electricity. This is not a reform of electricity. This is not a distinction of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultanes, to convince -- a man who did the psychedelical aded the psychedelical ay's paddos in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect intract -- because when the effect intract the hallucy to experience. Tryptamines are not to take or, because they have been recorded by a enzyme in the human darming, because they have been measure.
They can only be orally taken with something that the monoamine of sun-under effect.
The fascinating is that the conta-carbology carbology in the limbs are to the gaps to do the tryptamine. Camine-supply itself: How can this follow in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morphological include of the morphological variant of the getting in the gribes that are larger, more than the spots of the greater than the song?
We say eufemistically "trial and -- that is like meaning left here as mean, which is going to be demask.
The Indians say, "The plants saying, "The plants talked to the s." What does the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuas -- who can identify all of the big distance of them as one kind of would be money.
And if you ask their taxonomy in map, they say, "I thought you know something of plants that you know something of plants to the plants of something of plants.
You know that you know all of the way at all.
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night of full moon in different towards in different towards of the entire side.
You don't promote to Harvard, but it's a piece of books than measures to measure than measures.
Now, the problem is that even the those of us who are actually under us that sympathic completely follows, and color, but involved them as curious, but involved to a foot in history, and the real world, mean, in the world --
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember 300 years to be remember to be technological innovations, but more than the age that we were in the age that we were in the age that we were in the mass that we were in the mass destruction of biological and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural diversity. The problem is not change.
All cultures always have been sharing a dance with new life of life possibilities.
And technology at technology is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux indians didn't stop Sioux to be Sioux and treet up their pile, just as min the Americans were to be able to be Americans and ways.
It's not changing or technology that integrity of the etnosing of the etnos; it's power.
It was dealing of the government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living followed by identify forces that are advances that forces to their appropriate opportunities that forces.
Or this is to be the tremendous engineering in the home of the Penan, a nomadical -- and the last generation that to the forest, and with the last generation in the forest, and now record to the rivers and now reduced to the river -- and prostitution to the river itself is to be the rivers, where you can see that the river help the rivers of Bords to Sout.
to fill their sooping with tree stem from the boss.
In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that had inside the disease of golden discovery of gold.
Or if we went to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genoccide, the physical excise of a people, but enoction of the enduring of a people, but it doesn't be destroyed to be not just distant to be not just distinction of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get it on the basic level.
I have a young colleague in West-China to the country from Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then I started in Lhasa was in Lhasa behind the statistics where you hear about.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people kily during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was calculated to the Panchen Lama.
And on that he was killed to the Chinese invasion.
His flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people to Nepal --
His mother was prisoning because she was ring.
He was the prison the gene of insmoky when he was two -- he was hidden under her rock, because they didn't care call, because they didn't couldn't be a crok, because they didn't couldn't be hidden under her rock, because they didn't couldn't be hidden under her rock, he was hidden the two -- he was hidden when he was hidden when he was two sisted when he was two -- he was two sisted when he was two --
The sister who stops so heldhaftight in a couple of the case camp into a couple of the things
And one day she was going to be a poorest on a poorest of Mao. For this overover, they had seven years of despersance in seven years.
The pain of Tibet can be unturned out to be about, but the concerned of the people to do do to fast your cooking on the fast of the flake.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Willls we live in a gray world of under or we want a color do we want a color do we can reach a colored world of diversity?
The great anthropologist, Mead said to her death that she peace that we directly focus that we directly a measured world image move.
We would not just see the human imagination is constently to a small, but also we would have been able to meet and forget that there are other options, and we have all been able to be other options.
We can feel like we feel in the idea that our kind of only 150,000] years on Earth is about the Earth is about the Earth is about [150.] years on Earth is about about [150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was taking our agriculture in which we across the side, when the poetry, when the potry of the shaman was taking the proza from the priests and we found a transformed by specialization and we found a decades of the sisted by a decade of the sides of the side, and we had a departnership of the seeing of the seeing of the seed of the seeing of the se
The modern industrial world is not 300 years old.
This surface is that we have not given me the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that will come to our path.
If the intelligence the world to mean of humans are asked to the means of people to responsing with 10,000 different voes.
And it's in that song that we will discover again to be discover the opportunity to be what we are see: a conscious, which is something to be able to be all the crowd to be flower. There are grandmoving all the seats of optimism.
This photograph I taken at the northern point of Baffin Island then I went to the Institute at the narwal
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inextor for the '50s, to refinite, to focus in the '50s, to put our souple of the '50s to be placed friendly in the 1950s,
The opa of Olayuk reached to go.
The family peace for his life and unnasty him all his tools and all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inter were not afraid for the col; they use it.
The gloads of their sleeing originally fish in case of caribs.
Olayuks up, not afraid for the poolnaight or the storm that wind the storm that window the storm that hit was highlight for the poolnaight or the storm that hit was not afraid for the pool.
He went outside, he was showing his bound, of sea honor skin, and he had pooped in his hand. And then the poop started woman, he had it as a limmaking it as a limb.
He brought a low-ling speeky on the sides of the wall.
And then the solid was to slaught a dog with it.
He recorded the dog and improvised a harnames and improvised a harnas.
And from the ribban he made a bad one.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood and disappearing in the ice foot of the ice foot of the ice food.
And this is going to be set around with nothing to do about it, in many ways, state symboll for the resistance of the Inin and all the inside of the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Intermine of a piece of country greater than California and Texas saming our new home. It's called our new home. It's called the Nunavut.
It's independent. They read all the soil of the ground stones.
It's a amazing example of how a native enough,
And finally, I think it's clearly obviously to these high to these hunt in the world is really, that they actually don't get far away from the world is not far away from the world to these high.
They're somebody else in home country.
They are at the beginning of the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time. And for us all the dreams of these childrens, just like the unbounced of the unbounced of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is explaining the idea that politicians never reached anything that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polic is not convincing that stories can change the world, but we believe that stories can probably the best tell us the best tell that the best tell us 35 million times a months, 35 million times a months a month in 156 million times a million-publishes and our magazine publics.
We make a fell following to the foot nos; with our audience, with our audience, to such a particular cultural places, which the task of the task of what he seeed to be able to be in a variety of anthropology will be able to be in a various of the anthropology will be able to live in a multiplate world to live in a multicultipluralistic world and pluralististic plenty of a frequirctic world
where all the way of the people, can contribute to our familiar well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about a few question that I have been a book that I have been a book in a book of the book of the book of the couple of question.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some of the represented that you might have been a couple of the case you might be able to cut up.
I want to start with the "official dogma.
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Westery, interested society.
And that official dogma is loud like follow: To be the well-of-levels on the highest level, we need to give them so much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good at the time.
And the top of the such freedom of us to do to act to act, to reach a higher waltitude without inment, to reach a higher which is to care of the things that are going to be able to access to do without insistant of the things that are going to be able to access and insell.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices love in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wealth.
This is so deeply in our society that nobody would be going to be durvily to felt in our society.
And in our life is this dogma, this dogma.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle grew.
Even about dressings.
And at the 175 changes are threats are threats are in my supermarkets of these are pull five different virgin oil and twaled different bill, and then then many bities of these bys.
And you can make a tiny tallow you to make a bunch of these 175 species for you, for the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can do itself your stereoset your stereoset of them -- loud speakers, cassettesple -- cash cash --
And that one electronics you can choose out of this attacks.
You can do six and a half million different systems, with with parts of the store.
Give to -- you have a lot of choice.
As another example -- communication.
When I was young for young long ago, you could all sorts of phones and ask Ma Bell.
You home the too. You can't bought it.
That had the benefit was never going to be the devices that never go.
And that time.
Today there are a lot of different across the way to do it.
And it is the diversity is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- with the high -- and crisis neush-bring other.
And the thing that is going to happen in the store of the store of the store of its that inside the wincle that indicates that inevent that will happen.
The consequenc: people come to the store and assuming this question.
And you know how the answer to that question is?
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of that doesn't do too much does.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact.
Gealalth care, in the United States inventing in the U.S. inmiddle of the doctor, and that you have to doctor, and that you have to doctor.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A -- or we can do B to do But, or we can do B to do But, or we can do B
A front of these and afterwards and after this.
And the one has this forward, what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doktter, what is you?"
And the doctor says, "A this for, and the first advances and they have the forevent.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you were me, what would you do you do it?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you go."
And we call that "own inbringing the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but in fact, that the heavy of decision, which is a lot of dealing of things -- the doctor -- the doctor, and someone who is freezing a sick of sick and not the best condition to take decisions. For on recipatient. And for a recipal member, and it is a lot of recivable measures much more reciled.
Good destiled up somewhere up, because the purch, because the purch, you can't buy it.
Why advertising, if we can't buy them.
Because they think that we think we are going to be able to ask our doctors to ask that other making it a case of other making a case of the other now.
Our identity yellow aspect of us existing aspect of us are now over, now as you can see on these slide.
Our identity is losing our background
We find ourselves out of -- so many of the way we just want.
Every morning, you have to think about what you have to be thinking what to person you want to be able to be thinking about what person you want to be thinking about what to person you want to be thinking what to be going to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family of marriage.
There is a time that freezes free everybody out of the automatically from that you could be smarried as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly,
The only thing was the only choice was with why, not when and what you do was going to do --
Now free everything to cut up for the way.
I teach lesson to particular intelligent students, which I was done less housing.
They are not a dommer or than in early available than in early time.
No, they have it with choices.
"Will I marrust to married or now?
Or will I wait? I wait? I first children, or a care?"
These are all the way to be set of the questions.
They go through to answer to answer and also like this means they don't get all their housing, and then they don't get good numbers and then not good cif.
And they have right. These are important life questions.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just all that technology us to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute
There is one place, which I love secret that I love secret -- where WiFi the does.
I don't know because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that we are going to be able to work from work in that we are getting up and asking it and then whether we go on and work, or not.
We can look at a football of our sone, with us -- with our sone, with us mobile and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and we can do it.
And even if they all agreed from the case of that dominate with all sorts of questions, "Am I said, "Do I responsing this phone cally?
Will I do this e-mailt response? I write this letter writing --
And even if the answer "Nee" is, we experienced the football of our son's son in a very different way.
And what we also look at the great, the small materialistic things -- life styl: life is a knew life is a kity: life is a question.
This is what the world used to looked like.
There were some of the choices, but not everything was a kitchoos;
And so the world looks like.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad to bad or bad to bad or bad
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what is good about what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
That huge choices has two effects of two effects on the human beings on the human being.
A very contradiction effect is that the more paralyzing than freezing to be freezing than free to be free in the paralyzing
and so many choices people find the distincluding to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the investment of investments in volunteer plans.
A college of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy-follow-million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
They found that for every 10 policy-policy foundations that the work-tremendous far, the particle two percent of them
As fiftimate farms, 10 percent less employees than five and less employees at five than five force. Why?
Because it in fiftiial foundly so difficult to choose that people just just extellent to the next day, and that people just go to the next day, and that copy and that on.
And from the point is coming down.
It doesn't mean that people after their pensionate after their pensionate because they have not been enough money because they didn't have enough money to eat because they have been enough money was so difficult that they worked it was working for it.
They had been going to be able to 5,000 dollars a year,
The work-to-of--double to double their own contribute to double to double to double their own contribute to double to double their own contribute to double their own contribubute to double to double their own contribute to double to double their own contributor was very distinclud.
So many choices can be collected to be collected to be collected to be collected with
And I think the world through that looks like this.
If it goes to the century -- you want to do very much like to make a very right choices, right?
You don't want to be set with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we can cut the laming of our dish and choose the laming of our and choose are with the result of the result of the result of the result would be if we had had fewer options as we had been like to be if we had fewer options and choose the first effect.
There are multiple reasons for to do for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be the choice was not perfect.
You put it in such a case of this would have been better better for that a different choice would have been better better to be better in the case of a case for that a other choice would have been better better for that a other choice would have been better better for that a different choice to be better for that a other choice would be better better for that a other choice better of the case that would have been better for that
This dreamed alternative is that you get spids of your choice.
And it says that you have seen on the follow-break that you were a good choice that you were a good choice choice that was a good choice.
And the more options, the more option, it's to have a spike of unadvance which element of element that element of the considered option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave takes all of how often we make the value of things that we are similar to the things that we come.
If you can think of many alternatives you can including many alternatives that you avoid the attraction that you encounter the engineering you away.
That makes you that are less to the alternative that you have chose to be chose with the alternative that you have chose to be cood.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers below the non: My excuses.
This is kind of the stretch of example.
This is a set of vaacation in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend again. No human being.
Don't do it? "Desp," thinks that man, "It's austy.
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is the city
I could do my car for the door for the door for the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door for the door of the door for the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door of the door for the door of the door of the door for the door of the door for the door of the door for the door door of the door of the door of door.
And he's going to be two weeks, with the idea that he crives every single day again.
subject costs are going to cost of our choice, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice choice.
The more abilities are possibilities are more attracted alternatives are there.
And those presents are like substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image store is going to be a number of points.
Life in the here, and for example, and you have to consider things that you have to considered it.
Another point is that you with every choice other choice other choices.
And all of that other has so been so attracted to the case that the cowns are being cut up to the case
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this for my square to a new breeding breeding new breed.
I turn out to almost of them almost justified to be able to do it.
It used to be one kind of spirit was just one kind of spirit was going to be able to be incredibly uncomfortable unced uncomfortable to be uncomfortable to be enough and felt enough to be enough enough to be enough enough to be enough to be able to be able to be awlet,
And after years I went to the store for a news.
I said, "Day, I want to do a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you can knob or a rit? Wilt you were a ritical wait?
Do you have a breezing with slum effect?
Do you can walk out something explaining pipes, or flink out of the pipes.
I was there of it. And after a while I said, "I want the only work, I said, "I want the only work, and I said, "I want the only work."
He didn't have any idea which was that was and so I have an hours all the possible bits of the breeding hours of the power.
And it was very honest, I left the wincell up with a extent breeding breeding breeding breeding breeding breeding breeding breeding breeding breeding breeds up with a exciting breeding breedomb.
I could have better before. And I could do better it.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? To this to myself out of myself, I wrote a book in the way to do this book
And the reason I didn't feel better with all of these choice, was that I started expecting more to expect of a good speaking more of a good speaking more of a good speaking breezing.
I started without any expectancy, because I just had one kind of spirit of a spirit of a spirit
And then it turned out that there would be different from that fast perfect.
What I was a good good -- but not perfect.
And so I was a compared to my expectations, and that asked me to count me teleur.
The more abilities people have to have more expectations they cooking about the deserves of those possibilities.
And that means people are less to be less with results, even if the good results.
Marketing chains don't know this.
Because in that case you didn't know where I'm talking about.
And in the really is going to be about that.
Everything was bad was bad at the time.

The secret of happiness -- this is to you all of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much expected.
I want to be here -- a little bit of a carbon here -- I am with a woman who is really fantastic.

And finally, when you have a bad bad bad bad breeding bad when you cooperiod of the president of the presidently, you can ask why you can intouch your inted.
The answer is in that case case case in that case case case in that case case case in that case case case in that case case in that case case case
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds available to you that turns out to fall, who is responsible to fall, who is responsible to be responsibility?

So if people decided to take people decided even if the results of those decess, they have been good counters, they have been celling their choice.
And they take themselves qualities.
In the Western society clearly about the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations.
A factor -- not the enia, but a significant factor in this explosive explosive to this explosive suiciand, is that people have so often teleuring experiencing experiences because of their high expectations.

So the nettoress, so that we care that we care about it.
As a containing together.
This is the official dogma, which is by by everybody is to where is taken for where is being touching for where is being touched by everybody to where is being touched by everybody is to be agent.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than not choose to choose and it doesn't automatically that more choice.
There is a magical ground, and I don't know. And I don't know.
But I know that we are for a long time for a long time before we are doing choices that choices are proving us well-being.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best to be able to be the best to be able to keep the best to it.
The choice of competitive in comalized countries come out of material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about earlier, where the problem is not so much choice, but just that there is too few choice, but the right thing is to do is a lot of choice.
So the paradox that I talked about this is that for the moderne, well, well-to-nitude West.
That's frustrated, and this is frustrated, you gister to installing you yesterday that expensive and installing your child sat of your money.
I say you about this past of this due choices -- they don't help -- they help now: they focus now: they focus to do it.
They make us less worth living.
And if part of what people in our society to make all of these choices to make all of these choices that people have been able to be able to do countries in the life of those people who are going to go forward.

If you get the fish crossing to create the abilities, you get less to create less tape to create less tape to create the fish case
It leads to more dish and less racing.
Everybody has a fish to a fish to do that.
This is free certainly to the fish, but certainly for the fish.
But the absence of a figure-fish to the questions to say to the miserable to say -- and devided to the wall.
Thank you for your attention.
