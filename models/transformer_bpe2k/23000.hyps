Last year, I showed these two dia's to show that the Poice cap, which the past three million years of the vast three million years of the vastant of the vast three million years with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States was free of the United States was going to be a lot of the size of the United States,
But this supposed the narratic problem because it doesn't show the disbeat the divide of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem because it doesn't shows the divide of this specific problem because it doesn't show the divide of this specific problem.
The ice skp on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, in the slucky heart of our global climate system.
It turned out in the summer and crop in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a speed-accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is diverse in red.
As you can see, it turned out to dark blue.
That's the year, that's the year, the annual ice in the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called permanenious ics, five years or older is almost like floor, is almost like floor, which is from the bodies.
In 25 years is the from this to this to this in this way.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground the Northern Icelerate and there is a very big amount of frozen frozen carbon in the meth, when the death of microbes in methane.
Some of the total amount of disance in the atmosphere, that could be double that could be double as we describe the amount of the regularly pointed the amount of the regular point of the amount of display as we describe the ambing point.
In some indepth mes, in Alaska sign of methane in the water.
Last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another one deep to another ondeep here.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is one.
A reason for that, this is that this huge "warm-Greenland from the north of Greenland from the north of warming.
This is a melectwater river.
The water volume is echer than eye to the crazy
This is the Kangerlussian river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea spiece of the sea because it is the place that the place is the place where it comes into the sea place where it comes in the sea where it comes in the sea
These stroming are flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, include on Earth.
For month reporteaching scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly, very quickly, very quickly, with name single underwaters.
The whole continent state for six feet of six feet of sea -- just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after thmassas, there are now new marks, which was a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population gets the half of his drink water of that meltiny water of that meltips.
In the Anths, is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There's more strobs.
But when they disappears disappears water.
In California was a further of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dreamed dreaming to a dramatic stying,
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen a single and never seen a face quickly.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping is completely unkeep.
If you look at the bottom of a historic context than you can see what happens.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 applied every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Kich ich at the east of the Stile of the Stille of the Stille of the Stille of the Indian subcontinent, there is a behaviors of Indian subcontinent, there is a behavioral dominate in the oceans.
The only big causes of the Earth, the only narrace, near deforest, which is the fire-deforced fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and the coal is the most biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extensive together, with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban carbon carbon carbon centrales.
But we see a circle.
These are the coal-carbon carbon became annumber of the bunch of the years, and where green alternatives were forgetting forgetting form forgetting forged the big.
There's a political fight in the globed in our country.
The urban carbon carbon and oil industire industry game of 250 million dollars to promote "scholary, which is a conversation of a conververtions
And that image did something that was thinking about something that was thinking about something that was done to me to something that was thinking about something that was done to something that was thinking about something that image was in the image of what was done to me.
And then the Churban was at home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of literally parential comodel.
You probably seen the value of the news of the news.
This is the one after one after one after the biggest way.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cottons of the cottiny sounded around the Kerstiny was this:
Video: ""Frosty the coal carbon many, is a stay chchair, challenged guy.
He is overfluence here in America, and he does it causes in America, and he causes our economy grows.
Frosty the cotman is becomes a day with the day of the day.
He is paid and catch and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia in West Virginia of froms.
The biggest mine of the country is the great bath of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship -- "Let me be, Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, Harry Rey, Harry Reously, Harry Rey, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the tom.
This is a piece of a piece of a did.
Video "Bine COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threats of our business for our business of our business for our business of our business for our business of our business
And that's why the reason that the most important goal is to give a giant to a giant to add a recline for the light and the regular policy of the truth of the truth of value of the truth of truth is about the truth of truth is about the truth is to the truth of the truth is that
Fit is, coal is not smarile is not smaril.
We think it's squatter -- and it still read -- and it still several --
So, you don't make worries about climate change
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shock cools of cools centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making pretty much of a lawys.
But that's the sound of clean coal-carbon technology.
And despite the fact that the branchoice of the most important causes of the most important causes of the Earth is changing the global beyond the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at good around this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative in the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the national security of the national security of the climate crisis.
The red wireless wireless is our dependence of fossil fuels, like the vuses and imported oile collapsoil.
But now there's a killed new solution to get out of this.
For America is 100 percent squarter of 100 percent squarter in 10 years.
A plan to get America to work on the work to work on a plan that makes us safety and the warming of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And finally, a solution that reverse enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the bottom of the way.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: I, Itâ€™s about solve energy.
One of the quickest ways to make an end to our dependence of old fuels that our planet burning to help our planet to help on the planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Oh, 2: Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking: "If you want to be saying, "If you want to be everything.
If you want to go far far far far far to contain front of the wheel."
We need to go far far far and quickly.
Thank you very much.
LHC I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am -- the ones who don't waren't waren't warenes: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever taken in the biggest scientific in the blowing of the entire scientific here.
It must have the circuits that were determines that were less than a billions of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second after the universe started 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitious, so!
This is the machine of Generator.
We took photos of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. It's the called the ATLAS, detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS, so that you can see the scale.
And at 10 septeer last year, we put the machine for the first one.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a party, for a partnership in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle that was going to go around the LHC, and with the set of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is where particles were flowing particles in the detector in the detector of the floor.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that was working on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this the biggest this the biggest or this thing, or this thing, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of business as a looked like this.
That means we made a both a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we made a cultural as a scientific impact a scien
And a week later we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golden behaviors.
These behaviors ago, 13 thousand calls of a full power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's not true. It's too small behaviors to small behavior."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be flowing that flows that flows that flows that flows that flows that flows that flows up in 271 grass,
In one of the connections between the negas in LHC, was a constructivate in LHC, was a constructivate in the LHC, was a constructive.
And then the wireless was something warme, and was inside, and was intended to that 13 thousand amplify resisted in the 13 thousand calls of circle.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets more than 20 tons of them were moving to be moved in about 30 inches.
We were civil to about 50 magnet.
We had to figure out what we did it.
We have all repared them all the time.
Now they're back on away.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We will expect him and we expect it to measure in junious, so we can go further with the true of the universe.
Now, of course, that have these unhappiness to the debate of the scientific research. It's easily to research.
I think the fact that it's hard is that it's so hard to go further than the value of things like the LHC.
I think that there are the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have to define the him of the value of his teachers of his teachers of his teachers are learning to the progress of the human beings of human beings than to take the progress of human mind than our images of human beings that there are no new world's reversy, that there are no new world, and that there are no new world, and that there are no new world's returning that there are no new world, and that there are no new new world's representable to discovered to discovering that there are not a new new new new new new new new world that there are that there are that there are not a new new new new new new new new new new new new world that there are that there are that there
Thank you.
I would like to start with you to ask you back to your children at your children played with blocks.
When you discover how to grab to grab them up, and they were painted and conscious, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Rumtely insight is a strong ded, because with understanding the world to us.
If a information of information with informed informed by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my compassion of Kalanii -- what we would ask a computer -- what if we would use a computer to ask a computer that would be a computer that moves on a plate of digital finger that moves on a plate of digital fital reaublay with information of a ply physical degreat-grapate information with with physics
and ordering ordering the way we want to do that?
And this question him that we decided that we decided to try to figure out a lot of Sifttables.
Sort cooperate is a Siftable computer in a cottable computer in a cow-cooky.
They can be moved with the hand they can put together together their movement and they can move them a screen and they would be a screen and they would have a screen contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handle blocks can be moved by grabblocks to grab into it.
And the top of the top of his Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this aid tools have a more physical difference, are consciousness of their movement and each other, and even of the way we move them are different new and nice interactions of the way we move them to discover the other thing that we move them to explore the way we move them from each other.
And I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that you can play to be played and others playfully playfully playfully playful.
This interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians near to each other, they will be put together together.
And if they get surround, they can be surround, they can be able to be a little bit of a single shead-up.
And then they movement movement and hiction.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interactive is the use of interactive, the use of all, as it dishappoised to a small as it was a liquistickly.
In this example are three Siftables emmers to go to and use them to go color in a lotor in a lotly.
And if we have over-drives, we went back a little bit back.
There are some of the crash education for education, which is play-play-played game with language, and logics that we want to give people fast the possibility to see things quickly, and the result of the result of immediately disappower.
So here I -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci squaring programmate.
So here we show a game that a crossing is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the randombs on every Sifttable, and send words in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is very rescue, and a new series of letters with a bunch of a bunch of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the United them to the Media video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need to have instructions of this application is that people need instructions of this apply is that people needed instructions of this apply is that people needed instructions of this apply interesting things of this apply interesting things that people needed instructions of this apply
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people to testing the tests.
And that's our youngest ber bunch of tester, right?
And it turns out that he was living the Siftttles.
For him these were only blocks.
Here is an interactive paintingly paint.
We wanted to do a platform for learning a platform for language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demo.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the table with that character of the table with that character of the table of the table.
Here he leave the sun coming out of the sun coming out of the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene rill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of Mer
Video: The orange tractor.
Good mind of God mind --
And by Sifttles, Sifttables and the near places to each other, he can respond to each other, and the nextables with each other, Wdeak --
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Helello!
DM: It's a story with an open end of an open end of an open end of an open end of an open end.
and he decided to destroke.
Video: The cat flies fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music and live music that we developed recent a sound producing of a sound as the lead, bass and prem.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use which you want.
These sound in the lege Sifttables can be injected so that you can determined the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern Sifttables in the pattern Sifttables can be injected.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the apparing of a living in a livable of a life-control effects like reverb and filter.
They are provided to a sound and attacked by the office.
And then the general effects like and volume that are being such and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's see here.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I add a little battacks.
Video: And now I copy the movie of the press, so I can affect live the effect live the effect live the effect lives.
Video: DM: I can spend it by the offices by the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the movie of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can refrigeration while it playt.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise everything to be the longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And finally the dimmessage from the volume of the volume Siftleftleft.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is to make a new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and bodies working on the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we develop with some opportunities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attack is that this is just a new generation of aid medical mediumbers for the interacting with digital media that we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at them to talk to you with all of you to all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long time I have written from writing and I don't think that that will change that will change
And yet there is something unmostly in my life and careering in my life and career, which I had to re-in-in-foot in my work on my work on the work of my work on my work on the bottom.
And the began with a book I wrote unfree, a memoire: "E, Biddary, that very very much in contradiction to my first work on the whole world was going to my first work on and an international existercise exister cellers.
And the consequence is that people are now to me and always told me as if I do I have touched to me.
And I think -- -- the member.
People come to me and ask to me and ask ask you that you can't evenar?
Don't you do not afraid you will keep your whole life will be writing to be published a book that people will write for warm.
Don't you get to this?"
First of the assumption --
Of course, that would be very very -- I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenaged -- when I was a teenager,
People said, "Don't you get success, you will never get succes?
Don't you can go to the point that you will go on it to be going to go on it.
Don't you imagine that you live on this work that there is a lot of fals' worky that there is something from your bittery with your grid of your game with your gmond bittery bittery bit?"
Something in that streting.
In the short comes my answer to that questions on this no, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called enough.
All of the time of all,
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid of other things afraid --
For example, for example, and other entire things.
But what is writing myself is writing myself the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it the logical that somebody is eight to be working for the work that they were to their mentional on Earth for their mental to their mention?
What is so particularly to create processes that we make us to make the effects of the immediately of the mind of the mind of the mind of others don't happen.
Take my dad. He was cheists of my dad and I can't remember that there in the 40 years that he was asked to him that he was asked to him that was asked to him that was felt for him or he was not afraid to him that was front of the 40 years that he was was
And that is how to say, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, so there was no concerned about it.
To be fair to be fair reputs of the century hold through the centuries have been chemisting piece of manically, to be chemistried from from the century alcoholists to be depressive alcoholists of manically,
Scheator writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writer, other creative people have been able to be the reputation mental instable.
And then look at the grim death the most magnife of the 20th magnificant of the 20th century.
Many died young boy, often by own stiers, often by own own stiers.
And even those who don't have a suicide nature suicide to be suicide their gave to be suicide their gave suicide of their suicide ord to be suicide as they have been suicians to be suicide for suicide ord to be suicians who are not
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of myself."
And that's a little bit about what to say about your life-life-work.
But of this kind of inforces we don't look at it.
We all have heard the first of all, and they have heard it with my all accepted and accept it.
The Sorera is that creativity is that creativity insuffering is that a poor, and that a artist-eventually will lead to the inventually lead to the wall.
So why do I want to ask everyone here today I ask everyone here today that idea of life?
Do you do that OK?
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I think about it, I think about it was not a little little mind.
I think the reastonish.
And even even more dangerous thing.
I wouldn't like this century this century also so on.
We can create creative minds a lot better than to live a lot better to live a lot better to live.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to those dark in the dark of the thought of the thought of the day.
In fact, the phase where my career.
Go tun: I'm still young, amper teaching years.
I can do maybe four decades in the four decades.
And the Hoom probably will be everything that is going to be seen by the outside world as the work that followed on that extraordinary book.
We are here with friends up here with friends on the galaxious thing is probably my biggest success is my biggest success in me.
Jemig, what a idea!
And if you think about this is your mind knows in the morning, you know, it's in the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to the work that I love with the work I love the work I love to the work I love to the work I love to the work that I love the work I love the work I love to the work I love to the work I love to the work I love to the work I love to the work I like this.
The question is, "Hoo?"
After a long time I think I have been to the conclusion that I can only go through with write when I can just go through a psychological protection in the process involved in the process involved in the process of the process of conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion of as I think I can only do a long time.
I have to see the write a safe distance between mitself and my concern between mictive and my convert to the reactions on my future publications.
I had been looking at ways to ways to do that.
I am in history in history and have me deeps in other civilizations to see or others or others to see or others or others have found a better way to help creative people to do to the emotional complications of creative process.
My search to, I had to get me to the old Greek and Romend.
And then you know, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Rombics and Rombands people didn't believe that creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity was a goddline that was a retable place to human beings came to the human beings were living failure, to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these these calls called these creativity of creativity "demonen."
Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that he represented him words of influistence.
The Romenon had a speciety of idea.
In them is called them a both of a living creative mind creative mind a genion.
The funny is that the Roman with a genius with a genius is not a pience of a genius to be a particularly piently person.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical goddal and that was hidable to the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs of the house of the household.
And if the artistic was working on the genius assistance.
And he gave he gave the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier about earlier in the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be working in his work
The artists became so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was not going to be there.
Everybody knew that a invisible genius you had helped a genius
Do you get to work on your work -- you know, that not only is you just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Lange time is that the West, how in the West, creativity was considered to be considered to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed
And there was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, intentially from the godal of the goddal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual --
And for the first time in history in history was there about artists said that they were a genius and they had a genion.
I should say that I think I think that a big front of a big front of a big front of honest.
To one person one person, one single individual that he or she is the vehicle of the century of the century of everything about the century of everything that godlaborate -- that's a lot of responsibility of responsible human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun inside the sun inside the sun of swell.
Egos are read to gigantic proportions and there are incredible high expectations to performances to performances to performance
And I think this drug has made a lot of artists have been making a lot of artists of artists
And if that's so is, and I think is the question is, "What is?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a parent to a older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human and creative mysterious mysterious people?
Maybe not a maybe not.
We can not be rational humanism rational humanism not unfer in a 18 minutes to do in a 18 minutes.
Probably sat the audience of people who are require the scientific doubt of the idea that elfighting with some fact that fight-like to inspiring the work of artists of artists to inspiring highlight of the pooroorest in the audience.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in there.
And yet, I ask it down.
Why don't don't don't do that?
Why would we do that couldn't we have that thought about that?
It felt as much as much as all the other explanations of total calcultivity that are include in the creative process.
Everyone who are trying to create something -- so in fact -- so in fact that the creative process here -- you know, the creative process doesn't always straight to be rational process issue --
And that sometimes the body, it feeling.
I have recently defarmers the great American closer to the great.
And she is a thick in the nine. Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the plattempt of Virginia.
Some of the field, if she was felt on the bottom, she heard a poeming on the country.
And it was so she said though there was a big wave air.
And so so that I would have close than the country to her it.
And she felt that the ground under her feet began to do and that her at that point, and to do that her at that point, and to her life.
And she ran to home, back home, and she had to do as possible and she had to do as possible and they had to do it as possible and paper to do it.
When the close by her hate was that her only came up with her only waves her only chance to write it on the way to write it.
Sometimes she was not quickly.
Then she racing and ran but circle the house.
And at such moments the poems, the poems, and then the fields, looking for the fields, in her words -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another poem --
And then you know, there were even -- this I think -- this is the most of the story -- that they get the close of the story -- they almost miste.
And then she was searching for paper and paper and paper the paper and the paper by her hip and shape,
Just at that point, she had a potle-packs.
And with her other hand, so she told me she told me she was told the close of the air.
She took the close to his tail and it back back into her bodied the back in her bodied the bodied of the bodied
And in those cases, the close that came in the paper in the paper in the paper of paper was supported hollowed gord throw.
And then I think -- what I thought -- what is -- what is happiness to my creative process of creative process of my creative process of creative process of my creative process of my creative process --
So my creative process isn't working on the mem! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who every day on the same time on the same time on the same time and sweat, and trans and trans and trans on it.
But even in that daily swrinely swrind a experience of a experience.
You will also be knowledge, that feeling that there are creative ideas in your hidden release you can identify impossible to identify impossible to identify the way you can identify it.
What is that for brone?
How can we use it without that we become that without that we become that without that we get it without that we become the us?
And in a way that issue for us.
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A couple of years ago, I was him for a magazine.
We had this about this.
Tom is actually a lot of his life is a lot of his life to the shows of the contemporary artistic artists that are going to be able to get on the unconversable creative impulses in him that allow up in him to pulses in him that allow up to him.
And with the ''d became a little bit more restigerer.
And one day he required in Los Angeles on the fast wear, and changed the process of the race process of the radical revenue.
While he was so hold he heard a fragment, he heard a celodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that does does a father, indepensive birth, cattacking.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to dished the vasths.
But that doesn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no pt, no paper on the task of a challenge of the paper at the time.
The well-exciting exciting is from him: "I got the melodies of the celodies, and then keep it in the century backwards.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He was not in panic, but he was not in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, you cannot see that I sat the point, you cannot be the stuff?"
"Do you really think I can write a song, now,
And if you really want this songle to come later you have to reflect when I have your time for you.
Don't not, you know, somebody else fall.
Ga neighborhood at Leonard Cohene." And from that point the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the return of the neighbor." And then the time the process of the reverse of the proc
The work is the work itself, with the dark of the dark support of the bottom.
But the heavy exciting that the creative process in him represented the genius of the genia.
The gene was going to close him on the skin and liver, but it just catch a gently.
Tom realized that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the kind of conversation between Tom and the owner aspect that not completely of Tom himself was a birth of Tom himself was a mazing of Tom hi
And that story has changed my way of working on the way of working on the story.
I had been proficting from it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddary, Beminning.
And at a point of point in despase.
You know that what you want to work but not to do you don't want to be a terrible disappears becomes a terrible disappear.
Not just just bad --
I wanted to do the whole project all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are who who are genius who are genius and I also decided to way.
I wended from my manuscrips and focused cripped me to a fun corner of the room.
And I said hardopinion, "Lister thing, we know that if this book is not only brilliant is not only because of me.
You can see that I have everything I got everything I got in what I got in what I got in what I got in the way in what I got in it.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better own, you have to do your things.
Do you don't know that, you know, your ammer thank you.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notate, and maybe be removed that is just a lot of the office."
Tja--- Usongs it here on here.
Eeut, Eeums came in the North African desert African desers of people to thank you in monthy to dance in monthy music.
Ors and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always wonderful, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes sometimes happened to be something called something extraordinary happened.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, what I mean, you have ever seen with a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now I have seen together.
And suddenly he was not going to be a human beings a human beings a human beings.
In him, under him above him of him
A goddly freretiny him.
If something did happened to be something called the Dan people what it was started to clapping them and clapping them and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because that was for them.
And by the way, a fun of historic fact: When the Moren Zouth Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish they brought this one.
The executive is the century of the century of "Allah," Allah," Allah," in "Oly."
And that you have today the day still today at the day and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spaintor in something impossible or magically, "Allah, oat Allah, oat Allah, oat Allah, great, b."
Actually, a God.
Precions what we need.
Lastig is the dance is that the dance of the dance of the decade that he discovered on dinary ladying 11 hours in the morning.
And at that point, he is a little elder man with debath with the bad that will never come to such highlight in the craft.
Maybe there will be a God never took a while in the dance.
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sell a creative mind to a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be painful it doesn't have to be painful to be painful.
Imagine that you don't go from extending that the most imuses of your person from yourself come out of your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have a while, you have a while to specific bron.
When you do it with it.
And it was bottom, both of everything.
I hold up in the average of the dad that are thought of the day.
The last months I've been working on a book that will be short to a book that will be share. And the book where a lot of too long as a long time is challenged is challenged to a book in a lot of the last months that will be share.
The operating that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the dom of the doctor, I keep the same for: Don't do it.
Do just do you work.
just as you do thing, what it is.
If you are too dance you will dance your job is going to dance your job is going to dance your job is going to dance your job is going to dance your job is going to dance your job is going to dance.
If the goddal genius is that you are decide to make a source in your work at at some point in your work at some point, "Oly!"
For not, thank you very much.
And then, "Oly!"
And that believe I believe that I believe --
"Oh, well, how you ook, because we have pure human love and propertly, because we keep human love and propertly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Or.
You know, I've had been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean,
We actually started from a new point, we were the biology to the digitizing of digitizing that digital code to a new phase in the biology to a new phase in the biology of the biology of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think of a lot of biologists have tried to understand the different levels in different levels of the phenomains.
We tried different approach to left the different approach to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize in the digitize
When we have the human genome of the human genome of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world from the computer.
Now, now we try to ask life -- we can create life to create new life in this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can be a kind of a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a little smaller genome of genome to be a genome
We can go out in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or soon, which are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simple, which is simple,
Gelore me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check a piece of the genes that would be a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell that would be able to do a living cell cell cell that would be able to be a living cell cell cell cell cell we can do
And we decided that the only rout, the only rout, to synthesization this chromosome of synthesize that we could deal the components to the one of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking asking for the questions like that, "Can we have a chromosome synthesesis?
Staat the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome chromosome "way?
A chromosome is a chromosome is but a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitizing life is accelerate on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code of slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-ade-write crows,
And our last point, it would put on this point, on a exponential curve.
We have started here more than 15 years ago.
There were some stages for a bunch of stage for a bio-ethical ethical acction to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult --
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA 30 to 50 letters in length of DNA is a degenerative process, so the longer you make the longer you make it piece of the packs.
So we had to make a new method for the building of these little pieces and the correct of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of these little pieces of the parents of these little pieces and the correct of all the awrongly of these little pieces of
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, the pieces, the foutcorrection
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a piece of chemical chemical stune chemical code in the bacteria genetic code and virtually go through the genetic particles are going to make a virale particles are going to make a virale particles and virtually started making the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to losed when losing money from the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was unfellow in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but they said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model --
They laughing more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware are in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in cassettes so we could various --
to understand what the thing that are the realm of a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell to understand what the real.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than to the digital information in the computer than to be very accurae.
When we first first this is this genome for the first time was the standard-exactly one mistakes a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 folds. If we had the original sequence, it was not going to start on the return on the region.
Actually, the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters that are going to be away from 50 letters to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build single the sub-simpitted sub-simply sub-of-size that they can go together.
We design here unique parts in this room.
Maybe you have read watermarks.
Beasy thinking, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, G, C, G, and T.
Trios of those cos code for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a bunch of them is a bunch of every aminoxygen of every aminoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though.
And in fact, we just just a lot of signs --
Some of them were teleggated that there were no pushed that there were no pushed to be purposed to be purpose that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are anzymes they repairs and put together.
And we started to make pieces of pieces of these pieces of five to 7,000 letters were going to be able to 7,000 letters in each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters of the things that are at 7,000.
In every city diverse we got a diverse of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process that will create a process that will be very robuust -- that will be very robust --
We try to do the point of automatishing the point of automaticization.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as soon as we come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow so much more in E.
That explains the most of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms in other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-recombined repairs, which is used by the biology to repairs, that can add DNA can add DNA can add DNA can add together.
Here is an example of that.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that has three million radio diodurans that three million radiation of radiation.
And that you can see that in the top panel, som sopm just sophistic, just just out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he took it down into each other, exactly as it was first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dried up to be drood.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacuum of a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum
I know absolutely sure that there can be living in space, that can move that can move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of it,
Here is a microph of the molecule that we made with these processes that we made with these processes -- actually actually with these processes with the right designs that we did in the right designs that we did them.
And it is that they address it to add automatically contained it to do it.
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope
These are photos, genomes on a six seconds.
This is the publication that we explain ungs.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans, with a disheppearing of a structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages in the genetic code only to pressure.
Good, how do we start, a chromosom? How do we go to it? How do we do it?
And with a virus is the clearly easily.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give your eukaryots, like you whose you just whose the cell and do a different in and does another in, and that's what you know when it was reading when it close.
And in the bacteria is the chromosome of the chromosome of the cle, but we have shown on the cell, but we have a full transplant of a chromosome of a chromosome from a cell transplant to another onother, and can activate the bacteria.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micromosome species.
These are about as far from each other.
We added some of what we could take to this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome.
We have the responding with anzymes to make all the eggs to make all the eggged to make all the eggs.
It was free sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the new chromosome in the cell mosome in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell --
We even thought that he would come to sover the way that it would come out of the process of what we thought about what to do is going to be further out of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discover all kinds of these kinds of chromosome of chromosome of a thousands of somewhere from day-thousands of self-apply required otape in one time of the species.
People that evolution evolved as if there is one changes that they have a lot of biology to be biology.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes are called DNA that are actually going to make DNA
The chromosome that was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stopped --
It became expressed and the other chromosome of chromosome as strange of material, and so that we had the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of one species, and changed the one species, and changed he completely in the new software that we in the cell we put in the cell software that we stopped in the cell of the cell of one species,
All the eggged membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code was changed the genetic where it was changed.
This is a magine alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamental to change fundamental to change fundamental point.
Good, I've been paid to that this is not a creation that this is not a report -- this is prepared in 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we may be be able to be a new version of the Cambric explosion of the Camban explosion of new species of moving in this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what you need is.
We're going to go in ses-and-half billion people, for nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 1946; within 40 years, that there will be four there.
We have distincluding the number of clean water, medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine,
And that is hard to do that for negine to do that for negine
We use five billion tons of collapsed coals, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of vates, per day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than to replace, or what it is going to be a huge challenged to be a huge challenge.
Then there is all those carbon dioxide of the stine that comes in the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discoveries we have now a database of about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had only a dozen of different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We are precisely constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques techniques of synthesemethods to do so-called combined "combined combined to do such a genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes or tries to optimate processes to optimate or to produce or medicines or medicine, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years, then we can do more mole-science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for life-life-fatbirth-production production, vaccinproduction production, vaccinproduction and so on.
This is a screen maple of what real designer design, and this is where we work on the gang and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on computer in computer in computer
We don't know how it will look at how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like this.
We fourselves now fourth generation of fuels.
Our glos you have seen fluence to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuels that will come out of sugar, to more higher fuels of sugar, or different fuels of butanoli.
But the only way we think that can think that biology can have a big influence in the foodness pricers, and the available is when we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are cellells to design that do in that way we think we think we think that the first fourth generation of the first of all, and we think we have the first fourth generation in about 18 months of months and within about 18 months of the first way we think that we are about about about 18 months in about 18 months and within about 18 months of the
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries of discoveries are all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, about 2.5 miles in cokens.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy hydrogen sources as energy sources.
We are looking at if we look at CO2 can we take CO2 and we can be able to be moved to factory fabrun, where that CO2 is coming back to the fuel to fuell fuel to the fuel to the process of the fuels of the fuel of the global to send this process.
So in a short time to be able to think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We have realize you know -- you know, the deaths are the petrochemical industry to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- where then you can do this at TED
A important energy source of energy source of energy source of a major source of energy source of energy source of a major source of an important energy source.
But we work now now now now to use these tools to think of these toolle servaccines of vaccines in the way to think of the targetable to think about this.
This year, there was the flu -- we always walk the flu, we always have a little bit more the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by from textomowned vaccines
So here you see how the future can see what the future is going to change the evolution is going to change the evolution with synthetic bacteria, archeukaryota.
We are more removing from humans.
Our goal is certainly to imagine that we make a chance to survive to do that which is a chance to do that which is a long enough to do that which is a long enough to do that we make a long enough to do that we make a chance to do that what we make a chance is to do that what we can do is a chance to do that which is a chance to
What I want to show you as a little bit like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a birth of which you can local or on the distance of visual data can work with immense of visual data can work.
We are looking at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can stay here on the way to keep up here in and challenge to our wish and the sorters to our wish and the sorters.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of Congress, and is reaching the 300 megapixel of the Library of the Library of the Librance of Congress,
It all makes nothing because it would be because it would be able to affect on a third of the system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, an example data.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Elack column.
To evidence that it is really text, and not a picture, we can do something something that is really text, to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of a strange of reading a book of reading a book of reading.
I wouldn't be the food.
This is a realistic example of the Guardian. This is an example.
Every big image the beginning of a bottom.
This is really a pleasure and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper of media is actually a scale medium is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We made a nice, we made a higher resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas we can really make it constraints that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen of the screen of the screen.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more pop-ups and other third flawwwol -- not needed more of the flawwwwo.
Of course, a lot of agrands are a for the technology of technology as this one technology as this one of a technology like this, I will not spend a lot of time we can contribute in a lot of the contribute of a lot of contribute in a lot of bitself,
These are all the roads in the United States --
Over the top of a picture of the NASA
So let's look at something different.
This is now live on the Web; you can see it.
This project is called Photosynth, which two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision research by Noah Snavely, promoting to the University of Washington, of Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this -- we see through the images are photos and the multi-resolution resolution resolution of the images and the multi-resolution resolution to it.
The space shacking of the images has this mean is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have been cooperiod of the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomomes -- where they are genomommic diashood of the past images, and all these things are space -- and all these are space.
I don't know if there is a lot of time or there is another environment.
There are a lot of space that are more space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data.
We had to keep requires with the advocates, and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame with the pictures of Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And each of these orange chgels a picture again, a picture of this model of model that turned out to be part of this model of this model of model of this model of this model of model that was part of this model of model of this model of model of this orange chestation.
And so these are all Flickr images that are copping in this way of space in this way of space.
And we can do it at simple education.
You know, I would have never thought that I would have ever worked at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so defined to be so determine.
I believe that you can see that this fielth cameras are cameras are cameras to mirrors of them together, a great number of of of it, a lot of of it,
And I'll try to find some strange some strange images
There are so much more of addition and so much of the face and so on.
And somewhere in this is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chured by the program.
If we push the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entire collective memory of the face, the Earth is looked at each other.
All these photos are become together and shapes together a little bigger than the sonce of the parts.
You have a model that from the entire Earth is from the entire Earth.
As this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the work of the work of the Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it when they use it -- and also the prepared of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being provided to be able to see somebody else in the way that somebody else in the world.
If someone all these himself would like to climb and their names and their names are going to be able to get their names with all those data, and that can I use as a access of all those data, and that can I use as a access of the space, which is uses of every photos, creating a kind of cross-modle model, and created social experience.
And of course, is the be-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which is not only from the lucks, satellite images and other across is entirely from the collective photos, but also of the collective memory.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible on a day, in the next years, all the images that are dealing by everyone in the next years, all the images that can cople copy?
BA: Yes.
It creates to your wish your wish hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on basis of the data in the images.
And that is exciting exciting when you think about the richchchallenged of semantic information that much of these images are described in this images of these images are going to be away of these images that are dedicated in the wealth of semantic information that is deploying.
When you look for image to imagine a searching in a searching and the text, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image representation.
What if now is that copping is copied to all your images?
Then the number of underling-summers and the amount of wealth rich that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of this is a classic network-network-network-network-scale network-lingdom-summer-lingd-ling-lingd-linge semantic connections are the classic network-ling-lingd-lingd-ling semantic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Geffort. Gefeffort.
One of the intense pleasure of traveling and of eattached the possibility to live between them is the possibility to live between those who are not forget in the wind, which are more listening in the wind, the touch of the wind, the profited stone in the profitting bitters.

Of course, we all share the same approach to the same thing that we are born. Brenrengors. Brengles. Brenrence children in the world.
We all make all inforces of inference.
And with the inctive disheading through the box of death.
So it can't be surprising that we all singing, dancing that we all have sings, and art it.
But interesting is the unique of the song, and the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the song-culture.
Or now that is about the Penan in the wish of Borneo, or the Voodomic acolites in Haiti, or the Caisut-de-de-wood response in North Kenya, the Caraisuant in the Andesss-built in the heart of the Sahara. This is the man I require with the desert of the desert -- or a majacking a months of Quacross the Comomics of Kathmagnangan of Kangan ath,

They all teach us that we can be different, we can think of us that we can orient.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.

And then, the most apocalyptic scenario comes not even in the neighborhoods of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of this is pays.

This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive clear, from the repertoire of the shaman.

I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who did the psycheal adelic times, by his discovery of paddo's in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.

I have a young colleague in 9,000 miles on the country of Chength China to Lhasa.
And then I got in Lhasa -- I started in Lhasa behind the statistics that you hear about
6,000 Heily monuments destroke, 1.2 million people killed the Cultural Revolution.

And on the basis of that he was killed when the Chinese invasion.

And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Wills we live in a gray world of a tance world or we want a colorful world of diversity or a colorful world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that she strange that we direct a general image image picture of the amorf worldview image image image image picture.
We would not only see the human image of the human imagination to a small models to a small model, but we would have been existed and forget that there are other options are existence.
We can feel feeling us in the idea that our kind of pas about [150,000] years, on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution that we have been given to the agriculture in the cult of the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the proza by the proza specialization of the priesters and we found a rescue specialization by specialization of the priest of the shaman was only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history that we will not the idea that we have all the the question that we will have all the the question that we will come out the next millennia on our path.
If the intelliable cultures of the world to be more of humans are asked to people, they answers with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover the opportunity to be what we are going to be what we are is: a full species that that allows everything to be flowers to be blood and all the gardens of optimism.
This picture I have this picture on the northern point of Baffin Island, when I went to Indeed,
This guy, Olay: Mink, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inexcited. In the 1950s, to put our souple of the 1950s, to fightless, in the nder-ting-tours of the 1950s,
The opa of Olayer reflect to go to go.
The family family strange for his life and member, him him all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Interinal were to the college of the college of it.
The light beings of their key became original in fish in caribs.
Olayer was not far for the Poleft or the storm that was going to the storm that was touching of the storm that was touching of the storm that was going to be front of the poolnaked for the poolnaked for the pool.
He went out to outside, his breeding skin, of sea hunthinking of the poep began to be freezing, and he started freezing, he started a limmet.
He brought a low-to-both speeky on the sides of the mes.
When the solid, he was slaught a dog of them.
He unfelt the dog and improvise a harnaks.
From the ribbbbbbbbits he made a bad
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood and disappearing on the ice flake, including pes.
And with nothing about nothing to do about nothing in many ways, and this is symbol for the resister of the Interin and all the inside of the world.
In april 1999 the Canadian government the Interinin the entire converted from a piece of country larger than California and Texas sams together than California.
It's independent region. They remember all the ground.
It's a bluffing example of how a native example of how a native to her people can bitate enough to her people can bitch a native example of how a nation-dozen enough of nationship does.
And finally, I think it's clear to the most of the world's living to this high to these home of the world is require that they don't get far away from the world --
They are somebody else homics.
They are going to be from the human imagination, which is going to go to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, will be the dreams of these children, just like the unfluence, part of a hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extending the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convinced but we believe that stories are going to tell the world, that we probably the best storytellers in the world. Our website is 35 million times a month, we have in 156 million times in 156 million times a month-sharing public.
We make a fell to the fattack-fell to the front of our public, with our public, to such a such besides of the most of the most important barely by what he sees so hopefully ongone every opening the most important baring of anthropology will be able to be requent in a way to live in a way to live in a multiculate in a multiculal and pluralistic world
which all the wisdom of all the several can contribute to us well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question that I have a book that I have a book in a book of the book of the question that I have well-a-a-head of the question that I have well-away that I have well-away that I have a book of the question that I have a book on and I have a book of the question
Maybe you can see paralls with information of other sources.
And even though I try to explain some sense, I also tried to you may be a little little bit of the well.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the wester, invent society.
And that official dogma is awma as a follow-sing: Om the well-level of our civil free-level soon, we need to give them as much as possible to be the individual freedom of the freedom of the most possible level.
Freedom is a big cheat, a big cheat-challenged part of the human exist.
And the such dies, frequire us to action to treat a higher which is to reach a higher which is to reach a higher which is to reach a lot of third of these.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicy-possibility.
More choices love in that people have more freedom of freedom
And more freedom means automatically means more well.
This is so deep in our society that would be a deep divice.
And in our life is this dogma-de-fish.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
In fact, at 175 changes are threats of these are threats in my supermarket of these are virgin the supermarket virin the supermarket as a grid of a balyze.
And that you can make a task of your own threats of your own threats of these 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can put your stareosed your stareosed -- loud speakers, cassettesple of the radio, radio, surprise of the regular, radio, a lot of dio, a look at the point.
And if you can see one electronicawinkle clip out of this display.
You can assumpt and a half million different systems, with parts of those stores from that wine.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
At another example -- communication.
When I was young hundred of you could do all phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You home the state. You don't bought it.
That was the way that it had never been the advantage that it never piece of it.
That time is forces.
Tegen's word in a lot of different apply applied of different apply.
And in order to cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- that with the nush-player and crative fun break break break of the fun break fun break of the game of the game of the major --
And the couple of you haven't seen this model but you can be sure of his that happens.
The sequenc: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question aw?
No,
It's not possible a mobile of buy that doesn't do much too much does not do much too much too much of it.
And in aspects of life that are more importantly, than the attacked that is a lot of choices are an explosive choices a fact.
Gealth care -- it's not in the United States is not the doctors that you go to the doctors and that you have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do A, or we can do Bay or we can do Bay or we can do But,
And a front of this and after this.
BBy has this forward and ass?"
And you say, "Dokpter, what does you find out of what do you find in the point.
And the doctor says, "A has this forward and Bion, and the But, and the endly.
What do you want to do is to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was going to do what would you do you do than do that?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you.
And we call that "own inbright of the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide of company of destate of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the best condition to take decision to take decision to take the best condition to take a lot of recipate of recipal gets are much more reciled.
Good destate, that nerrine, because the goal group, you can't buy them.
Why reclable, if we can't buy do they cannot buy to buy
Because they think that we think we think that we are the next morning, to ask our doctor to ask that other market away to ask that other market away to ask that other mark is going to be the next morning.
Our identy, yet a price, right? A free of us of our exist, is now overcome on this dia.
Our identity is is loss of our background.
We like to find ourselves -- so we often want to do it.
Everybody morning, you have to be able to think what you want to be a little bit of your want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's a time that frererequickly everybody else there is automatically from that you possible to children as possible and then as possible to children began to children began to children began.
The only reality was choice with who, not when and what you did was what you did.
Now you know, it's going to be free for the opportunity to the up.
I left to particularly intelligent students, which I was going to be less housing with less housing on than the housing.
They are not a little him or lucer than in the earlier than in the earlier than in the earlier time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Are I saying, whether not?
Or will I wait? Let me first kids, or a career or a career resection?
These are everything to ask questions.
They go through the single they have an answer, as this means that they don't get their homework and then couldn't get a good couple of the number stories.
And they have the same living questions of living questions.
And then we come to work. Carl game just that technology us is going to be able to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love measure, where Wii the does.
I don't think that because I want to keep the place for myself.
But good, who are choice, who are choices in that we are going to be able to ask us on time, or we go to him or not.
We can look at a football of our son of our son on our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and the balities on the other hand, and the such our laptop on sot.
And even if they all all from the time they all come from the aware of that represented with all sorts of all sorts of this question: "Am I assum?
Are I responding response to this letter --
And even if the answer is "Nae" is, we experience the football of our son on a very different way.
Where we look at the big, the small, the small, materialistic business, living is a choose of choos;
And this is the world used to see the world exactly looked like.
There were choices, but not everything was a choices, but not everything was a choose of choos;
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about what is good about what is going on.
And that huge choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings.
A very contradiction is that the earlier is that the earlier than free is that the earlier.
And with so many choices are people like to make the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic, a very dramatic, a research to investment in volunteer planns.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data, a great policy of Vanguard, a great policy with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vehicles of fashion about 2,000 vehicles.
They found that for every times, that for every times, that for every times, that took the work-touched detached the partnership of two percent of the touch of the touch of display disheps.
And in fifxce of five percent of the founds. Whyet are less employees than five and the rom?
Because the farming is foundations so hard to choose that people just exactly resembling the choice to the next day, and that that I think that red, and so on.
And of the destate comes from the globe.
That doesn't mean that that people don't have the people don't have a dry bread because they don't have have been assed because they don't have enough money they have been such as hard to have a lot of lower as they have been a lot of display to have a lot of display to have a lot of the works.
And they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose,
The working was very couple to double their own contribute to double.
So so many choices can be a lot of choices can work on the bottom.
And I think the world looks like that.
If it goes to the century to the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be upset, you know, the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
And that's the first effect. The second thing is that we have the block of our dish laming the laming of our and choose are less and choose are less of the result than the case would be when we had fewer options have had been options of options.
And there are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example of tasy tune to look at the point.
You ask you in such a case that would have been better than a different choice for that would have been better in such a case for that would have been better in a case for that would have been better for that a different choice for that would have been better better than a different choice for that would be better better for that would be better in such case in a case of case that would be more case you have been better in
This is dried the alternative is that you get to get your choice.
And then you spike to the foldoency of the choice that you have made you and making you that you were made a good choice.
How more options are the options of the choices of the bottom, which is the election of the choices option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave the morning, all of how often we depend the value of things that we are going to do it similar to the things that we are similar to the things that we are similar to the value of the things that we do do do that we depend the value of things that we depend the value of things that we are going to do it.
If you can indent, you can indent, you can indent, you can see the attract of all the alternatives that you deternatives that you deternatives you demost.
And that makes you fewer with the alternative that you have chosen your balance that you have chosen
A example, the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the stressure of this example.

And he's about two weeks there with the idea that he was a great parking to a great parking place that he was misled.
Peoption costitution cost of the entire we have, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are possibilities of the more connection alternatives.
And those presents are presenting us as substitutional costs.
Another example of example.
This image store is going to be a number of points.
Life here and now for example, and that you don't have to considered things that you should be considered in the way to consider the time.
Another point is that you with every choice other choices are excellent other choices.
And all that other has so attract as his attract option that are choices are getting option becomes un.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in my search for a new battacks.
I almost always spire almost always spirit to be spirit --
But, there was only one kind of stuff -- and they bought the past, you know, the past, it doesn't make it support incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were going to be awasted enough and often enough wasted enough and often enough it was going to be like this.
And after years I went to the store for a newded.
I said, "Well, I want to do a stuff, this is my met."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you whether a rhy? Wilt you whether was a whether of acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed whether a couple of the couple of the whether a rhy?
Do you have a birth with the slilimetage effect?
Do you can pipe, or flink or flink on pipy." And so he went on.
I was spraines of the one-time I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only birth that was going to be there."
He had no idea which was that was a little birth that was a long hours all the possible bits of all the possible bits of the birbits of the birth of the birth of the breed.
And then, I think is honest, I left the store of the bottom,
I had been doing it better than I could do it in all those of the possibilities I could do it.
But I didn't felt me.
Why? To this to myself this to myself, I write a book I write a book of the book of myself.
And the reason I feel better with all those choice, was that choice, was that I started expect to expect from a good spirit of a good spire spire of a good spire spire of the spire of the quickly spire of the state of the choic
I started without any any expectation, because I just just just one kind of spirit --
And then there are different wars, there are different wars, and one of the superfect.
And what I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I remote my bird with my expectations, and that asked me --
How more possibilities of people have to have more expectations they care about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less testing results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case you didn't know what I'm talking about.
In the real thing is going to be about this.
Everything was better when everything was worse.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have been surprising experiences have been surprising experiences.
In our modern society that we can expect as well as a perfection of civil we can expect to be a lot of the best we ever had to expect.
And we become rapidly, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- this is to you all the secret of happiness is not too much much expect of happiness is not too much expectation.
I want to do here -- a little bit -- a carbiographic element, I -- that I was with a woman who is really fantastic.
I have asked her with her less tester with her less testing.
But with less enough to less enough are good changes.
And finally, when you get a bad on the bad sat at the spirit as there is only one of the kind of predictions, you can ask you to ask you why you can you deal with the reason.
The answer is that case simply simple.
The world is responsible to you have no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of different bounds of them are available to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just simple. It's just simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different boundaries to fale.
So if people are decision to decide even if the results of those decision of those decision of their choice.
And they take themselves themselves quale.
In the western society clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of high time.
A factor -- not the end, but a significant factor in this explosive increases of depression and suicide self-suicide experience and suician experience of their high expectations.
And if they try to explain the teleural for themselves them to explain himself the decades.
So the nettoresulate is that we go on on the predictive is that we go on forward to present it.
Another a collabor a cooperation.
This is the official dogma, that is that by everybody is going to be attacking on everybody is going to be awful for where it becomes apart.
But that's not the way it isn't it.
It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than not cannot choose to be more folds of automatically that more choice is more choice as more choice is more choice
There's a magic flour. Well fluence on choicically. Well I don't know.
But I know that we have been for a long time to the point that choices are well-well-well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle, which we can keep the best we can keep the best to it.
The choices freedom in comduce countries comes out of material overfluence.
There are many places on the world, we have heard about before, where the problem is not so much that there is too much of choice, but right that there is too much choice.
And the paradox that I learned here with this is with the modern, which is with the modern, which is a lot of the modern, which is a lot of modern, which is a dox that I learned here with the modern, which is a lot of modern, which is with the modern, which I think I think is going to be a dox that I think about this.
That's frustrated, and this is the frustrated, Steve Levitt is told you that expensive and stuff sat on the bottoms are not helping children.
I say you the same about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help up the focusing on this thum; they were they focusing on this pige: they were they focusing on this dure, they were able choices.
They make us living less to be less to be less to be less to make us live.
If a part of what people in our society to make all of these choices to make all those choices where people have been converted to all options have to be in the life of those people have to go on on it.
And if you have lived to go on on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improve Parto-improve Proto-improve economists.
Everyone is better by reverse of the reverse of what we are with the poor people -- and that comes through the choices that we are with our lives,
And finally, if you read this image story -- if you are a moving the bottom, what does you know fish the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the who's story?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A schrale example, a shortable worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this fish, I understood that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you get the fish crazy to create possibilities, you have no freedom, but a light of the laming.
If you have the fish crossing to create possibilities, you become less too, you get less testing.
It leads to more disconnect and less dishead.
Everyone has a fish.
This is free certainly destined -- even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the residence of a figuremental fish, is asking to ask is asking to ask is to ask a displacy.
Thank you for your attention.
