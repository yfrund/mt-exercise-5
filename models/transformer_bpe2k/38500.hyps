Last year, I showed these two dias, to show that the Poice was to show that the past three million years of the size of the United Statand of 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the VSS, with 40 percent of the United Statfortune of the United Statand from the United States,
But this is actually the serious problem because it didn't show the decades of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of these.
The ice skp on the North Pole, in a way, the sheart of our global climate system
It turns out of the winter and crazy.
The next slide I show is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is purpose in red.
As you see it out of darkly blue.
That's the annual ice ice during winter of the winter.
And the crympt in summer.
The so-called permanent ice ice five years or older, is almost like flower, that from the body is silled here.
In 25 years, it's going to go this towards this to this forever.
And that's a problem because the frozen flows around the North Icell and there's a very large amount of frozen carbon is a very large amount of carbon boxes that who's the methane.
And compared with the amount of disgusting in the atmosphere, that could be double that could be double if we disgusting the amount of disguades overwriting.
In some of the undian indeep in Alaska signs of methane in the water.
Again, the last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different so.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question or we will be that.
A reason for that, is that this huge called "warm-Greenland from the north.
This is a melt twater tell.
The water volume is the waterm is greater than ever ever ever ever seen
This is the Kangerlussuac river in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soundly style because it landijs, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These flow these flow flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
Again, the months reported scientists that the whole continent has now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly in the West in the West in the South Pole is a few underwater eillands.
The whole continent is for six feet of six foot sea level of sea single stying, just like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after the largest ice ice ice ice ice ice massa, there are new brought a few years ago on and hollers.
40 percent of the world's population is gets half of his drink-water water of that melt.
In the Anthing, this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more flows up here.
But when they disappears the drinky water.
In California was a 40 percent in California, from 40 percent in the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are predictons serious.
This global dreaming drought has led to a dramatic rise of forest burns.
And the number of natural disasts all over the world is speeded with an incredible and never see seen.
Four times in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely untendable.
If you look at it from a historic context of a historic context what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours.
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, and at each sides from the Indian subcontinent, there's a behavior of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of oxygen in the oceans.
The only great cause of the global warming, near deforestation, which is the burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest challenges with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-carbon centrales.
But we see a bommale.
These are the coal-carbon that the board of the building years, and where green alternatives were annual alternatives were present years of having became forget
There is echer a political fight on the high of the gang in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industire gave years, 250 million dollars to promote "shoot coal of coal coal coal of coal --
And that image did something to think.
And on the urbs became home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons model.
You probably seen it in the news.
This is the one after largest disruple in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking at the coast was the Kerst,
Video: ""Frosty the coal is a key call, upon the guy is a key, crazy.
He's overliquid adute here in America, and he takes our economy.
Frosty the coast gue with the day with the day with the day of the day is scance.
He's paid and estimate and cute employee."
Here comes a big part of the coal in West Virginia in West Virginia.
The largest mine minine of the country is the great boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship : "Let me be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they have talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, has put two campaigns on the bottom of the numbers on the bottom for Klimate.
This is a piece of one of them.
Video "Be COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our business.
That's the reason the reason the most important goal is to give a giant containing of the light of the light and bring the light and the regardless of the truth of coal.
Facy, stead, is not smary.
We like the clean is -- and it still shes -- and it still carries there.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just about our over.
Video: Schone stead carbon, you have a lot of it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean coal coal centrale.
Fantastic! The machines are pretty much more noise.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
In spite the fact that the breaking of stebalance of one of the most important causes of the Earth is changing the remarkable schan coal coal technology that you see all the stuff that you see here.
Look at good around the clean coal coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative of our economic challenges and that on the national security.
Video: Stem: America is the economy, the economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire is in all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like dirted oil, as dirted oil.
But now there's a durly, new solution to get out of this.
And far America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get a work to work on a security that makes us safer and global warming the Earth side.
And it ended up a solution that considered enough is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Intded.
Al Gore: And the last thing.
Video: It's about giving America to give America
One of the fastest ways to make an endless of our dependence of old fuel that we helped our planet,
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investment to create jobs.
Vower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speaking that says, "If you want to be all of the time.
If you want to go far far bal."
We need to go far and quickly.
Thank you.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called back to a little bit of an update about how that machine works.
So I am a Vor those who hadn't waren't waren't warenes: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever underneath 27 miles in the entire red.
It has to be the conditions that were present less than a billions that were less than a billions of second after the universe started to be 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, so!
This is the machine underneath Generve.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors in detectors that I work with the ATLAS, detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in adding so you can see the scale.
In 10 seeptember 10 years we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that worked for a partment in the control room.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all around the way around the LHC, and with up with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was radied by particles in the detector flows in the detector of the detector of the detect of the LHC, which was a photograph
In other words, when we saw that photograph at 10 September we knew that the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this was the biggest across or this, when someone went to Google and saw the Internet page of the Internet page there.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of a cultural and as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a cultural
And a week later we had a problem with the machine, which was to do with these golden behaviors.
And they were in the behaviors of thousand amper when the machine on the entire power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small dragon."
They can do that because they are supermoved on on very low temperaturs.
So on minus 27, and on the minus of the stars, that can be between the stars, that can be flowed to be able to behaviors that flow down into the space between the stars, that can be flowed in the stars, that can be flowed by the stars, that flow up in the stars, that flow up in the stars, that flow up in the stars, that flow up in
In one of the connections between nine of the nine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was the wire was wire of the wire of electric resistance against that 13 thousand ampeers.
This was the result.
This is even more impressive if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets were mostly moved in about 30 inches.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all have them when all repaird.
Now, they are back on the road.
Eind map the LHC will be again.
We'll put it back back and we expect it to measure and expect that we can go further with expect to figure out what the building stone of the universe.
Now, of course, they have the debate again, they have started to re-up the value of scientific research of scientific research.
I think the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go beyond than it beyond the LHC.
I let me the last words of the English scientist Humphrase Davy, I would have been able to take the divided of his students who are learning the value of his students, his students, his learning was Michael Farave is so dangerous for the progress of human spirit of human mind that we have to take our images of science definitive to be a mysteries in the natural world of scientists are not a new new world of nature, and that there are no new world of natural world are no new new new new new new new new new new new ons."
Thank!
I would like to start with you back to your children back to your children at your children at your children play.
When you discovered how you had to put it up and they went up and improved, and you know, you were actually learning problems to solve through the environmental relationships of space relations.
Ruing insight is very strong dealing with understanding the world around us.
If a information that if an informed inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my fish -- with my adviser Jee-from Kalanithi -- I started asking writing -- what if we would ask a computer that some of the environmental fingertop of the anital fingertop that moretils on a plate desolid of the desophic information that is flow with the information of the information that would be able to deskills
and can ordering as we want?
And this question help, that we decided to look for a answer, by building Siftables.
Cortation cooked is a Siftable computer size of a cow of a cow of cow of a cow of a cow of cow --
They can be movement with the hand, they can put together their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and put them a screen and wireless the contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade is the physical trade as they can be moved by it.
And the most of the Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for ways of digital information.
And this is that these having a more physical differences, conscious, of their movement and even of the way we move and even of the way we move and functions.
And I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video that is instant to tell a video that plays and others and others and others and played a little bit of the crowd,
This interactive portraits are conscious.
Then next to each other other of them will be put together, they will be interested in each other.
If they are surround, they notice this and can be a little bit of nervous become a little nervous thing.
and then they feel movement and calling it and calling it and calling it and cally.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all gestures, as it excited, as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquistop.
In this example three Siftells of the example of Siftes, and I can use them to go color in a empty of totally --
If we have exercise we went back a little bit back.
There are some of the city of potential for education, mathematically playful games with language, mathematics and logic that we want to give people the possibility to see things rapidly immediately, and the result immediately,
So here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci through a simple acci account programatic programmate.
Here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of every Siftoot letter in every Siftle, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
In a 30 seconds is it becomes very recred, and applies a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm playing them in the Media Lab, and I have a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions are need.
Everything you have to say, "Most of word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some of the other people test the test one.
That's our youngest ber right.
And it turns out that he was able to stack the Siftell.
And for him this was just blocks.
Here is a little bit of painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language of language language
This is Felix that demonstrat.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that carakter of the table with that carakter of the table with that carried the table of the table.
He's leaving the sun risk.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene
Video: The orantractor.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And in the scuaming of Siftles, and it can be able to put the carakters in the carakters with each other, Video: Word -- Video: Word to do the card!
DM: and so his own story of tell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to deal with how it goes down.
Video: The cat fly.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music chilment that we developed with a sound tables a sound produces a sound produces like the lead, bass and pressure like the lead, bass and pressure like the lead, bass and pressure like the lead, bass and pressure
Aenieder has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the argue that you can be injected so you can see the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way, and there's live controllable effects of a spring-available effects and filter.
They are being able to case sound and added by the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound and adapted by the sound and adopted by the sound and adopted by the sound of sound.
And it is the general effects like tempo and volume that are added on the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern of the entire pattern of the entire pattern on the entire pattern to the entire pattern
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a lead in two Siftooles, to a first pattern to a first pattern, by a lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I feel like a bit of slagwork.
Video: And now I copy the movie to the prins, so I can affect the effect live the effect live in the effect live in the effect of the press, so I can affect the effect of the presses, so I can affect the effect live the effect of the drums, so I can affect the dru
Video: DM: I can accelerating it by the office of the pace of the pace blocky.
Video: DM: Now I copy the movie for the movie for the more expression.
Video: DM: I can reach the pattern as it is played it.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything I can improvise and make the very longer and make a little bit like I want.
In the finally of the dimitted dimitted by the volume Siftable to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is going to get to make new people of the interfaces that are better interfaces that are better destrokes in the way our brains and bodies work and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design, in this design, and a few possibilities that we develop in the lab in the lab that we developing in the lab
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the atsize to a whole new generation of aid tools for interacting with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hard.
And I look at it for you all of you all of you all of you know.
I'm writer.
Bue is my work, but also writing is so much more than that.
My whole life long I've been writing writing and I don't think that that will change ever change.
And yet there is a little bit of owners, and career, and career, which I had to be relationship with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work on with my work on the relationship to see my relationship with my work to be a career, which is improved.
It started with a book that I wrote across a memoired, "Ed, B, Bids, Beminning that very very contradiction to my earlier work all over the world went on and an international exister to my first of international existered with a very existic.
And the consequence is that people now and always have to be everywhere, and always told me as if I did have to be touched like I did now have to be touched and always teged to be told and always teged me as if I did have to be told and always told teged.
And so that is what -- gets do -- gets the going!
People come to me and ask and questions "Do you don't afford you can never eat this success, you know, you don't have a success,
Are you going to keep your whole life will keep your whole life but never write anymore a book that people for warm.
Are you going to have to be there?"
It's very disrusted -- you know.
Of course, that would be very of, I remember in the running 20 years ago -- I was a teenager, I was a teenager,
People said, "Do you don't have that you never get succes?
Do you don't have to be able to deal with it by it?
Do you don't have your life to this work is going to be able to do this work without that there's ever ever something from the pine, and you will die on be a little bit of your broken with your mouth with your mouth away from fail?"
Something in that stret;
And in the short comes to the questions on this questions on this saying, "Ja."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called "enmed.
All of the time.
But I am also for a lot of other things that you don't know what it was all of the things that all of it.
For for a seaweer and other engine, and other environment.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that I write the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be a job that they are to work for the earth of their people,
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make us to make the effects of the mindnesial system, which is something that doesn't happen at the time doesn't happen at the same time.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he had somebody ever asked somebody ever asked somebody ever asked him for a little bit of that was not afraid for it.
And so of that, "Yohn, how did it with your chemistry?"
No, so it didn't get about it.
To be fair to be fair chemistracted by the centuries have not been the reputation of manically, for a male depressive alcohosts.
You know, they have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers in the other creative people have apparently been pretty instable, instable.
but you just look at the grim death the most magnife creative minds.
Many display of young, often by own own slide.
And even those who don't even those who don't seem to be under a suicide of their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave placement.
In the last interview for his death for his death said, "Don't be a piece of my books is a piece of myself."
That's kind of saying about your life,
But of this kind of quote we don't look like this.
We all heard it before, and have heard it with all of the accepted.
The reason the thought, is that creativity is that creativity is unlose-ash and that a artist-exist will lead to mise the eventually lead to mise the same thing.
So I want to ask everyone today anyone today is that idea of life?
Fince you do that OK?
Because now I think I think I don't think I think it's not a very tighand all of the way that I don't think it's all the way to be a very high.
I think it was reflected to the resident.
And even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is so on.
We can spend a lot better appropriate better than to live.
And I'm sure that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my mind thought.
Surely the phase where my career, my career,
Go took, I am a young, a veil, you know, a lot of it.
I can spend four decades.
And then, probably everything I now will be even more of the outside of the outside of the extraordinary world as the work that extraordinary book.
We're with friends with friends under the other, so I can be selling you is my greatest success is behind me.
Jemig, what an idea!
If you go so and think, you're going to know the morning, you know the morning,
So I don't want to be that.
I love rather ther working with the work that I love the work that I love the work I love a lot of work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I have come to the conclusion that I can just go through writing if I can just go through write when I build a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion that I can just go through with writing as a psychological protection in the process of the conclus
I have to write a safe distance between myself and my conversation between myself and my conclude in the very understanding angst for the response to my future publications.
I did the last year, I went out to ways to do that.
I am in history and I do it and explores in other societies of the societies of people have found or others have found people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search of my quest in the old Greeks and Romens.
And then you have a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romands and Romera and Rommust be of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a godledless of a display, unknown for the human beings to the human beings accountable reasons.
The Greeks called these guians, these beods of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that way that we have words him in the way that we have words to fluist.
The Roman had a species of the same idea.
And if you were a genidented creative mind creative mind."
And the funny is that the Rombs with a genius don't have a very pienter person attacks.
In their policy was a genius of a kind of magic goddle-support entities that were helped in the walls of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house
If the artist, if the artist, the genius assistance.
and it was the working.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I talked about earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work --
The artists was taken so in protection was taken by the birth of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant, you don't get all honor for that.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible genius you had helped it.
And if you were calling your work is just just slow it to you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genia.
And the time that has been the way in the West in the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there is a very new ideas is the individual human idea: the individual human beings is the center of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical beings, has been sent from the godledledle of the world
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual case.
And for the first time in history was said that they were about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not the first time in the
I have to say that I think a big mistake --
And so for one person, one single individual individual that he or she or she or she is the vehicle of the century mystery, of all the godledly, creative and the known preservation and the known preservation and the known forcement for a fragic human psyche.
It's like you ask someone asks the sun into the sun.
Egos are being seen to gigantic proportions and there are increased improspersancy to prestations of prestations
And I think this pressure has made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists have made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists have made a lot of artists of artists have made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists the last 500 year.
And if it's so and I think, I think, "What now?"
Can we do this differently.
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can have 500 years, we can rational rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speech.
Probably in the audience people who revealed scientific people who have refell in the idea that elfar beats with some of the fact that are bring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to get me that I will all get you in there.
And yet me wonder, I would.
Why not?
Why would we have that not thought not the thought of that thought,
It fast as much as wells as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculate that declines are in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, the creative process here -- it doesn't always rational behave.
And that sometimes it feeling it sometimes almost paranormy.
I have the great American closer American closer to meet Stone of the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to met.
She's writing in the nine-graining whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood, on the Virginia.
Some times if she was on the field of the work was felt them a poem of the country.
And it was so like a big wave air came out of a big wave air of a wave air
And so the golfd than the country to its country to its country to its country to its country to its country to its country to its country to her in the country to her.
She felt that the ground, she started shake up and knew that her at that points her at that points her life: renes for her life.
She ran home, and she had to go through the poem and she had to do it as quickly as possible.
When the poem by her hundred of her honor-shot waves her only chance to write it on the way to write it on the poem of writing it was that her only came up with her honor.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and ring them ran and ran doesn't go home.
As this now, the poem of poem by her him, through her purch, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different poet.
And it was a lot of the way -- this is I think it beautiful part of the story -- that they have the poem of the story --
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper the paper and paper the paper by her.
And at that potlement had a ptly.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plutile out of the sky.
She took it back into his tail, and it back into her body, and it back into her body, and it back into her body,
And in that cases came up with the poem that was very close to paper in the paper of paper was trouble.
When I heard that I thought -- what is happen to be my creative process.
That's the how my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who is a mouth, who is flowing up and trans up with blood, sweand trans through it, swe'd continue to be through it.
But even in the daily swing, I had this experience.
You will also know it yourself, that feeling that creative ideas in your record of a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that it for resource?
How can we use it without we get it without a conceptable?
At a way that is good for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago I wouldn't interviewed it for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life the example has been the shows of the contemporary artists that are trying to get out of all power of the power that is trying to get the unconservable creative impulsed in him that are takes in him that are actually able to impulse in him of his life in him that are going to be able to get out of the conte
With the years, Tom was a little bit more more quickly the years.
And one day he in Los Angeles about the fast road, and changed the process of radical.
And as he was so he heard of a melodie.
And the decided to him, as inspiration that is crazy, inired the inspiration of it.
It was a beautiful melodd and he wanted to hold it it.
But it didn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no paper at the tanks.
The well-known exciting excited, and then the melodd of the galoddd and then it stays to me behind me behind eternature of the both of eter-a-century.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panick, but he put that whole mental process and did something news.
And he looked up to the sky and said, "Do you don't hear that I have behind the sense I have behind the sense of the sky.
"Do you really think I can do this song, you know, I can write a song,
If you really want this song that this song, you have to add when I have time for you.
And not, you know, somebody else else else.
Go neighborh." And from that point that points the time when it lots of a lot of different.
And the work itself is the same thing with the known of the dark undertoon.
But the heavy that the creative process in the creative process in him of the geniius.
The genius was going to close to the skind and lived just square.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go on the bottom of it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the conversation between Tom and the profoundly of Tom themselves was not completely of Tom themselves.
That story has changed my way of working.
I had already a little bit of it.
I was in the middle of the writing process of Een, Bids, Beminning.
And at a point of point I left in despair.
You know that you want to be working, but not well, you know, it's a terrible disaster disaster is the worst book.
Not just bad -- it's really terrible bad thing.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project of all the project of the project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember, and I decided to be a pot way.
I wonder of my manuscrips, and I focused to a very empty of the room.
And I said to this hardope thing, we know that when this book is not just because of this book is not only by me.
You can see that I have everything in the way I have.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better than you have to get your thing.
You can you do that? Do you don't thank you.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notils are suspect that you have to be seen on office on office on off."
Tja--- United it comes up here.
Euwen ago came in the North African desert people together to dance with monthliming in a month,
And third and hours, to the morning slides of the morning slide.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, a very higher hours something extraordinary is happened.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen a little bit of you have ever seen something in a performer.
It was like the time was stilling and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights in it, but now everything together.
And suddenly he didn't seem to be a human beings a human beings
In him, under him of it was slide it.
A goddless fire.
If you did something happened when it happened to kill people what it was Dan started calling them and crops, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun, historic fact, when Moren Moren Spage Spain Spain Spain this living with them.
The quote is etered by the centuries of "Allah."
And that we have today in the day of displaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magically, is to me, "Allah, ol oil, okay, oh, great, brok."
An understanding of God.
And the recipe we need.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the dance of the next morning that he discovered that he discovered that he has no goddledless of a godled.
At that moment, he's a little parent guy with the ances that will never come to such more to be highs.
Maybe there's no one more of the person will never calling anybody while is dance.
What do he now is that with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell that is really hard to sell creative minds.
But it doesn't have to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful it.
Now, imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person are coming out of your person from your person from your person from your person are coming out of your person are coming out of your person are coming out of your person are coming out of your person from your person are coming out of your pers
And imagine you believe that you have them a while, you know, you have a while,
When you get ready with it, they are given to someone else.
And it was all of the way off.
I have incentive to do this thought of thought.
The last months I've worked on a book that will be soon be shifting that will be approach. The book where a lot of too long time is challenged to be extincluded out of the book that will be approach.
The operating that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me on the hand, I like to go and go on the same on: Don't see the same one.
And just you work.
just do you do thing, whatever it is.
If you have task you to dance you go and dance you go and dance you will be dance.
If the goddledless of you, the demands to make in your work at any time at some point of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of "Oh, yeah, then
And it doesn't explain that, thank you just go.
And also then, "O!"
I believe that I believe that of heart.
"Oh, anyway!"Ah, because we have a pure human love and property, but by the stay of the enduring of the pure of human love and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
You know, I've had been talking about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what it can mean, and what it means, and the discovering of genes.
We actually start from a new point: we were the biology to digitize the digital code to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology with the design and synthesizing and synththesizing and synthesizing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living is something I think I think of a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels.
We tried different approach, it back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of digitizing it right now,
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try and ask to ask life -- can we create life -- or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can reach itself in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nature smaller genome can be able to get a nature of genome
We can go out of the hundred of them out of the 500 or who's 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolan card is that relative to the metabolic card,
And I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can challenge per piece of the genes that this would be a living cell of life.
And we decided to do that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the components so we could do the components to make the components to be able to ask the fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome of the chromosome of the synthis?"
Stakes the chemistry it to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome "up?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical inges of chemical inds material.
So, our saling of digitizing the digitizing of life is accelerated in exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather rather slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code
And our last point of point it would put on a momential curve.
We're going to have started with this over 15 years ago
There were some stages for a few stages for a bio-ethic acction prevent to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is really difficult is very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult to be very difficult.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA make little pieces in length of the world that make a little bit more fals. So the longer you make it piece of the longer you get it to be a piece of it.
So we had to make a new method for converting these little pieces and correct the little pieces of all the mistaks.
And this was our first attempt, begin to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces did the pieces did the foutcorrectly
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning part of a piece of chemical chemical chemical chemical code in the bacteria genetic code and viral particles went and make viral particles.
The viral particles were going to be out of the cells, they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was going to be rather with the oil industry, and I said she said that model but all too well.
They laugh more than you laught more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build its own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial ch
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could various --
to understand what the concluming components of a living cell of a living cell of a living cell to understand what the contemporary components are the contemporary components of a living cell of a living cell to understand what the real.
The design is crucial, and if you start starting with digital information in the computer than that it has to be very accuraft.
When we first of this genome for the first time we were the standard of the first one was the standard precision one mistake.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 mists. If we had the original sequence than the original sequence than it was not able to start on the original sequence.
More of the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters that have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to design so that they can design design so that they can design so that they can go together.
We design in this way.
Maybe you have read that we put water water brands into water brands.
Bethinking, we have a four-litery genetic code: A, C, Gene and T.
Trios of those code for smooth 20 aminozurs -- that there's a single dedication for every aminoxxygen of every aminoxxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, send in the way of writing words, though.
Aanvanly we have a signment,
Some of them were dealing that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzymes.
There are enzymes that they repay and put together together.
And we started to make pieces of a pieces that were five to 7,000 letters of 7,000 letters long and you have a pieces of 24,000 letter, you take a 24,000 letter, then sets of 72,000.
In every stage of the major of these pieces of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process of a process that is very robuust -- that will be very robud.
We're trying to achieve the point of automatism.
So this looks like a basketbale.
And once we get to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares, they don't grow so easily more in E.
That explains the most of the modern tools of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to the other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolog recombination it, that is used by the biology to repairs, that is used by the biology to repairs, that can add pieces of the bits of solid of DNA
Here's an example of that.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million radio radiation of radiation on the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of radiation called Deinocococcus radio durance to radio durans in the way.
And that is actually in the top panel, sophic is just sing a chromosome from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it back into the size of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dry droughly dry.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there are life in space, that can be moving to move forward, a new aquaticks.
NASA has show that there's a lot of the way, there is a lot of this:
Here's a dealt micro-photographs that we made with these processes -- in fact, in fact, in fact, with just yester-mechanisms with the right design.
And it gives them that it is that it is circumulate it
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope
These are photos, genomes of a six seconds.
This is the publication that we exbrought to exbrand and
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a humans, with a distant structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then 142 pages to just the genetic code the genetic code down.
Now, how do we started a chromosome chromosome of the activate on?
And it was clear a virus is a very easy.
And it's a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a little bit of eukaryots, like us, you just know the cell and does another in, and that's what you know when it comes out of the cell and that's what you know when it looks.
In the bacterial species is the chromosome of a cell, but we have a full transpllant that we can have a full transplltation of a chromosome of a cell transplant from a cell to another one, and it can do activity.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a microbes of a microbes of a micro-co-side.
These are about this is about as people and mickly as people and mice.
We feed some extra gene so that we could select this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of the extra
We have it with anzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be able to appear -- and you will apply the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell -- and you will appear the cell -- and you will be a very advanced in the cell -- it was a very advanced in the cell of the cell of the cell -- and you will be appetition as we put it was a
We even thought he would come to talk about it, but we tried to set the process of what we did was going to go out and developing the process of what we thought was going to come out of what would come out of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all sorts of species that have a second chromosome of the second chromosome of third chromosome of thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that are proposed to proposed to be a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that restriction enzymes that are actually called DNA that really are taking DNA
The chromosome that in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of the chromosome in it.
It was express it was expresent the other chromosome of the chromosome of the material, and so we had the eventually got the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the material, it was just with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the material,
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the charteristics of the species of the new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell we put in the cell we put in the cell we put in the cell of the cell of the new software that we stop.
All the protein the membranes changed -- when we launched the genetic code in which it was changed.
This is a monkey as genomical alchemistry, but we're in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Now, I've been paying earlier that this is not a creation of a creation -- this is a mayboard of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I pay evolution, and I pay that we might be almost a new version of the Cambrian explosion that maybe there are a lot of new species that are based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs is.
We're going to be soon from six-and-a-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
And so to put it in my context in my context of 1946.
There are three people on this planet,
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 46.
We have trouble with food, with the squath water, medicine, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's going to be hard to do that for nine to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collecting five billion vessels of coly.
That's 100 miloons of these 100 millions of day.
When we take biological processes in the ogency or what process process than also to replace that a huge challenge; then it goes a huge challenge.
And then there's all these carbon dioxide of the dioxide of the atmosphere.
And in all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We're preservation by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques of techniques to do so-called "combination called combination genomics.
We've now got the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimize processes or tries to optimize or medicines or drugs, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard of selection.
We can select select for livbirth chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, etcinproduction, etcine, and so on.
This is a screen map-imagination of what real designs that we work on the gang and work that we can actually get to the point and a new kind of the computer.
We don't know person how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code of how their genetic code of the genetic code of how their genetic code of how their genetic code of what their genetic code of what their genetic code out of how their genetic code of how their genetic code of their genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of what their genetic code of the see.
We focus on fourth of fourth generation.
Rushing you have seen to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuels that will come out of like sugar to come up to more high-high-grains like octan or of butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price, and we think the availability to reduce the availability as we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are the first food of all, and so we think we are the first fourth of the first fourth generation that we do the first fourth generation of burn within about 188.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- -- but by our global discoveries -- we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, with a half miles of the deep, with a head temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with the help of molecular water drogen as energy.
We're looking at the whether we can take CO2 and cut through pipes through pipes that are easily through the CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question, "What is life?"
We have reality, we know -- you know, the purchase the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where then where?
A important energy source is becoming a source of energy source.
But we also work on the use of these tools to think of these tools to think quickly servaccines of these tool.
This year there was the flu -- we always walk just like the facts of the facts of the facts that it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the shapes of the shapes of shapes that can change
And here you see how the future can see that evolution is going to change the evolution tree, the evolution tree, the accelerating of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're even more away from people.
Our goal is to assume that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive for a long enough to do that you might be able to survive.
What I want to show you as a little bit quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft -- this is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you locally or on the distance with immense amounts of data can work work with immense data can work
We're looking at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can bring the solid of the magnitude and the sorting to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information we are these collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera picture, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel
It all makes nothing because it was going to influence the prestations would be influence on a galory system is the amount of pixeless is on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a full example of data.
This is a graue house through Dickens. Each ke column.
And to prove that it is really text, and not just imaging, and no imagination, we can do something that is really text is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way of read to read a h-book of e-book in a girl.
I wouldn't confidence.
This is a realistic example. This is a except of The Guardian.
Every big depiction is the beginning of a substance of a subject.
This is actually gives you the fun, and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also did something with the corner of this except of The Guardian.
We made a ness advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have institute information -- and we have institutes information --
If you want to see the opportunities of this car -- you see it here.
or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen of the things that we can do the constraints of hands through the bestraints through the limitations of the constraints through the screen through the screen through the constraints of the constraints of the constraints through the limitations of do the constraints through the screen through the screen of the constraints of the constraints of
We hope that this is not pop-ups and other things like and other things that will be more flaul -- not needed to be more than it will be more than it will be more than it will be more than it to be more flaul -- not needed to be more flaul -- not neet.
Of course, the lands are a maps of the considered application for a technology like these, I won't spending time to spend up here is except that we can contribute to be able to contribute this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of a image of the NASA
So let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which is connected with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promodus at the University of Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's been made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this -- you see that we experienced by the images and the multi-resolution and experience.
The space shake of the images has this meaning is the meaning of the images here.
The computer vision vision algorithms have brought together so they have to across the real space -- the Grassssi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashhows, and all these things are space that are space of television, and all these things are space that are space of the space -- and all these are space gives of the things are space
I'm not sure or there is another time is there is another environments.
There are more space that there are more space there.
I want to like one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we work this summernth that we have this summer, to the communicate is the realm of this technique of this environments to look at the environments on our website.
We had to do it with the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures from Flickr. You're just looking for a Dame on in Flickr, and you get images of people in the two shirts, and the campus and the campus and thirts, and campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and thirs, and you get a campus and the campus of the Notre Dame with a picture. You just look for images from people in Flickr. Youts and you just get a little bit of the campus and the campus and thircampus
And each of these orange chain gives a image that was part of this model.
And so all these Flickr images that are copied in this way of speaking in this way of speaking in this way of spending --
And we can do simple way in simple way navigate ners.
You know, I never thought I would have thought I would have ever work.
It's overwhelming to be so exciting to be so exciting.
I believe you can see that this is many types of cameras are cameras are cameras -- all of the mirror to be a big number of it, connected in this environment.
And I'll try and find some strange of a strange imagery.
There are so much covered by facing faces and things like that.
And nowhere between this is even a series of photos -- here they are all of the things are -- here they are.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churged by the program.
If we dive through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is used the data of everyone -- from the entire collective memory of how we can do it -- and the everyone looks at each other.
All these pictures are conversation and shapes a lot of bigger than the short of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth is going to be able to get a model that was going to be a model that is going to be a model that is going to be there.
So this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Artual Artual Again,
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it as it uses and the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are provided to be able to put somebody else in the fact that somebody else in the way.
If anyone of these health would like to clip their names and their names and their names are going to be able to clip with all of the data, and I can use as an access to the space, which I can use the access to that space, which is using all the photographs, and created with this kind of cross-model, and created with this kind of cross-model, and created with all of the kind of cross-up to the space and then a kind of cross-up to that space with all of the took of the same experience modeldeldeldeldeldeldeldel
And of course, the be-product virtual model of this is an immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which not only is from the skills and other applications is in the collective -- but also from the collective searching from the collective search.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I understood that what you do is possible to make a day, in the next years, in the next years, all images that are the images that can copy with everybody in the world can cople the world together in the world can copy with the world together in the next year?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovering this is discovering
It creates to your wise, hyperlinks between images desire images between images desire of images.
And it does that based on the data in the images of the data in the images of the data in the images of the data in the images of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is described much of these images are available to have a lot of these images are definitely exciting as much of these images are exciting in which a lot of these images are defining with the wealth of these images are available information that is available to have a lot of exciting of these images are available information that is available to think about a lot of the wealth of these images accross as you think of these picture.
When you look for images you look for images, you put a searching in, and you have a searching of the information of the information of what the image is going to be able to do a lot of information about what the image represents of what the image of information about what the imagery.
What if now if now is that copied to all your image images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes from that prevent comes out of that. It's a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.

It's a amazing example of how a nation enough of how a nation is able enough.
And finally, I think it's clear to think it's clear to who's high, at least for whom to these high-foot of the world is that they actually don't get away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are about twices of the human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us -- the dreams will be the dreams of these children, just like the one, part of a unconfion of hope.
What we do finally in National Geographic, is extremely from the idea that politicians never achieve anything.
We think that polemic -- we think a polemic -- we believe that a polemics that stories we believe that storytellers in the world that we are the best tellers in the world. Our website is 35 million times a month, we have in 156 million times a month-besist-magazines a million-public.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you with you about some questions that I have a book that I have a book of the book of the question.
Maybe you see paralls of the information of other sources.
And then try and explaining some of the connecting that you might have been telling you that you might have been telling you that you might have been too.
And I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the Western indualized society.
And that official dogma is adapted to be the prosperity of our citizens in the highest level of our citizens, we have to give them as much individual freedom individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human beings of the human existence.
And the things that is assumps freedom of us to do to act a higher which is to achieve without insances without insides.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices hold in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well-be.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be done would be done would be doubt.
And in our life is this dogma celebrated big.
And I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Right?
And in the time that 175 changes is the 175 changes there are in my supermarket, there are in my supermarkets and twell and twalready different trees and tweless bome.
And you can make a touch of the end, for the case between those 175 species for you, of course, for you'll nothing in it.
So that's the owning of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can put your stereoset and your stereoset -- loudspeakers, cash cash -- cash task of it.
At one electronicastore you can choose from this number of the number.
You can put together six-and-a-half million different systems, with parts of those story.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, a different example -- communication.
When I was young for long ago, you could all sorts of phones, you could ask all sorts of the entire Bell.
You home it it up. You don't bought it.
That was the same thing that had never been the advantage that it never got to be a piece of the same thing.
And that time is fortune of time.
And in fact, there are a lot of different contained.
And in the cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with behind player, neusher and cry-break bringing and new-break brandom.
And you don't have seen this model in the store of the store of the store of that that happens in the store that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and assume this question.
And you know how the answer that question is that question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much of it doesn't do too much of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact of choices is a fact.
Gealth care, it's in the United States is not the United States is not that you go to the doctor and you tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor and say, "We can do A A to do, or we can do B to do Bee --
This is forward this forward and after that.
BB has this forward and nadle?"
And you say, "Doc, what do you find you?"
And the doctor says, "A has this prevented and B has this preserves, and B has this preserving, and spotes.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doc, if you were mean you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own investing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but in fact that the heavy of decision of decision of decision of someone with someone who has a sea -- to a slippeace -- to a sick of a sea and not the best condition to take decisions, and not the best condition to take decisions.
And I think of course, it doesn't have any of it, because the goal-group, you and I cannot buy.
Why do do do if we can't buy them.
Because they think that we think we are the next morning our doctor our doctor to ask that other brand ask that other brand ask the other brand ask that other brand ask the other brand ask the next morning our doctor our doctor of the other morning our doctor of the next morning our doc
Our identity, right? A engine, and it's a competition of choices, as you can see in this slide of choices like you can see on this slide.
Our identitity is is able to lose our background.
We like we find ourselves from -- so often we want.
Every single morning to be able to think about what person you want to be thinking,
Let's talk about the marriaged of marriaged family.
There has been a time that freeze, all of the people of carrying out of the way, you can get as quickly as possible to children start to children start to children.
The only thing that was with who's who's not when and what you did did was going to do --
Now, you have all the way for everything to crazy.
I teach a in particular intelligent students, which I have done percent of the people who are educated than ear.
They don't have sunch of the solid or in the earlier time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Will I whether marries or now?
Or do I wait? Do I first children, or a career or a career e?"
These are all the way of asks.
They go through to answer them to a answer as it means that they don't have all their homework and by no good number of them and get no good number of them.
And they have right. They're important life questions.
And then we get to work with work in work. Carl just about that technology us to work every minute of every day in the world that is also -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, which I love secret, which I love the Wii does it.
I don't think I think because I don't want to keep that for myself.
But anyway, that we have a huge choicy choice of work in that we are increasking ourselves, or we go on and we'll work or not.
We can look at a football of our son the son, with our son the one hand, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and the Blackberry, and the Blackberry.
And even if they all come out of the things that are we all of that compete with all sorts of questions, "Am I asked this phone answer?
Would I response this email took this letter -- all I writing this let?"
And even if the answer "Nea," and we experience the football of our son a very different way.
And what we also look at it, the small, the materialistic things -- the materialistic things -- life styl: life is a matter of choices.
And this is the world used to look like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choices of choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad bad or bad right?
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what we know is good about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
That huge choicy choicy has two effects, two negative effects on humans.
A very contradictation is that it has been more paralyzed than being lived than being listening it.
And so many choices people find the hard to be a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of that, a research of investment in voluntary pension plans.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vecovers about 2,000 vecases.
They found that for every 10 policy policy funds that the worked on the worked far two percent of the most two percent of the detect of the detect two.
At fifty-farming decades did 10 percent less employees than five than five and why?
Because it in fifty of fifty is so hard to choices people who are just going to choice people to the choice to the next day, and that on it, and so on.
And from the destroy comes away.
That doesn't mean that that people don't have any dry people after their pensionation because they have not been a dry for money to eat because they have seen the choice as a choice as a hard that they have a versadless of it.
And they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year,
The worked was a couple of the contribution to double.
So too many choicy can be lowered to work
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it goes to be the century to you like to do very very very happy to do the right choice, right?
You don't want to be skeped with the wrong phone, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect is the first effect is that we have the lost of our disruption of our disaries and choose the result of the result of the result than it would be if we had less options have had less options as we had less options as we had less options as we had less options are like we had less options of the things that would be like we have less oper
There are multiple reasons for that.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it can look like the choice was not perfect.
You put you in this case, that a different choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative is that you get you to get out of your choice.
And then you spike to the entire of the choice that you have made you in the choice that you were made a good choice.
The more options there are the more options of the choice of the things that are elected of the choice of the choice of the choice of the geost option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional cost costs.
Dan Gilbert gave takes all of how often we make the value of things that we are similar to the things that we are similar.
If you can think, you can inthink, you can inthink, you can see many alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives that you detect the end.
That makes you fewer touches with the alternative that you have chose --
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you --
This is a little bit of the stress of this example.
This is a set of vaacation in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second well.
They are on a beautiful strand. Straling weather.
Don't be able to do not? "Don't be a gusty thinks that man, "it's augusty.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could care my car for the door to the door."
And he's about two weeks, with the idea that he has this idea that he crimp every day parking a great parking place for every day for a great parking place for every day for every day
And they have a stitutional costs of the entire that we have, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are more possibilities are more engineering alternatives.
And those are presenting us as a substitutional cost of us as substances.
Another example.
This image store tune to a number of points.
Life in here, and now for example, and you don't have to go out and do things not have to consider things that you don't have to consider things that you have to consider things that you don't have to go to that.
Another point is that you have with every choice other choices of choice.
And all of that other has so his attractive options, which is the chosen optic is getting the chose of the things that are being touched in the end.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this is my quest for a new breeding new one.
I walk almost always speaking.
but if you were just one kind of more jumped bought and you bought it was a huge totally uncomfortable to be incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the breet, you know, felt the birth of the blown of the balance of the bombs of it was OK.
And after years I went to the store for a newd.
I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you want to be a rhy? Do you want to be a riting?
Do you want a bridge with the boardment effect?
Welt you exwalked out something that is extraordinary py." And so he went on.
I was spoke of a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want the only one."
He had no idea which was a hour for hours that was a hour long hours all the possible ones to all the possible ones.
And it was very honesty, I left the store of the winkle with a explored breet.
I had done better before. And I could do it anywhere I could do better do it in the engine.
But I don't felt me better.
Why? Well, for myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of a book of a book of the book of the book of this one.
The reason I don't feel better, with all of this choicy was that I started expecting more of a good job of a good speeds of a good speak of a good speaking.
I started without any expectancy, because I just started to be a kind of spalmost kind of spalmost kind of spalmost expected.
And then it turned out there would be different and one of them would be a perfect.
What I was bought was good to be perfect.
And so I compared my breeding with my expectations, and that asked me television,
The more possibilities people have the more expectations they have coaded about the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less racing with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
And in the really is going to be about that.
Everything was bad when everything was bad was bad to the power was worse.
Because when everything was worse to be a lot of people could have a third experience.
In our modern society can we as well as a well-perfection, but the best we can achieve perfection, but the best we could ever achieve is that something as well as we had expected.
Never we are surprise that we are surprising because our expectations, my expectations, are tor-high --
The secret of happiness -- for you all of this -- the secret of happiness is not expected.
I want to assuming here -- a car biographic element, I am with a woman that is really fantastic element,
I didn't put me with her under with her less rate.
But with less enough takes are good operating with his good sides.
And finally, when you have a bad on a bad sit as you buy a bad like one of the prevent of predicting is just one kind of prevent -- you can ask you why you are untouched to why you are untouched to be able to ask you to be a bad of prev
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bills are available and you buy it turns out to the responsible?
The answer that is just as simple. It's just as simple.
You have a better choice of choice.
With hundreds of different birth of a while you don't have a fale.
So if people decisions are making up the results of those decisions, they're good, they're televisions about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clearly clinic depression under the younger generations.
A factor -- not the end, but it's a significant factor in this explosive increasingly of depression and suicide them, is that people have so often teleuring experiences have to have a high expectances.
And when they try to explain that the teleuration for themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettoresull is that we have talked about it, but our bad of it, but our bad shape.
Another collaborate a containing thing.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is being took for where is residend.
But it's not.
It doesn't mean it doesn't choose that can choose be better than not able to choose is not automatically that more choice is even more choice is even better.
There's a magic ground: There is a magic foundly on choice.
But I know that we are already for long time is that choicy us are profoundly away that we have our well-being.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm ready almost ready -- a principle that we can keep our best one.
The choicy of distrialized countries is prevent from material over,
There are a lot of places on the world, there are much earlier, where the problem is not so much choice, but there's too much choice, but there's too few choice.
So the paradox that I believe here is a name for the modern, so that we have to be able to moderne,
That's frustrers, and it's all the strap of this is not told you that expensive and hard to installing children are not helping children. Sund your money. Sun.
I say the same about this thure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help up: they focus on the same thing.
They make our lives less worth.
If a part of what people in our society to make all of these choices to make all those choices of people have been transmitted to countries where people have to go forward.
And we have our lives would go on it.
That's what economists is a better economists call a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reverting reparation of well-whether poor people -- and that's because of the choicy that we with our our lives.
And finally, if you read this image story -- if you read like a development, "Ah, what does it know about it?
Nothing is possible in a fish coming in a fish."
A scrale example, a short slide -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think, about the longer I understand that this fish is the same smart is the same smart is a smart.
Because in fact, in fact, there's this on the fish to the fish of the fish to create opportunities, you have no freedom, but it's a light lambaly, but it's a light of the fish.
If you get the fishing to create potential to create potential peace.
It leads to more suspect and less rate.
Everybody has a fish.
This is freeze certainly constrained -- possible for the fish, but certainly for the fish.
But the absence of a figural fish to questions to be asking for a single to response,
Thank you for your attention.
