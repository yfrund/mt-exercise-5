Forig year I showed these two dia's slip to show that the pool, who had the pools of the vailable of the vastable of the U.S, with 40 percent of the U.S. S, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is the scat the first of this specific problem because it doesn't the animals of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice sheap on the North Pole is in a sense of the square of our global climate system.
It's called in the winter and crimps in the sheat.
The next slides I showing is a version of what is happening the last 25 years is happening 25 years is happened 25 years is happening.
The permanentire adapted in the room.
Like you see, it comes out of dark blue.
That's the journey ice ice ice ice ice ice of the winter.
And the crimpt in the six.
The so-called permanentire ics, five years or parent, is almost like blood that from the body slows out of the body is slowing here.
In 25 years is the way to this this to this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen the Northern Icell and there are a very big amount of front of front of front of front of microcks of microbbs are meth, when it deservicicrobes in mething,
First of the totaltal amount of the amount of the atmosphere, that could be display that could be requires as we connect the engineering point to surprising the atmosphere.
In some ondippeak in Alaska borrely methane of the water.
And last winter Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of Alaska with another team to another ondie.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is echer or we will be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be right.
A reason for there, is that this huge of Greenland of Greenland from the now-from the nothing,
This is a smell twaterriver of it.
The watervolume is echer than eye it is a greater than it.
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea lot of sea because it turns out because it turns out that is the place where it is the place where it is the sea place where it comes out of the sea in the sea cumultiple of the sea of sea is the sea of sea is the sea of sea is the place in the sea is the place where the sea is the sea is the place where the sea place where it comes in the
These stroming these stroms.
On the other side of the planets, on the South Pole, becomes the largest smass smasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasmasing the planet, on Earth.
And the maand rapported, scientists that the continent now is a negative ice sbalance.
More specific is the ice in the west, of the South Pool very quickly to the squicks, with name of the watereilands.
The whole continent to six meter seespeak for six meters, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two size massa, there are now new marks, which are now a couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drinks.
In the Andes, this is this glester the source of drink-water for this city of drinking this city of the Andes,
There are more stroroys.
But when they disappearing it is the drinkately water.
In California was a reminder of 40 percent in the snow-snowed Sierra.
It's really in the waterroror in the water reservoics.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global threatened to a behavic style of foot fuel of fuel fuel
And the number of nature's running all over the world is speaking a incredible and never seen seen in the world.
Four time in the last 30 years than the last 30 years than the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping one.
If you look at a historic context of a historic contexty, you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 24 million tons of CO2 24 hours.
25 miles every day in every day in our oceans, Keat the eye area of the Stille of the Stille of America, and then from America, and every single of America, and every single of the Indian subsistic of the oceans.
The only big cause of the major of the Earth, is the nature of the Earth, which is the destroy of pictures of fossil fuel fuels.
Olie is a problem, and stepping is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest challenges with China.
And there was a lot more city, to build a lot more cities of cities to build a lot more city.
But we see a commic.
These are the steenk-carbon which the bultions of the bultions of the past years, and green alternatives were alternatives were amazing the cirnations.
There is echer a political streedge of the glow-in our country.
The steenks, and oil industry gave years of the cools of 250 million dollars from the whether stepping cool to promotion, which is a connection of the connection is a connection of the cities.
And that picture of me thinking about something thinking about something thinking about something like this.
Round the guy was in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally city.
You probably seen the news in the news of the news
This is the one size size in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adversing of the steenkes of the stead of the stead of the stead of the Cerstroke.

He's paid and scate, and it's working their bat."
Here is a big particular particular particular Virginia of Virginia of day.
The greatest most most of the country is the great blayer of Massey Coal.

First is not smart.
We find that the scone, and it is -- and it still left.
So, you don't make a carry about climate change.
Let me just about us to be survive.
Video: Acteur: Schone steenks, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern scale scone of scale.
Fantastic. The machines make machines make the machines are very single of lay.
But that's the sound of scone of scone cools technology.
Dananks the fact that the focus of stepping the most important of the most important of the Earth is the main the Earth, the changes of the Earth, the ship of the Earth, the scene of the Earth's cools that you see here.
Look ook a good around the scone of cools of today.

We have to go far far far and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Forig year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reflected back to a update about how that machine works.
So here I am now, I don't get the one that there is the greatest scientific experiment is the greatest scientific experiment ever environment, 27 miles in the environment.
It has to the engineering the engineering that were less than a billions of the second nice ice after the universe is that the universe to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, d!
This is the machine Gene:
We took pictures of those less less of that less less in detectors in detectors of the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters -- 44 meters of the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the scale.
At 10 years of shaping the machine for the first thing to do we first front of the first time.
This picture was called ATLATLAS.
And that carried to a partnership in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particle that is a picture of the LHC gars that all around the LHC good, and with a piece of the LHC, valvalued with a piece of the LHC, where they were working in the detector of the LHC,
And in other words, when we saw the photograph 10 September we knew that the machine is a huge go.
I don't know if this is the greatest crowhether this is when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet pages.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact of the scientific impact that we have made a scientific impact that we have made a scientific impact that we have made a cultural as a scientific impact that means we have made a a scientific impact that we have a cultural as a a scientific impact of
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make these golden behaviors.
And they were 13 thousand of circle of cats when the machine on follow-foot craped up the machine on the entire power of the power of the power of fires of calls ago.
The engineers will say, "No value you, "No valu."
They can do that because they are superaturs in all the lage temperaturs.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be behaviors that are behaving the behaviors that are behaviors that are behaviors that are behaviors can be affected the behavis that are behaviors that are behaving the behavis that are behaviors that are behavior.
In one of the connection between the neine of the neine magnets in the LHC, was a construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction between the nees in the LHC, sat a construction of the construction of the constructive.
And it was wireless something warmer, and there was intended to that 13 thousand of that 13 thousand of camps.
This was the outcome.
This is still ins-crow-cking you that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the 20 tons of the past 30 centimeter were about 30 centimeter were about 30 centimeters.
We had about 50 monkets about 50 monkes.
We had to them out out of them out, what we did it.
We all were high-pared parent.
Now they're back to weather.
Eind mics will be the LHC againtacks.
We'll expect it and we expect it in juni or right or right or right or right and we can go to the challenges of the universe of the universe of the universe are building the universe are building the universe.
Now, of course, the course, have been insound the debate of scientific research. It's easy to research. It's easy. It's easy.
I think it's the fact that it's so hard, the fact that we go to be further than the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphysics, destroy Davy, I think the destate of the value of the value of his teachership of his teachers, his teachership Farad, "Nonce said, "Davy, Nthing that our images of the human mind that our images of science we have have no mysterions of the world.
Thank you very much.
I would like to ask you to ask you back to your kids to go to your kids when you played with blocks.
When you discovered how to gray the food, they were going to be problems to the teaching up and the deal with the teaching and dependent of space and hands of space relations.
Ruface is a strong is a strong of the world to understand the world.
If an informatic, inspired by the nest of physical interaction with objects -- and with the objects -- and with my advise and my advise of the Calanii -- what we could be able to ask me -- what we could use a computer -- what we could use a computer of the vingerate vings that could be a digm that could be able to be a clay individuce with the plans of the conconconfitation with the re-flects of information with the influence of information with with with with the information with the
and as we want to be ordering on?
These question of us so so that we decided to be a answer to figure out of Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftable computer is a interactive computer size a cooks.
They can be able to be able to be able to detect their movement, their movements and they care and they free a screen and they are contact.
The guy is the physical handely, just like blocks like blocks can be replaced by gray it.
Boven-dislide tables a example, a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
Thirds these help-aid teaching a more physical different, and are of their movements and each other, and even of the way we move them are different and read interactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is instoned a video to tell you that it through the case and others played and others are playing, and otherwise played to be played to be playing.
These interactive portraits of the interaction of each other.
Indians are going to put together, they will be able to each other.
If they are ringly engineering this and they can be seen this and become some single and become support.
And they feel them movement and doing.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction, the use of these interaction, the use of the interaction, as it chemickly as it was a fluid like a flow-like a foot as it was a list like a list of foot as it was a list of the interaction,
In this example, three Siftables care mings to and I can use them to go to a little bit of a lege in a lege of good, where they are they become front of the forward.
If we have governments we go back to what we go back back to the back back back to the time.
There are some of crapy capability for the education, especially playing, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to be able to be able to promountain the outcome, and the outcome, and the outside.
Here I -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple response of a simple programatic programmatic programmatic programmmate.
Here we show a game that is a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every round a willling literally in every Siftable, and then the cirmultions are controllling in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and differently and difference, and it is a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm going to try and I'm going to try to make them out to try to make them out and make a video of video of them and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these action is that people needed is that people needed instructions of these access.
All you have to say "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the tests.
That's our young both byta tester, right?
But, he looks like the Siftables wrote the Siftables wrote
For him this only blocks.
Here is a interaction of painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for temporal language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carracters in the scene, just by the Siftable with that carakters of the table.
Here he shows the sun up.
Video: The son comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area of tracky area.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed thought, "Yeah! Yeah!
By the scue of Siftables and the nearly places and the nearly -- and then they can response with each other, War -- Video: War the carakters.
DM: and so his own story tell his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end of a open end of a open end.
and he decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example, I will show show Is a synthesizer and live music is that we developed recent recent to develop a sound product like the lead, basic product like the lead, basic.
Eengineer, has four different variations, you want to use what you want.
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected to be injected the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern of the sounds.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the pattern of a likely Siftable effects like reverb and movable effects like reverb and filter.
They're going to be a sound and attened by changing and device.
And the general effects like tempo and volume and volume that are device on the whole pattern on the whole pattern of pattern on the gars.
Let's look at it.
Video: D: We start with a lead in two Siftables, to a first patroon, to a first patroon, lost of a slides of a circle.
Now I want to be the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: D: Now I feed what I feed to do it.
Video: And now I copy the movie on the filter of the filter of the foot of the front of the foods.
Video: I can be the gets of the declics of the tempo blocks.
Video: D: Now I get the movie of the foot of the bas a little more expression.
Video: I can rescrow the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to plann, but I can provision improvise and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and shorter as I want to be able to plann.
And finally, the animals of the dimms of the volume Siftable to the volume Siftable to the slides.
Thank you.
Like you can see, my passion from the passion, to make new peop-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and working together.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design design area with some of elections that we develop the developing we develop the developing in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about is that this is just the attace is to a very new generation of the interacting with digital media to the interacters, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from harte.
I look at it out to you all to you all to you all to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to all of you to talk to you to all of you to talk to you with all of you all to talk to you to talk to you all to you.
I'm writing.
Books write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life is a long life I decided and I don't think that will ever change that will ever change that will change.
And it is something like that, there is something like my life and career in my life and career and career with my relationship with my work on my work on my work on the work on my work on the time.
It started with a book that I have been writing the gars of a memoire: "Extom, Bidd," which is very in my first work, and a international working the whole world about and an international existence.
The sequence, people are all all and always focused to be told me as if I do do it.
And the thing -- getting go!
People come to me and questions, "Ben you don't have to be able to equipy that you can't evenar?
Do you don't afafid you are going to be able to write the written will never be a book that people will be a book people to get to the case in the write of the people will be going to be able to write your entire life will be write to be a book of the people will be able to write the entire life will be write a book
Do you don't have a job?"
Erunnerd, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very be. But I remember 20 years ago, I was remember 20 years ago, when I was told that I was told that I was writer -- I was write to be write that I was write to be write that I was write to be a destroyed about 20 years ago.
People said, "Do you don't have that you never get succes?
Do you don't afford to deal with the support of such such in sugge?
Do you don't afafid you live on this work, you have a lot of working out that there is something from the puin of your buildings on the puin of your buildings with your buildings with your mouth of fal?"
Something in that stream.
In the short comes to ask this notice is to ask this notice is to this novely on this now."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough to be enough.
Also, all of time.
But I'm also a lot of other things band, you want to know what is to do for all of the things that all of the other things.
For instance, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is write write to ask myself the last time to the last time that are from.
Is the ration?
Is it the logical that somebody is a bad for the work for the work for the working on Earth are on Earth are going to be on Earth are the logical that someone are going to be the working on Earth,
What is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the mindses, something that is something that is something that you don't happen to do anything that is not happen.
Take my father. He was scaled engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was working on him that he was worked on him or it was not afraid or it was a job.
And so that is "Yohn, how is it with your chemistrack?"
No, so it was not about it.
To be fair to be: score engineers have been taking the century of the century of the century of the manic-depresent depresent coholists are depresent coholists are depresent coholists are the cooks.
Scheing what we have these kind of reputation.
Not only writers have been able to be the reputable, the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the people.
Look at the grim of the death left-destate death creative gets of the 20th century.
Many stiered young, often by own across own across own across own across own across the world.
And even those of those who didn't have suicians seem to be such their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be suiciod.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meat every book is a piece of myself is a piece of mitself."
That's notice what to say to say about your lifes.
But of these kinds of explaining this kind of challenge.
We all heard the first ones and have heard the first of them and accepted it with my and accept.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is that a artistate of the list is going to be able to read to read to cellended to cellend.
So why I want to ask everyone here today: Do you to ask that idea is the idea of living the idea of living the idea of life?
Do you think OK?
Because I think about it think, I think about it now, I think it's not a pretty much thought.
I think it's the weather swking.
And also even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this this century is so good.
We can creative gets a lot more more than a lot more than to live.
I know sure that it would be able to me, in my situation, without dangerously, to be able to live.
Seker the fase in the fase of my career now is now now in my career now.
Go now, I'm still young, amper vehicle.
I can be four decades in the decades.
And the Hoostyle is going to be what I published the outside of the world as the work that is the working on that outside of the work.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can be well-sing: hope is probably the most of success,
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think about it is going to be able to you know the morning, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So I don't want to be not.
I love me to be working with the work I love the work I love the work I love the work of the work.
The question is, "Do you ask it?"
After for the conclusion of the conclusion I can only go with written if I can just write a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write the write of a securient destate between mirries and my government to the reactions, and my dead audiences on my future.
I have seen the last year, I went to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of history and have been doing me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others to help or others to help people to help with the emotional complications of the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been building me to the old Green and Romenon and Romenon and Romenon and Romeno.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Green and Romeneness people who didn't believed that creativity was of themselvity of themselvity of themselvity of the old Green Romens."
Men believed that creativity was a godddling of a dispentable place, that creativity to the ments of the ments of the people.
The Green who call these circle of creativity "demons of creativity """"demons."
And the thing Socrates believed that he had a demoon that he was influistered him in the words of the words of influisters.
The Romenening a species of species of the Romenening idea.
And if you have a connections of a nine-creative me."
The grappy is that the Romenening with a genius is not a genius to be a genile.
In their police was a genius was a genius of magic goddling the murs of the artic of the artist.
A little bit like Dobso-f.
If the artists was the working called the genassistentic.
And he gave it was working on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the way I talked about the first of had, the psychological protection to the outcomes of your work.
Everybody knew how it is working in his work.
The artists was so in protection called called called cism.
If you were brilliant worth is not the eer.
Everybody knows that a invisible, that a inslides.
With you work on the work, then you get to you.
Everybody knew that you have a nogal independent genii.
Lange time is that the Wests creativity was protected to the Wests creativity was described
When the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual ment, the individual ments is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
Go space for mystical weather, including from the goddly.
And that was the beginning of the rational housing househ.
People believity that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first thing in the history was about artists said that they were a geniius and not that they were a genion.
I have to say that I think I think I think that I think I think that I think
To one person, one single individual individual is that he or they whether it is the sourcer of the century of the century of the century of all of what godddling the device of the century of the century human psychche.
Also, or somebody asks the skey sketching the sket.
Ego's become up to gigantic proportion and there are imprestatientiables and there are imprestations of prestating.
And I think this present 500 years of artists has been made a lot of artists of artists --
If that is, and I think is the question is, "What do is the question is, "What do is the question?
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old back, on a old relationship of the relationship between the ments and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
We can take 500 years of rational humanism not undesperate in a 18 minutes of speeching speech.
And the course of the audience of people who are the scientific scientific two-foot scientific reaching the idea that elfights with what facts of parts to inspiring the working artions to inspiring up to inspiring up with the foot of the work.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you to get you in there,
And I ask it to me.
Why issue right?
Why would we don't have that thought not to get to the next on?
It is just so much hit as much hirs like all the other explains of the totally improved uncted in the creative process.
Everybody who has something something has to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so it -- you know, the creative process is not always rationally rationally rationally, not always rations.
And it takes almost paranorally, it feeling in the paranormals.
I have the great American animal American animal American Ruth Stone of the American answer of the American ance.
She's seen in the neintive. Her all of life already write they did.
She told me about her yourself on the plattle of Virginia.
Some on the following it was working on the work, she was a dish of the country.
It was so she said, "Well, if there was a big golf air.
And it was closer golfed than the country to her country to her country to her it.
They feel that the ground: the ground: the ground: Se: her on that moment but one thing to do to do it for her life.
They rough, they were running up to the followed and they had to be able to get out and paper and paper seeing and paper than it to set it out of the paper than it to set it and they had to squickly soon as quickly squickly to square fast to squickly set them out to set up the house and they
When it was seen by her hundred was that her only chance her only to write it to write it on the write.
Sometimes they didn't have seen enough.
Then and ringing them them sing, but reaching it home.
And in the such moments to her her him -- in her him, in the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another dichicken -- to another dichicken -- to another dichicken -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in
And it was a lot of them -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are the close to be the dised of the story -- they were the deal of the story --
Then she was seen in house and paper and paper, and it became up through her him and it was closing her him.
Juist at that moment she had a potately good.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she pluked it out of the air.
She got the close to his strank and it back back in her body while she was the squarking.
In those cases the close to be seen that in my mind, but then in my paper in the paper of paper followed following up in the environment.
When I think that I think -- what I think -- what is so far to be a creative process.
And it works my creative proces! I'm not a medium! I don't me!
I'm a mouse of a mouse of the same time, every day on the same time, and then it up with blood, and then transforms and then transform and then transforming them and then transforming them on the same time.
But even in that day's swhed I have been a experience of experience.
You will also know it also knowledge, that sense of creative ideas in your relationship from a source of a source you can identify impossible.
What is that then is that fun for fun to bring fun for fun of fun is that fun for fun of fun that is that food?
How can we use it without that we get it without the right?
At a way that good for us to is?
The best contemporaine that I can think is musician's musician Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while.
We had it government about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life life is the showed of the mind of the connections that are trying to get to get to get to the impulsable creative impulsable creative impulsable creative impulsable creative impulsable creative impulsable to get to get out of the well-up in the instanstance,
And the ''d Tom what ruster is rustant
And it was reached in Los Angeles of the freet, and changed the process of the process.
And while he heard there was a fragmental of a melodie.
The decide, as that is the inspiration that is going, indepengue -- wellend.
It was a nice melose and he wanted to fash.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no pap, no table.
The whately known to the spanning back to the melose of the melotic of the melotic remains the century of the century behind me up.
I'm not good enough, I cannot be right."
He didn't get to the pay in panick, but he stop that all of mental process.
He looked up, hope to the air, and said, "Sorry heard that I don't see that I would be seen it up?"
"Do you really write that I can write a song?
If you really want to come out that this lose is going to be later later when I have time for you have.
And not, somebody else else are fall.
Ga buurts with Leonard Cohen." And from that moment the process is losing the process of the process.
And the work is the same thing with the best known dge of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the d
But the sware spanning the creative process in him of him reflected the geniius of the geniiion.
The geniy set it takes and levering it only sheep and reversing up.
And so that there was no reason there was to go to go.
It could be a wonderful wonder, bizar, bizar, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner's aspect that not help from Tom myself.
That story has changed my way of work.
I have been profit of profishing from it.
I was in the middle in the middle of Ets, Biddom.
I have given a moment I in wants in want,
You know that you want to work and you don't want to be good and you think it is a terrible ramp of the book book.
Not set set up the bad is really bad bad bad bad it.
I wanted to do the whole project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project.
When I remember Tom who who who who who who was going to be genile, and I decided to be a posed to be a posed to be a posed to be a posed to be a posed to be a posed to be a posed
I knew I knew me from my manuscrips and directly to a lege cording to a lege corner of the room.
And I said hardoping heard, we know that if we know that if this book is not just brilliant is not only by me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in what I have in me.
And I can't give you to give it.
If you find that it is better than you have to be able to come to do you get to come to do.
Snap you don't do that, you don't want you to you, yourself
I just write because that's one of my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are going to be able to be able to be able to be differently.
Tja--- Uital comes here to take it here --
Every wen ago, there were in the North African wood African woostine people to despending to maanlient to dancing the music.
And the hours and hours, to the morning, to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But some of some of echeter something for it.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen with that, you ever seen something that is in a performer.
It was like the time to stilistood and the dancer by a poor,
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now now now now the shaps.
Plocation is not just a human beings just a ment.
In him, all the him flows him him him him.
A godn’t defined him.
If something called the thing thing happened to happen, people what it was Dan you start clah, all the way to clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was to do.
By historic fact, a fun historic fact, when the Mors Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu
The outcome, echer by the century hits changed of "Allah."
And you hear the day today.
If a artists in Spanu or magically or magically, it is going to be able to be oil one, "Allah, right, well, Allah, great."
Our understand it, is a glimp of God.
Preciiping what we need to have to have to do.
Lastig is echer that the dance is the next morning to the morning, it was discovered on dinary the morning, to be a goddddly.
And at that moment he is a what parents of parents that will never be able to be able to be such a little bit of the well-such of parents will come to be able to come to be able to come up with the parents of the parents of parents that will come up to be a little bit of the
Maybe there will never be someone else God will be a little bit of the things are dancing
What is to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really really hard to sell a creative mind.
But so that is that needed to be not to be to be now.
Imagine that you don't have the most unusual aspects of your person of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your
And if you believe that you believe that you have a time to be a while,
When you are ready with it, they are going to be somebody else else.
And it allows all the way to everything.
I do invitial that I think of the dad of the dad of the average
The last months I have been working on a book, that will be differently will be differently. It's a lot of a lot of restore to be challenges.
The follower of that illuster progress.
If my thoughts with me to the hall, I keep the same thing I still like the same and, I don't know the same thing. See don't have any of it.
Do just you work.
For just you do this, what it is.
If you are task it is to thank you.
If the goddling that you is the godddling to be able to make a time of the wonderful source of the wonderful sourcing with the wonderful sources, then "Olat!"
Geventually, not, thank you in the thank you.
And also "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe
"Olen!" ""how ook, because we get from pursuing human love and properties of the foot of the foot of the flows.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
You know, I have had been talking about a couple of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digital issue to the digital code to a new fase in the biology to go to a new fase in the biology and synthetling the designs of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living is something that I think is something that I think about a lot of biolos to understand in different level of the level level of the lives.
We tried to be tried to less approaching the way to less components.
We're now almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years of the digitize
When we have the human genome we have sequence, it was from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask the question: we can create life or we create needed to be needed to make new life from this digital universe is to be able to be able to ask life in this digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe is we create nee---asily to ask life
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitself to a kind of the such of that can be able to a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of the map of the map of a little organized of the map of a smallest genitaliu
And we have tried to look at a nice or we can come to a nice for a little bit of genome genome of genome genome of genome genome of genome genome of genome of the genome.
We can be in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so,
But if we look at the metabolical ma, is relatively simply considered the unso.
Gelf me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at a piece of single that would be very unliving cell that would be a living cell cell that would be a living cell that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a piece of the genes we can be a living cell of the genes we can be a living cell cell c
We decided to be the only rously, the only rously, to synthetism this chromosing components to synthetissues to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we start asking questions, "Can we start asking a chromosing?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very large molecules that we never seen before?
And if we do that, if we do that, a chromosopm "rest?
A chromosopm is just a piece of chemical including material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitize of the digitial evidence.
Our ability to write the genetic code lose of song nogal slowly slowly across the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code code the
And our last point it would put on this moment in a exponential curve.
We're going to start with her.
There were some city for a city of city for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult of DNA is really difficult that the synthese.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making 30 to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so much of how long you make it pieces of the world, so more far you make it pieces of the world, how more follow.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and the corrigerate of all the front of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start to start to understand the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small four rus that bacteria tiny so.
We designed the study, we did the study, the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters of about 5,000 letters
It was going to be able to be a little bit of the chemical stine in the bacteria -- and the bacteria and the bacteria and virtural code of the genetic code, and virtual particles are making the genetic code of galls and virtural particles are going to be able to be the bacteria --
The virral particles were when local particles were going to be cells, they came back and then they came back and deaths the E.
I was unfortune with the oil industry, and I said that they said that model but I said that that model but all of them to well.
They laught more than you lot.
So we think this is a situation is a situation in which the software are actually building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of greater great.
We wanted to build the full bacteria chromoses.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettor of viruses, so we could actually put the cassettch the cassettes --
to understand what the device is the work-connected components of a living cell.
The design, and if you start to digital information in the computer than digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than to be very accure.
When we first first this genome for the first time this was the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of one front of one front of the spire of the standard-a-based partners.
And then we found the resequencing about 30 pours of 30 olds of the original sequencing sequence.
And the design of the designs of the designs of design that are 50 letters are 50 letters that have to be able to build the other stuck of 50 letters to build these little sub-simply sub-simply to build them together to build them together to build them together to build them together to build them together to design and the device that we have to build
We design design here until in the spiring here.
Maybe you might have a lot of water markicks.
Beach, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G.
Trios of those letters costs for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attace of the aminoxygen of every aminoxygen of the aminoxygen of the aminoxygen of the pursuing coax-coasts of those of those letters of those letters of those of those of those of those of those of
So we can use the genetic code to write words, you know, they thought.
And we have a signnership just just a lot of them.
Some of the teleurged that there were no dished.
We have these pieces so we can eat them with enzyms.
There are some of some of them are reparents and they were able to do together.
And we start to make pieces of these pieces of pieces that are five to 7,000 letters of the pas they were able to each other, and you have 24,000 letter, and you have 24,000 letter, to 7240.
In every city catch we could set a government of these stuck stuff because we could sequences that is a process of creating that is very robuying you see the very robuying you -- that will see you see the very robuying you see the straks.
We try to get the point of automatishing the point of automatics
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
Like we come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparts -- they don't grow it so easy more in E.
That is the most of the modern of all modern tools of the modern biology.
So we went to raise to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe response of reparently that is used by biology to reparers, that challenge of the DNA can foot the cassums.
Here is a example of it.
There is a organized Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radied on the side.
And you see that in the front panely, my chromosopm just just out of the other.
12 ot 24 hours later sections like the ones of the another, exactly like the first of the first time.
There are thousands of organizing organs that are.
These organizes can be followed to be follows.
They can live in a vacuum,
I know absolutely sure that there is life in space, it can move forward, a new aquatic environmental environmental environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of course, there is a lot of it.
Here is a device microphotograph of the molecule that we have made with these processes -- actually with this processes with the right design.
And it is a cardic society.
This is no electron-microscope photograph. This is a wire microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience, we went out out to explain the audience.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule ever made by people, with a duce of people, with a duce structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 millions of them.
If we would describe the 10-point letter, without spations, without spatiations, then it only to the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the dependent of the genetic code of the point of points of the genetic point of the
Good how do we started, how do we started?
It's a four-frus is the clearly nogal easy.
And it is a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like euck and it is just the celkers out of the celkers and do another in, and that's what you know if it klone.
By the bacteria species of the chromosing in the cell, but we have inseen the cell, but we have to show that we have a complete transplaboration of a chromosople can invitial transplabs to another other, and it actives.
We have a chromosople south of a micromosing species.
These are about so far from each otherwise and muizes.
We food what extra genes so we could select for this chromosing chromosing the chromosing.
We have the conted, we have the enzyms to make all the profound.
It was woman was very sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced images here -- the new chromosophic images in the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to come to come out to the process of the process of them to develop the process of developing the process.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosphers or a thousands of daan, where they were thousands of chromosphere in one of the species of the species of the species.
People who are evolving evolved, if there are not a lot of biology has not a lot of biology in the way of the environment.
There are enzyms that restricti-enzyms are enoughly enough,
It chromosing that in the cell was not easy it.
The cell -- the chromosphere, which we stop -- which is going to stop -- which is going to stop it.
It was expressing, and it reknowledge the other chromospher, and it was so that we had the cell of the cell with the new chromoses.
He was blue to the genes that we had stop the genes that we stop in the genes that we had stop it.
And in very short time and all the carakistics of the one species, and changed the species of the species, and it completely in the new software that we had stop in the cell we had stop the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell time.
All the golden changes, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was changing the genetic code in which it was changed.
This is a genomics like genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundament.
Good, I have been paid that this is not a scaling -- this is not a scaling of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have a paid of a new species of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrbrical explosion of the Cambrical new species of cambrane new species of design.
Why would you do it?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what it is to what is needed is to what is needed is to what it is.
We're going to be inside of six-a-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my contex, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us that in 1946, in 1940, in 1940 years that there are four four.
We have to food with food food of the food of scale, medicine, fuel of the ses-a-half billion.
That's really really really to do that for neine to do that for neine to do that for nex.
We use five billion tons of collapsing vats of vates.
That's 100 milos of vices a day.
When we take biological processes in ogenic processes or or what process is to replace; then it is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, there is all the carbon dioxide of the state that in the atmosphere.
And in all our worldwhether we have to have a databa-million genes, and that I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronics industry of industry components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity of the electronicas.
We are predictions by a biological reality and our example.
We don't have technique technique synthesemethods to be so-called combination genomics called combination genomics to do it.
We've got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million genes of the deal to optimalizing octons to make octon or medicine or medicine or medicine with a small team of the tam of team -- we can chance with a small team of the science.
And it's just standard selective.
We can select select for lives, chemical or fuel of fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen image of what real designer design, so you can work to work, so you can really get to the gang and a new species of the computer and a new species of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what real design.
We don't know how it will see what it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code from disease.
We four fourth generation fuel el like fourth generation of fuel --
Our good, you know, you fine to ethanol of the anol experiment.
We have second and third generation is fuel that will come out out of the sugars are going to come out of the fuel fuel like octon or of different types of butano.
But the only way we think that biology is great influence without the food needed the food and the describes and the describes are the food as we start with CO2 as his food as his food as his food as his food and we think we think we think we think we think we are going to think we think we are the first generation of the first generation and we do the first generation of them in about 18 months to have to have a lot of food.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwrite our worldwalling the discoveries of other methods of other methods of other methods of the world.
This is a organized that we have described in 1996.
It gives in the deepic, about 2.5 miles deep, to temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecules.
We're looking at the same or we can take CO2 2, which is easy four, which can be able to fabries to fabries to fable, where that CO2 fuel to brandstom, to stop this process.
So in a short time we think we are in the basic question: "What is living to the basal question: "What is living the base life?"
We have works, you know, you know, the describe the petrochemical industry industry industry industry industry of the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this in TED -- where then you can do it in TED
A important energy source of energy sources.
But we are also using these working tural carbs to be front of circines vaccines of vaccines of these works.
This year was the griculture, we always always like the facts of the facts of the facts of the vaccine.
I think that can change that changing by textom, combined vaccines of texting.
Here you see how the future is going to see the evolution, the evolution, the evolution mous, the translate with synthetic bacteria and inventually eukaryota.
We're still far away of the people.
Our goal is certainly to stop a chance of chance enough to survive that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you if you want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we put in a new technology that we put in a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in you local or at the distance of the amounts of the amounts of data can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can be here to be able to be on the coopers and exception and the sorts and the sorts to our ws.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look how big this collections or images or images are images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images of these collections or images.
Most of these are normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 meapixle of the 300 meapixle meapixle of the 300 meapixel of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library
It's all of nothing that it would be able to be the prestats would be influence in a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, a completely book, a completely book,
This is the grain in the gray house is a headd-collabor.
To evidence that it is really text, and not a imagine, we can do something that we do something that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is this a little bit strange way to read.
I wouldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to them.
This is a realistic, this is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a deal.
This is really gives you the place and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or crows, or calling a scaling medium is.
We also have something done something with the corner of these challenge of The Guardian.
We have a nice of advance-resolution -- many higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of the inside of the way of adverss.
If you want to see the possibilities of these car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make the constitutions of treating the screen of hands through the screen in the screen of the screen to do the screen
We hope that this is no pop-ups more means and other third flaul -- not needed to be more than it will be needed to be more meaningful flaul -- not need to be more meanings and other third that it is more means and other thirflaul -- not nee-flaw-co-co-co-w-up fee-flaul -- not nee-flaul -- not new-h.
Of course, a lot of agriculture, is a technology of the technology as a technology like this, I will be a time to play here, except that we have a lot of this follow.
These are all the layer in the U.S.
And the farm on a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, you can see the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques together.
One of course Seadragon and the other is a very nice of computer vision research of the University of Washington Washington, aaah Seitzy on University on University on University on University on University on University on University on University of Washington and the University of the University of the University of the University of
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A nice collaboration.
So this is the lives on the Web. It's meant to Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this -- you see that we see the images and the multi-resolution experience.
The space shaping of the images has this meaning is her.
The computer vision of the vision of these images have built together, so they are algoriths of the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canade's Canades -- where they are are taking these things are going to be able diashowhether these things are pitched space or pictures, and all these things are space him him of the vision.
I don't know sure or there is another time is, other environments to show you.
There are many space that are many space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynthese, we worked that we worked to this summer -- to communicate the worky of these environmental section of these techniquicires on our website.
We had to know how to do the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notral Dame with the Notre Dame with Flickr. You just seeing Notre in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs a picture of imagination that was part of this model of this model of this model of model of this model of this model of the orange of these orange challenges that are part of this model of this model of this model of the orange choices.
And so these are all Flickr images are all the way of space in this way of space in the way of space.
And we can focus on simple them to fignore them
You know, I never thought I had ever thought I never thought I would have ever been working at Microsoft
It's overwhelse here is so under to be so far.
I believe you can see that this many types of types of gsm to spirirls of girl-flexcamera -- a great couple of them in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange what strange images
There are so many works by face and third it and thir.
Erying this between this is even a series of photographs -- here are here.
This is a poster of the Notral Dame that is churing churing the program.
If we put four four, in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say to say is that we can do with the social environment, this is the data -- from the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entire collective and copy the Earth is -- and coppacks that everything to be the each other.
All these pictures are photographs are a very little bit more greater than the som of the square of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth is going to be a model that from the whole Earth
And this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual A.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it uses the use, and it will be growing the people who are used to the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to use the people who used to the people who used to the people who used to the people who used to use the people who used to be used to the people who are used to the people who used to use the people who are used to the people who growth the people who are growth the people who used to use the people who are used of the people who are used to use the people who grow the people who the prepredictions of the cked.
Their own pictures are going to be able to be somebody else in the front of the metaper of metape of metap-photographs are inved.
If somebody would like to be able to get their names, and their names, and their names, and then my picture of the Notral Dame is rich of the Notral Dame that we can use it as a access, and create that metape that metape of every photos, and created these kind of crucidential social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social social experiencs.
And of course, it's the particular product of this imments of a imments of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only from aircks, which is not only from aircrapiding images and other across the collective images and other across the collective images and devices.
Our told thank you thank you.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you can do software possible, in the next years, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are dead by everyone on the world.
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered is discovering
It create, to your wish, hyperlinks between imagines.
And it does that based on the data in the data in the imagine.
And that's going to be device when you think about the rich of the rich of semantic information that many of these images of semantic information that many of these images of these images of these images of the imagines of these images of imagines that are describes of these images of semantic information that many of these images of semantic information that is describeduring of these images of semantic information that is going to be of these imaimages of semantititions of semantions of semantic information that is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is of the imaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimagingingingintions of the tentititititions of
When you go to imagine the web and you far a search of a seeing in the web.
What if you are that image of imagination is to all your images of your imagination?
Then semantic semantic connections and the amount of rich that comes out of the gigantitic networks that comes out of the networkers effect. It's a classical networkers effect.

Maybe you can see paralls with information from other brones.
And I also tried to explain some of the connections you can be mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be: the official dogma of dogma of destrong, industrialized society.
And that official dogma air like follow: Om the well-foot gest level of our neighbors on the highest level of them as much as possible individual frerequivalue of free free of the free of the free of the free of our citizens
Freedom is a big good, a big good, a big good, a big part of the human exist.
Boven-free to be able to treat its own insent to own insent to be a higher which is a higher without inments of them.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicicians.
More choices in that people are freedodom in that people are freedodo.
And more freedom means automatically more well.
This is so diep in our society that no one would be somebody to be able to device that no one would be able to be able to device in our society.
And in our lives life is this dogma step of city.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choicics.
This is my supermarks. It's a middle great.
Even about threat.

So that's the ath of my supermarks.
Look at electronics wins. You can be able to strong-stroy -- luiding cassettesp, cassettespier, radio strong.
And in that one electronics you can cookle you can cookicks.
You can be seen set six million different systems together, with parts of these store.
Give -- then you have a lot of choic.
Something example, communication.
When I was young yet, you could all be phones you have been asking phones to ask Ma Bell.
You don't focus on the fun it up. You couldn't be it.
That was the way the present of the connection that it never stuff.
That time is the time.

The sequenc: people come to the winke, and strongs these question.
And you know how to ask the answer to the question of the question
No one.
It's not possible to buy a lot of buy that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of the life that are more importantly, the attention of playing the attacks, this explosive is a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact of choices that are more importantly.
Gealth carryshealth -- it's in the U.S. inequality is not that you go to the doctors you what you have to do you have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do or we can do do you do it or we can do do you do it or we can do you do it --
Actually, and took these ances.
By this predictles, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dok, you say, "Dok, what is find find is what finds are going to be like this.
And the doctor, "Actually, this and, and then you have this present -- and then we took these ances.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you say, "Do you do me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you say."
And we call "own inside of the patien."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, it means that the sware of the decision of someone with someone with someone with a residestate of the death, somebody who are free the decades of the condition to take a lot of conditions -- the patients of the recepipatients.
Good described that nership because the deat, you know, you can buy them and I don't copy them can not buy them.
Why do do if we don't do them to buy them to buy them to copy them to copy them to copy the copy reclade?
Because they think that we think we think we are the next morning, our deaths to ask that other market gene-aver.
Our identity, right, a ingree-finging aspect of us existence, now as you can seeing on this dia sea-choices like this slides.
Our identities of our background.
We are like that, we often want to be so often to be able to them.
Everybody else to the surface you have to think what to be thinking about person you want to be thinking about person you want to be able to be thinking about what to person you want to be thinking about what to person you want to be able to be thinking about the surface of the morning.
Let's talk about the househome of the househ.
There is a time that freedom that free everybody looks like to be able to be able to be able to kids and then as well.
The only choice was with well, not when and you did not when and you deal with it.
Now free everything for the surface everything for it.
I feel like to be intelligent students, which I think I twintive percent of houssing up than hous' houssing the shaps.
They are not the heaver than living in early than asked in the earlier.
No, they have the choices with choices make choices.
"Sell I trust or not? Sell I do it?
Or will I wake up with that, or a care? Do I first kids, or a care?"
These are all the questions.
They go through them to have a answer to them to have a answer to be their housing work and it through their housing and it up with it it and then it doesn't have a good circle.
And they are important life. It's important living questions.
And then we come to work. Carl game just that technology to work every minute of every minute of every day -- except that technology of every day -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place that I love a place that I love love to the WiFi it does.
I don't wrong because I want to keep that place for mirry.
But good, that good, which is huge of works in that we still ask us to ask us to ask us to be working on time to be work, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalwood of our soon look at the one side, with our cell phone and our Blackberry on the other hand, and what light our laptop of our laptop of the laptop of our laptopic on the scooks.
And even if they all come out of the state, we all all the way that we are all the way to ask all of the question: "Do I asked this phone?
Do I go to this email, you know, all of these fuel write write of the fun of the fun of the email.
And even if the answer is the answer is experience we experience the footbalth of our soon on a very different way.
Where we look at at the great, the small, materialistic things are listy: life is a cross-single of cooks.
And it saw the world there was going to be used to be saw the world
There were some choices, but not everything was a croad.
And so the world looks like the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad w?
The answer is: "Yea."
We all know what is good at is good to be good about what is bad is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects of two effects on the ment.
It's a very connections is that the first thing is that it was working than the first of confreedom.
And so many choicicial possibilities of people to make a choic.
I give you a very dramatic example, a very behavior to invest investments in free-plans.
A colleague to invest investment in Vanguard, a big policy propersation society, a big police with about one million workers of about 2,000 cools about 2,000 vestments of 2,000 vestments of the 2,000 vestments of the circity of Vanguary,
They discovered that for every deal of every deal foundations that worked on the working on the working on the works.
Do fenough front founds. And then they were less than five than five than five founds. Why?
Because it was found-fircle founds.
And of course, from the challenges.
That means not only that that people after their pensionate to eat their pensionate because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they don't have the choice as wellenough, so that they have been so laster to have them to have it.
And they were going to be 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to go to 5,000 dollars a year to be 5,000 dollars a year to be 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a
The workers was a calculate to reach their own behavior.
So many choices can be working so much choicks.
And I think the world there is that the world that is so from it.
If it is to the century good, you want to be very found, you want to be the right choick?
You don't want to be sure to the wrong found, or even the wrong founds.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, if we were the lost of our descening and cooky and cooky less to the outcome, the entire of his result than it would be less to the outcome.
There are measurements for to feel and feel
One of that, there's one choice, for example, for example, they can be perfectly the choice of the choice of the choice was perfectly perfectly perfectly the perfect.

This is droom alternative carry-such carries to you get of your choice.
And it does it despiring the following of the choice of choice that you have made it was a good choic.
How more option, the more options are the way to have the way to have the consider of unair that election of the cost opers.
A second reason has to substitute costs.
Dan Gilbert gave morning, all of how often we dependent the value of the things that we are going to be able to do them on the things that we are going to be able to do them on the value of the things that we are going to be able to do the value of the things that we are going to be able to do the morning.
If you can indent, you can indent, you can intention, you can see the attracky the attraction that you can deal of all the alternatives you deal with the crapiding the front of the alternatives you can be soon the squickly quickly the attraction that you can be far the attracky of your many altern
That makes you feel less to the alternative that you have cooks.
A example. For New Yorkers under jull: My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a vice two-wing.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend Stralend of a ment.
Beter can be it? "Don't you thinking that men men who man, "It's augors.
Everybody in my busts in Manhattan is the city of the city is the city of the city
I could be my car, I could do the defring for the death of the death of the defr.
And he's seen two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking of the idea that he was a great parking parking a great parking parking place.
People taking the foot of the people, we have the following of our choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the front of our choice.
How more possibilities are the more possibilities are more than you are the engineering alternatives are.
And those presentation of us as substitutions.
One of an example.
This imagine story, this image of a points.
Like in the here, and now for example, and you have to survive things not to sure things that you have to be able to be able to survive.
And one point is that you have a point of choice other choice out.
And all of the other has so far, the cooky cookes the cooky cooking.
Ten the third is the escalation of expecially
I came up to this in the time, I went to a new bound.
I turn almost always play nearly played to be good.
Bger was a kind of play -- and one kind of the pigger, and it was the past totally unately uncomfortable, but if you don't believed the bounce: the book enough and often enough it front of the table.
After years I went to the winke, for a new-away.
I said, "Day, I want to play a spire of the w."
And the winkle said, "Wilt you slim -- easy fit or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed the windo?
Would you have a crit? Wilt you or a critic?
Would you have a bk with slutching slow?
Wilt you something like pile, or fles, or far shehe's, or far it was going to be so.
I was a little bit of the same. Na time said I said, "I want to say the only job that was the only bk that was going to be the only bk that was there.
He had no idea which was not a idea which was that was a hours of the enables of the enables are passions of the engineering
And then, I really, the whether is the winke, I remember the winks.
I had been better mind it in the body's possibilities I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself to myself to myself, I have a book,
The reason I don't feel better feeling with all of the choicic, that I was more expect of a good speak of a good speaker.
I started to be able to expect without only one kind of played in the time.
When there were different wars, and one of there, and one of there, and one of the front of the front of the front of there,
What I was cost was good, but not perfect.
So I reach my job with my job with my fightly, and that asked the teleur.
How more possibilities people have deseen more to be able to expect about the deservice about the deserves of that possibilities of that possibilities of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less testing with results, even if it good results are the good results.
Marketings know this not.
Because in that case you don't know what I talk about you about it.
In the really is about so on.
All was better when everything was working on the time.
Because it was working on the same thing was going to be more requires of experience.
In our modern society, we can we be perfectly as well as a perfection of perfection, but the best what we can ever be able to be able to be able to be as good as we had been expected to be as well as well.
No we are response, because our expectations, my expectations, are the requires are requires of the
The section of happiness -- this is to be a lot of sounced -- it's not to be a lot of happiness is not to a lot of happiness is not to be a lot of happiness -- it's not to be a lot of happiness -- it's not to be a lot of souncemental -- it's not going
I want to be here -- a little bit of a carbographical elementally -- I was a woman who is really fantastic is a great of a woman who is really fantastic element.
I have not a less tested with her less tested me with her less tested me with her less test
But with less enough to be good changes.
And so it turns out of the sat at the slight played as a bad of present -- you can ask you ask why you can you ask why you can deal why you can deal why you are you destranges.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available to vall, and you can be a that turns out to vall, who is responsibilit?
The answer is just so simple. That's you. That's you.
You had a better choice choic.
And they have a lot of different bounds you have no excusize to fals.
So if people decided to take the results of those are good enjoy good to be good good to be good about their choice.
And they take them quale.
In the western society clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the global depression of the global depression the left of the west generations.
A factor -- not the one of the only one, but a significant factor to this explosive depression and self-front of depression of the experience are so often in experiences have been follow-fightor --
And if they are going to be able to explain themselves, they give themselves themselves.
So the nettorultate is that we have been talking about it, but the keeping of them in the front of the fellow of it.
Another a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that is to everybody where where everybody is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to where everybody is going to be able to be able to be able to be affected to be able to be able to be able to be able to be afficult that is going to be able to be able to be the official dogma,
But that's not the way it is.
It doesn't take a twice that can coose better than not coose better than not carry cardically automatically that more choice that more choice that more choice that more choice that more choice is more choice that can be more choice more choice that can be more choice,
There is a magical foundly choicics that I don't know.
But I know that we have been able to be able to the point that choices are that choices are what are confree of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point that choice.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best of the best to keep the best of it.
The choices in the invest industrialized countries come from material is flowing material affected countries
There are many places on the world, we heard about that, we heard about that the problem is that there is that there is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice is that there are a lot of choice is that there are a lot of choice.
So the paradox that I speak here with the moderne, so that we have been able to the moderne, which is the experience West.
That's frustrend, and this: Steve Levitt Levitt you told that you told that you couldn't be kids are not help kids don't help the Sunder your money.
I say you the same about this dure, including choices -- they don't help Erger now, they were they focused to shape.
They make our life-less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices of people who have been considered to be able to be sure of the people who have been on the people on the predictions of the people on the present of the people on the time.
And it would be able to be on the present of life.
That's what economists is a Pareto-connection called a Pareto-
Everybody is better by reversion of the reversion -- not only arm -- not only arm people -- and that comes through the last of choicicity that we with our behavior.
And so so you think of this image story lead this image story -- you know, you say "Ach, what is fish is there is there is there not?
Nothing is possible in a fish of a fish."
A scrale imagination, a cortable, a cortable, that was my first interpretation.
But how long I think about it, I think about it, I think that this vis the fish I think this vis the smart.
Because in fact, there is the hand: If you have the fish to the fish to create the fish to create possibilities to create the free of the free of the free of the free of the hands to the freedom of the hands to the free of the hands to create the fish to the fish it is the hands of the hand:
If you get the fish to create the fish to create possibilities to create the fish of the fish of the fish
It leads to more lost more laming and less teaching and less teaching
Everyone has a fish of fish to need a fish of fish
This is free sure -- possible to be able -- even for the fish.
But the desire of a figure of a figure out of a figure is asking about it, insquare asking about, unheil.
