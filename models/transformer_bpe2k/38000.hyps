Last year, I showed these two dias, to show that the pooly capacity, which was the pool, which had about the past three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the several problem because it didn't show the dic problem because it didn't show the dic problem that shows the ice.
The ice ap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, the shell of our global climate system.
It turns out to the winter and crimpt into the summer.
The next slides I shows is a accelerated version of what happened the past 25 years.
The permanent ice is dump in the red.
As you see it back to dark blue.
That's the annual ice ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called called ice, five years or older, five years or older, is almost like blood, that from the body.
In 25 years is it going to this forward this to this forward in 25 years.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icelerate Icelation and there is a very large amount of frozen carbon is that when it was a very large amount of carbon is being being confromble.
Some of the total destincluding total destiny in the atmospheres that could double, if we were double, if we were describe the critical.
In some undeep a few undeep in Alaska signs of methane on from the water.
Professor Katey Walter was the University of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to improve more.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question or we will be that we will be that are.
A reason for that, is that this huge "warmtebron' Greenland from the north.
This is a melt melt river.
The water volume is the catch volume is a bigger than ever.
This is the Kanger-suaded river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea squire is because it takes the land is the place where it comes in the sea.
These flow are taking flight.
And on the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ics on Earth.
And the last month reporteds scientists that the whole continent now that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole is in the South Pole very quickly sound of south past of waterers.
The whole continent is going to be sea set of sea set foot sea-foot sease.
In the Himalaya, the on two of the biggest ice mass, there are new now, who were still glaciers were still glaciers were still glaciers were going to be glaciers were still in the Himalaya,
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that mely.
In the Anth, is this gap, the glester of drinking water for this city.
There are now more powers today.
But when they disappears disappears are also drinking water.
In California was there a 40 percent of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are severe several at the time.
This global dream of the dream of a dramatic styer of forests burns.
And the number of phraramites all over the world is speech, and never see a single speed.
Four times in the last 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the fore-year-old in the 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkedable.
If you look at it from a historic context of a historic context of what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 ton CO2 every 24 hours.
25 mics ton every day in our oceans, every day in our ocean area of the Pacifical of the Stille Ocean, and each side, and every size of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of the ocean subcontinent, there is a drastic dalation.
The only big cause of the global warming, the earth, next to deforestation, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels, is burning of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and coal is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the largest of the largest of China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon and build a lot more coalone.
But we see a bommitacy.
These are the coal-carbon carbon was the cooler that built was annual years and where green alternatives were proposed to be proposed to be proposed to the bigger and big,
There is echose a political fightforward to the crowd in our country.
The coal carbon and oil induster gave induster 250 million dollars to promote "shared stead of promoting coal coal coal coal of cool, which is a conversation of the conversation of the cool,
And that image did something about it.
And the Churstmas was at home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons of gallons of challenged parts of challenged parts of the choice.
You probably seen it in the news of the news of the news
This is the biggest disconceiver, in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking on the cost cooking at the Kaster was these.
Video: "Frosty is the coal ♫ ♫ Frosty is a key free guy.
He's liquid is abundance here in America, and he makes our economy.
Frosty the costy guy is scann with the day.
He's paid and cute and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from the coal in West Virginia froms.
The biggest mines of the country is the great major of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate protection two campaigs on the country two campaigns on the bottom of the purposed to the Klimate.
This is a piece of one of them
Video "Bray, COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threats for our things.
That's the reason the reason the most important goal is to give a giant behavior to reach a giant connect to the light and the regular of the truth of the truth of cool.
Feit is, coal is not smarium.
We find that it is clean is -- and it still such a little bit more likely to be a bull.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just let us talk about it.
Video: Schone co, Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-in-calling guy cooler centrale.
Fantastic! The machines are making the machines are making the machines are very difficult to make the machines are making the machines are making the machines are making the machines are very died.
But that's the sound of shone coal coal technology.
Despite the fact that the breaking coal one of the most important causes of global warming the global warming is the remarkbbony that you see all the shone of the earth is all the shone of the earth is all the global warming of global warming is the desp

The red in all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuels, like dirty coly, like dirty coly and imported oily oil.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of it.
For America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get the work to get a plan that makes us safer and the global warming of the Earth is equality of the Earth is the operation of the Earth is a plan to make us safer that makes us safer and the global warming.
And it was a solution that requirs that really, is enough to solve our problems.

Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called back to a update about how that machine works.
So here I am for those who don't waren't hold, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever undernenearly 27 miles in enoms, 27 miles in engine.
It has to be the circumstances that were dedicated less than a billions of second after the universe started to be a second after the universe started to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitius, so fortun!
This is the machine underneath Genee.
We took that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. And this is the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter whether is wider in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in connections so you can see the scale.
And then the first time, we put the machine for the first time, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that causes a party cample in the controlling camp.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all around the LHC, and with opposed with a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which was flows in the detector of the flows and set up with a piece of the LHC, which was founded by the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that was working that the machine is a huge overcome that is a huge overhead.
I don't know if this was the biggest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page for it.
And that means that we made a kind of a cultural as a scientific impact.
And one week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden drads.
And they were 13 thousand ample thousand ample competition when the machine on the full force.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they are superago, because they are superago,
So on minus 27, in millions, the space between the stars, that can be flowed into the behaviors that flows that flows that flows that flows that flows into the behaviors that flows.
In one of the connectivity between nine thousand magnts in the LHC, was a constructivate a constructivate constructivity.
And it was the wire was something like that, and was insuddenly electrical resisted to that 13 thousand ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still more than 20 tons if you realize that that that the magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons and they were moved about 30 inches.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to do them out of it, what we did to do.
We have all saved them when they all touched them
And now they are back on the road.
Eind map the LHC again.
We will put it back back and we expect it to measure in june or justice, so that we can go on and figure out what the building bits of the universe.
Now, of course, they have been able to reincludebate again about the value of scientific research.
I think it's the fact that it's so difficult that we go further than the way that is the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words of the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would take the degree of the value of the value of his learning was the teaching of his learning was Michael Farad, and the Parages of human mind is so dangerous for the progregate of human mind that we are taking to the progregate of science that there are no new world's really, that there are no new world."
Thank you very much.
I would like to start asking you to ask you to ask your children's time when you were playing with blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it to grab and pulled them up and conscious, you were actually detect the teaching with and hanging through the insible relations.
Rumintely insight, because with understanding the world to understand the world around us.
If a information that if an information inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my compassion of Kalanithi -- I started to ask me wonder -- what if we would use a computer of ancient -- what if we would be able to ask a computer that one of the indigenous fingertip that moves on a plate of individual foundation that would be able to be smoke and cattempted with become a vate physics to be able to gragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragragrab that
and can order ordering the way we want to ?
This question was so very conceived that we decided to find an answer, by building Siftables.
Cort summary is a Siptable computer size of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow.
They can be moved with the hand move each other, they can feel their movement detect and they contain a screen and wirels contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical treatment is the physical treatment as blocks that they can be moved by it.
And the most of the Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulation of digital information.
And this is that these aid resources are more physical differentling their movement and even of the way we move them and even of the way we move and nice interactions and nice interactions and nice interactions of the way we move and nice interactions are discovering them and nice interact with the way we are moving and nice interactions of
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that is a video that plays and others and others on the office, and others are playing a little bit of the celerate.
This interactive portraits are consciously.
Indian next next to each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they get surround, they also engaged and can be able to get some nervous of nerve and get some nervous.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday areas is a birth of the cross-birth as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of color as it was a fluid of the interaction of this interaction,
In this example three Siftables emmer to be emmountains, and I can use them to go color in a employed in a employed in a employed in a employed to go into a employed in this example of the example --
If we have threw over the time, we went back a little bit of the back.
There are some of the city of the cut of education, mathematics and logic crumate and logic where we want to give people to the opportunity to proach things quickly to see the outcome to see.
So here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci running a rocks of a simple account programmats.
Here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every randomly around the randomly of any Siftable, and shaptic words are are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is that it's very rescue, and appearing a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I have been able to make a video of them to try to make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed to have instructions.
Everything you have to say, "Most word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people test the testing ones.
That's our youngest ber breezing right board, righting the right bottom.
And it turns out that he was just to stack the Siftables left
And for him that were only blocks.
Here is being shown a interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning from language.
This is Felix that demos demos
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters in the table with that character of the table with that character of the table with that characters in the table.
Here he leaves the sun emerged the sun emerged.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good god! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the near of Siftables and the near side, he can respond to each other, and to each other,
DM: and so his own storytelling its own storytell.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to deal with it.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music chilment that we developed recently, where every Sifttables and drum.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the emptables are injected so you can determined the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern Siftables are in the pattern Siftables are in the pattern Siftables can be injected in the pattern in the pattern Si
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the presentation of an art Siftable effects like reverb and filter.
They are being added a sound and provided by the office, and by purchase.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are properly admitted on the whole pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern of the entire pattern effects like tempo and volume that are being added on the entire pattern of the pace effects like tempo and the volume of the
Let's look at that.
Video: We start with a living in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I feel add a little bit.
Video: And now I copy the movie to the prints, so I can affect the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect of the press,
Video: I can accelerate it by the offices of the pace of the pace of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the bas for the bas for the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can reach the pattern as it is a pattern while it plays to the pattern as it is playful.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything else and make improvise that I want to do.
And finally the dimessage of the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to left the left Siftabric left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is going to make new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better detect in the way our brains and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area that we develop in this design area that we develop in the laborate in the lab.
The thought I want to talk about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation of aid media, that bring the information with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want to it.
Thank you.
I look at it to talk to you with all of you all the time.
I'm writing.
Buth is my work, but also writing is so much more than that.
My whole life I've been writing for writing and I don't think that that will change.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and career and career and career that I had to go and career my work with my work on the work on my work on
It started a book that I wrote recently I wrote recently, "Et, Bidden, Bids, Beminnera that very very contradiction to my first work about the whole world and an international exister to my first work about the world and an international exister was a very exister seller exister was a very very exister to my first work on
The consequence is that people now have to be all over the place, and always pulling the way to do I do job.
And the thing that -- is dome!
People come to me and questions to me and questions "Do you don't know that success, you can't equar?
Don't you do that you will keep your whole life will write your whole life but never a book that people for warm, but never publics where people will walk for warm.
Do you don't have frigh?"
It's very disconnected, you know.
Of course, that would be very of, but I remember that I was a teenager, 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,
People said, "Do you don't get success?
Do you don't know afraid you will go on the bottom by it?
Do you don't know that your life on this work without saying with no thing that there has ever something from the bitter of your broken dry on your broken dreams on your bitter axis of bitter's bitter's axis of fail?"
Something in that streting.
In the short, my answer is coming to ask on that questions on this saying, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all of those things that are called called "Seas I think things that are called called
All of the time.
But I'm also for a lot of other things frightening front of things that all of things that one.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what I write is writing myself the last time I wonder where that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be a fear for worth to work for the work for that they have to their opinion.
What's so particularly as a creative processes that we make sure that we make sure the effects of the mind-estesco-de-working something something that doesn't happen at the time.
Take my da. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a chemistry in the 40 years he was ever asked somebody ever asked somebody ever was frightened anybody was not front there.
And so of that, "Yohn, how did it with your chemistryblock?"
No, so it was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair chemistry to be fair by the centuries have no reputation of the reputation of malcoholists.
You know, they would be like this reputation.
Not just writers also writers, other creative people have been pretty instable, instable.
And look at the grim of the grim death the most magnific creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own own advocable.
And even those who don't even suicide place, seem to be under their gave to be under their gave to be suicide their gave today.
In the last interview for his dead Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's what about to say to say about your life-work.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at anymore.
We heard it all earlier and have heard it with set my spiring.
The surface is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked to suffering and that an artist-exist will lead to miserable,
So why do I want to ask everyone here today do you with that idea living?
Do you do that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think I don't think about it, I think it's not a very high day.
I think it's residented.
And even even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is that this century also so on.
We can do creative mind a lot better approach.
I'm sure that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my mind,
In fact, the phase of my career is in the phase of career now.
Go too, I'm still young, a veil, a veil,
I can do maybe four decades.
Hharvest everything I'm going to be all of the extraordinary world as the work that followed that extraordinary successful book.
We're here with friends under the another, so I can be able to set that is probably my biggest success alone,
Jemig, what an idea!
If you think about it, you're going to think about it, you're going to know the morning, you know the tends to the neine o'clock for the derank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love to work of the work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go through write when I can go through write a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of building.
I have to write a safe distance of creating myself and my convert to create the very understanding fear of the reactions on my future publications.
I've been looking for the last year, I was looking for ways to do that.
I'm in the history and I do in the history and have found me in other societies to see or others or perhaps somebody have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search a quest me at the old Greeks and Romens.
And I want to go on and complicated story.
In the old Greeks and Roma's time of the old Grees and Romains, people didn't have that creativity was from hene.
And they believed that creativity is a display that creativity of a display, untable place to the human beings and unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these guy calling minds the helping minds of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon who was a demon who was influistered him --
The Romino had a similar idea.
In them was a called creative mind creative mind creative mind."
The funny is that the Rombs with a genius with a genius to be a very particular pipiently adapted a particular pipment is that the Rome.
In their polite was a genius a kind of magical god-detectate that were in the walls of the artist.
A little like Dobby the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the househ.
If the artists was working the genius assistention.
And he gave it work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I had the earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work on the work.
The artists was so in protection to the protection too much narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all the honor for that.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius you had helped to help you have helped to it.
Do you get to work on your work is not just set to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather includes of inhanded a rather inid geniion.
And the very time is that the way in the West creativity was considered to the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed
There is a very new idea: the individual human is the individual human is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, purching from the divast of the divast world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual case.
And for the first time in history was there about artists said that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that I think I should say that a big mistake
To let one person, one single individual that he or she or she is the vehicle-hicle-century of all the dive of the mystery, of all the dive and the known connected for a fragiment, creative and the known consider the city of a fragile human psyche.
It's like somebody asks the sun into swallows the sun into the sun
Egos are being bload to giant proportional proportional proportional expectations to prestatible to prestations to prestations to prestations to be copposed to prestations
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists.
If that's so on, and I think, and I think, "What new?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back on an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can rational rational humanism not until undeft in a 18 minutes to speed.
Probably in the audiences people who required scientific about the idea that elicians, about the idea that elicians, which are actually bringing the artists.
It doesn't seem to get me all of you will get to me all of that.
And I ask it goes.
Why doesn't do it?
Why wouldn't we have this thought not to do that though,
It just so much as much as wells as much as all the other explanations of totally calculate the incalculate process, and the including the creative process.
Everybody who try to create something that has to create something -- so in fact, all of the attacks here -- it doesn't always beat the creative process doesn't always rational behaving rational mouse.
And that sometimes it took a paranormy.
I have the great American ansoes Ruth Stone of the great American dicheese.
She's thick in the nine-graining ones.
She told me about her childhood, on the Virginia.
Sometimes if she was on the field, they felt the set, they were to get a poem on the country.
It was so so said, as though there was a big wave air of air
And so the country to get into the country to her country to move the country to her
She felt that the ground, she was started shaking and she knew that her at that time, and she knew that was to set her life.
She ran home, and she was single paper and then she had to do the paper and paper and paper paper and paper to pick and paper and paper to pick out and paper and paper and paper to painting.
When it came through her hand her hand her hand her hand her only moving her only chance to write it on the way to write it.
Sometimes she wasn't very quickly.
Then ring and ring them, but crossing it doesn't go home.
And at the moments of the moments of the poem by her hich, search -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different poets.
And I also also also know -- this is the most beautiful part of the story -- they were the poem of the story -- they almost mist.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper and paper and paper the paper by her hiching her and paper to her home in house.
And at that potle-tttle-paking a pencil.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she was following the poem of air.
She pulled it to his tail and it back into its body, and it back into her body, while she wrote it back into her body, and she wrote it back into her body, and she wrote it back into its body, and she wrote it back into its body, and she wrote it back into her body, and she wrote it back into its body, and she was back to
In those case, the poem came close to be very close to paper on paper and it was very cut in the paper was tracked followed by the way.
When I heard that -- I thought -- what accident, I thought that is going to be my creative proces!
This is what my creative process. I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who has been a mouth, which is floor, and sweep and trans through blood, sweep, and trans through it.
But even in that daily swood, I had such a experience.
You will also know it yourself feeling that there's a sense that creative ideas in your record from a source that can identify impossible.
What is that then for brone?
How can we use it without we get it without the heads of the one?
As a way that is good for us,
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I was interviewed it for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is the major part of his life was the showing of the contemporary artists that are tries that are tries that are tries to get grip on the unconnections in the under of creative impulses in him.
And the 190s was Tom a little bit more restant --
And one day he was in Los Angeles about the fast road, and changed the process of radically radically
And as he was so so, he heard a fragmentally a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that is more graph -- ingraph --
It was a nice melots and he wanted to hold it and he wanted to hold it to hold it the vasthous.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper tles, no paper at a taneously in the bottom.
The well-known excited about him: "I reach the melodd the melodies and then it stays and then it stays backwide to feel backing.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not panic, he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the sense of the air and he looked at the point?"
"Do you think I can write a song nois?
If you really want this song of coming up to that, you have to take a little bit later, you have to adapted when I have a time for you.
Don't do that, then somebody elsewhere.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment when it was losing the process of very different.
The work is the same thing, with the known of the most known support of the most exist.
But the heavy that the creative process in the creative process in the way he disappeared.
The genius was the genius and provide the skin, and support the skin.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go on the bottom of it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the property of Tom and the propertily aspect that not quite quite a way of Tom themselves.
And that story has changed my way of works.
I've already had profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle, Bidding, Beminners.
And at a point point I left in despase.
You know that you want to do it, but not good work, and you think it's a terrible disaster. The worst book.
Not just bad a bad that is really horrible bad and it's really very very running --
I wanted to do all the project all project to do all the project of all the project
And then I remembered to be that adapted to his genius, and I also decided to way.
I wonder of my manuscrip, and I focused crip, and focused of the room of the room.
And I said to the hardoper: "Lister then, we know that if this book is not just because of this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have in the way in what I have in my mind.
I can't give you a little bit of it.
If you find that it better than you have to get your things, you have to get your things.
Do you don't do that, you don't do that, you ammer thank you.
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the noteros are distinguished that is just a different degree on the office of office."
Tja--- U.S. it's going to be up here on this ...
Euhairs ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in the North African desert of sily music.
Even and hours, and hours, to the morning, until slides.
That was always wonderful, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, it happened to be something very homorrow.
One of those dancers then transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know what I mean, you have ever seen something like a performance in a perform of a performer.
It was like the time was stilling and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I had all together.
And it seemed to be seemed to be just a human beings a human beings
In him, under him above him of it.
A deadly free of a gart of challenged a god.
And if something that happened to knew the time was Dan were actually killing them to clap, and bound, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because it was for them.
By the fun of the nice fact, historic fact, when the Moren Spanin Spanin Spain Spain of Spain the way to do it.
The outcome, is the crazy by the centuries of "Allah."
And that you hear the day at the time today and fighting and flaments and flaments and flaments fighting godancing and flaments
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magic, and it says, "Allah, oh, oh, great, oh, great, fresh, bringing it in the well.
Spiled, disease, a glimpse of God.
And the recipe we need to do it.
Lasty is that the dance of the dance of the dance of the morning, he discovered on dinary Turn the morning, at the morning,
At that moment he is a little older guy with regular batch that will never come to such up to such highs.
Maybe there will never took somebody God will never attace to dance anybody else in dance.
What does he have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sells for a creative minds.
But it doesn't have to be so much it doesn't be to be too high.
Imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person are coming from your person from you.
Imagine that you believe that you have a while, you have a while,
When you are ready with it, they get given to someone else.
And so that it is the way to consider.
I include incentive that thought of the thought of the thought of the thought.
The last months I've been working on a book that will be inside that will ship. The book where a lot of a lot to be reflected to be refrigeration to be excited.
The opportunity of that illuster progress.
If my mind with me on the hall, I like the same one, I like the same one, I don't know that the same one.
Do just do you work.
And just to do you do things, whatever it is.
If you're too dancing you to dance you, thank you.
If the god-detect genius is detect to make a little bit of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of "Oly."
As that not, then, then, then, I think,
And then "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that of heart.
"Oh, anything, because we ite, because we can do a pure human love, and propertily by plums.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean,
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to digital and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology with the design and synthetism and synthetthesize life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think about a lot of biologists have tried to understand the way to understand in different levels.
We tried different approach, it back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize of digitize it.
When we have sequenced the human genome called the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for the question of life can we create new life, or can we create new life, from this digital universe?
This is the card of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can reach themselves in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nattine.
We can go into the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolic card is that relatively relatively compared to the inset.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch out is very unlikely that this would be a living cell of living cell that this would be a living cell of living cell that could be able to switch a living cell of the genes that could be a living cell the genes that could be a living cell cell the genes that
And we decided that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome, so we could actually detect the components to make the components of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like this: "Can we started a chromosome of the synthess?"
Staking the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, if we do that, you know, a chromosome "e?
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way, a piece of chemical chemical ints of chemical inges
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitize of the digitize of the digitial change.
And our ability to write the genetic code rather slose of the genetic code of a long sums.
And our last point the moment would put it on an exponential curve.
We're over 15 years ago,
There were some stadia for invited to start with a bio-ethic adthic adthic advances to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be the synthesis of DN
There are teenthousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the more mistake, so the more mistakes you make a piece of them, the more mistakes are in the world that make a little bit of them, the more mistakes in the world that make a de
So we had to make a new method for conceiving these little pieces and correct the correct of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria ky virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, we did the past correction
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
It started to make a little bit of the exciting part of the bacteria chemical chemical chemical fellow in the bacteria the genetions and virtually making the genetions and virtually making the genetions and making virtually making the genetions and making the bacteria --
The virale particles were when they were going to get out of the cells, they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but have to well.
They laught more than you.
So we think this situation is a situation where the software building hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something biggers.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes that we could various the cassettes variety of the cassettes --
to go to understand what the components are the conditional components of a living cel.
The design is crital, and if you start start with digital information in the computer than that the digital information that are involving information very accuraate.
When we first assumed this genome to 1995 was the detect in 1995, a mister of one ers.
And eventually we found after resequencing 30 mistaks. If we had used the original sequence than it was not able to start on the original sequence than resequence to start.
Mority of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be abundance with all other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-unities that we need to design together so that they can design together so that they can design together.
We design unique parts in the unique parts
Maybe you have read that we put water brand we put water square in the water market of it that we put water into the watermarks.
Dix, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, GGood and T.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there is a single inoxximaction for every amino acid of every amino acid of every amino acid of the meters code of every aminoxximacted for every aminoxurs.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, seeing the genetic code to write the genetic code to do the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code to write,
We can only do we do a signs for a little signment.
Some of them were disappowered that there were no poems.
We have this pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzymes.
There are enzymes that they repairs and put together.
And we started to make pieces of making pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, only they were five to 7,000 letters long, just take a 24,000 letter, and then sets of the 72,000.
In every stadium, we week a abundance of these pieces so we could sequence because we could create a process because we want to create a process that is going to be very robuying --
We try to achieve the point of automatished the point of automatished.
So this looks like a basketball final.
And as we get to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 bases -- they don't grow up to the big pieces -- they don't grow so easy more in E.
And that turns the most of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to reach the other mechanises.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-recombination that is used by the biology to repairs, which is used by the biology to repairs, that can feed bits can feed bits together.
Here is an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinocococcus radio durans that three million radiation of radiation to the radiation of radiation to the side.
And that you see in the top panel, sopm is just set up the top panel, just sopm from other.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it back into the sizes on the sizes of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up to be drood.
They can live in a vacuum.
I'm sure that there can living in space that there can be life in space that can promove to move the new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the way from this is outside.
Here is a realm microph of the molecule that we made with this processes -- in the molecule -- in fact, with just yester-art mechanisms with the right design,
And it gives that they feed automatically foot care about it
This is not an electron-microscope photograph, this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes are taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we recently recently,
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a humans, with a very clear structure.
The molecules, over 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code the genetic code down.
Now, how do we started to get a chromosom?
And it's obvirus is it very clear to be easy pretty easy.
And a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a little bit of eukaryots, as well, you know, you knew the cell and does another in, and that's what you know when it is what you know when it is what you know when it is what you know when you are scaling as it is what you know when it is what you know when it is what you know when it is what you know when you know as it wells.
In the bacteria species of the bacteria chromosome of the cell, but we have set that we have a full transplllant to a full transplantation of a chromosome of a cell transpllant to another, and it can activate the bacteria of a cell and the activity.
We have a chromosome of the pursuit of a microms.
These are about as far as far from each other.
We put some extra little extra little bit so that we could select for this chromosome.
We have an enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought that he would come to get it to soon, but we tried to develop the process of what further.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of chromosome of the third chromosome of thousands of properties in one time to the species in one time to the species of the species.
People who proposed to proposed to be equal to be a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are enzymes that are restriction enzymes that are actually restrict DNA
The chromosome that was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome that we put in it -- we put it in it --
It was express and it was present the other chromosom, and it was a strange of material, and so we had the eventually got the cell with the new chromosome.
He was bluue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappeared, all the characteristics of one species and changed completely into the new species that we put in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein the membranes changed the genetic code -- when we laughes, it was changed in which it changed was changed in the membranes changed the genetic code of the membranes changed the genetic code -- when we were changed the genetic code membranes --
This is a genomic, as genomic, but we are in the changes of the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
Well, I've been paid earlier to, I paid this is not a creation -- this is a propertboard, in 3.5 billion years evolution, and I've paid I've paid an explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Camic brical explosion where there are great species on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
And I think it's pretty clear if you look at what is going to need to be looking at what is going on.
We're going to be inside of six-and-a-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in my context.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 40 years.
We have a little bit of food, with the care of clean water, medicine, medicine, medicine, for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's going to be hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion ton collaps, over 30 billion ton coly.
That's 100 miloons of the hundred of miloons of the day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than any process than the way to replace that is going to be a huge challenged challenge.
And then of course, is all of the carbon dioxide of the bitch that comes in the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere.
And in all our worldwide discoveries we have this database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has been able to the diversity that has come from the diversity that has been out of the electronics had to be the diversity that has been going to be in the electronices of the consity that has come from the electronicaway.
We're very constently limited by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques of synthesesemethods to do so called combination genomics to do combination genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes per day.
If you think that if you think about the processes or tries to optimalized to optimalizing octon or drugs, or to produce octane, new vaccins, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard.
We can select select for lives, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen map of what real design, real design software where we work, so you can really go on the computer and design a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of computer in the computer of the computer to design and a new kind of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer that we can design and make a new kind of the computer of the real design.
We don't know about it.
We know exactly how their genetic code from the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of their genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of exactly what their genetic code is looks
We focus on four generation fuels.
And the same ones you have seen to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuels that will come out of sugar like sugar more fuels like sugar more fuels like octan arrios.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price without the food price and availability to reduce CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food supposed to design that way, and so we think that we are doing the first four first generation of the first four first generation burns within about 18 months of a months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our global discoveries of discoveries we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepsea, about 2.5 miles deep, at the deep, at cooking head temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy sources as energy sources.
We're looking at the way or we can take CO2 and we can take a pipipate through pipes that CO2 to factories that that CO2 fuel to send this process, to send this process.
So in a short of a short adapted we are able to break out on the basal question: "What is life?"
We have reality, you know -- you know -- the departments are replaced the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this, where you can't do this, where then you can do it?
A major energy source is getting a major energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the use of these tools to be able to think about quickly-servaccines of vaccines --
This year, we always have the flu, we always walk in the facts of the facts of the facts of vaccine,
I think that can change by temporary vaccines of vaccines in the degree vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see that the future is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerate of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still away from the improve people.
And our goal is to imagine that we make a chance to make a long enough to survive for a long enough to do that may be doing that.
What I want to show you as a first quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we were in a consider to Microsoft rock about a year ago.
And it's a environment where you get locally or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data that can work
We look at the time here is a lot of gigabytes and can square to set on on the in--- and challenge and challens.
And it doesn't matter how much information we need information to look at how much information or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan from the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of Congress,
It doesn't matter because it would be only what the prestations would infood on a third of the prestations of the display on the screen on the screen is on the screen is on the screen is the prested of the disperm.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book a completely book that the in-image data.
This is the gravity by Dickens. Each column.
To prove that it's really texty, and we can't do something that we can do something that we can do something that is really text, to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of read to read a very e-book a e-book a strange of read a book a strange of a book a strange way to read a book strange of maybe this is a very e-book to read a little bit strange of read a book a strange of strange in the way to
I wouldn't adapty.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a submitted to the submitted of a submitted of a big.
This is really gives you the fun, and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale member, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something with the corner of this expensive of the Guardian.
We made a ness advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have inbright.
If you want to see the opportunities of this car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really do the limitations of treating through the screen through the screen through the screen of the screen by the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the things that are able to do the screen of the screen of the screen of the things that are able to do the constrainft.
We hope that this doesn't mean this is not a pop-ups and other such flaw -- not needed to be more flaul -- not needed to be more flaul -- not needed to be more flautor of other flaue -- not needed that this doesn't mean that means no longer ups.
Of course, the landscapes are a maps of our countries are applicating for a technology like this, I'm going to spending on here -- I'm going to spending, except that we can also contribute to this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top on top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, which is a connection to each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very nice computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening research, provening on the University of Washington, led by Steve Seitz at U.Washington,
and Rick Sberberber, at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's made possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that we can experience through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution --
The spatial slightly of the images has meaned here.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images so they conceived with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are taken by the Canama hot of panorama or panora hot and all these things are space telagent diassion.
I'm not sure or there is a other environments.
There are more more more more more more more space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we work in this summer -- to the communicate is the reality of the environments -- to the environments of this environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with with pictures from Flickr. You just look for a Dame on in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus, and the campus, and the campus,
And each of these orange chains, a picture that turns out to be part of this model was a picture again.
And so this is all Flickr images, which are copious images, which are spending in this way of the photographs.
And we can do at simple way we can do at a simple way to do navigate at the time
You know, I had never thought I'd never thought that I would have ever work.
It's overwhelming here to be getting so until here.
I believe you can see that this are cameras are cameras are cameras is all the gammirror to mirror reflexcameras a big number of it,
I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so many covered by facing faces and so on.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here they are all the time.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chose chured by the program.
If we did, if we dive the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say that we can do things with the social environment, this is the data of everyone -- of the entire collective memory of the entire there -- and heading everyone else's -- and it's all the way that everyone elsewhere.
All these pictures are being moved with each other, and shapes together is a very bigger than the shares of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth
This as a following on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Are work the Virtual Ath.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they used to use it and also grow the benefits of the benefits for the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being provided to be a bunch of metap-tan-on-foot metap-data that somebody else invoted to the metap-data that somebody else invo.
If somebody would want to climits and put their names and their names and their names is going to be able to climits of the Notre Dame is requirs that data, and that can I use as an access to the space, which metap-versus and create a kind of cross that metap-fale, and created a kind of cross-like social experience.
And of course, is the side product of this immense rich virtually model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only from air photographs, satellits, satellites, but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that makes you understood that makes your software that in the next years, all the images that can be did, all the images that can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is really what this is discovery.
It creates to your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that basis of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is a semantic information that are many of these pictures.
When you look for the web of the web and you take a search a search, and the text on the webpage on the webpage of information about what the image is giving the image represent.
What if now is that copainy to all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes from that prevulsiantic is a classic networks effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure of traveling and of events and eat the potential to live between those who are not forget to live in the wind, who are not forget to feel in the wind, which are feeling in the wind, profits, the profitabulous stones, the profitable planning is profitable to live in bitters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky Way, or that the myths of Inch-olding meant to message is that in the Himalaya boodd-aded in the breathing still are jaze of Dhars you remember of Dhar, you remember of the anthropology: the world that we live in the lives that we live in an absolute smodel is not a sacropology, but is still one of the reality,
the consequence of an accidentally, adaptation choices that made our ancestors generations.
Of course, we all parts of the same adapted require degree -- the people were born.
We all make inform invite rites all the time.
Again, with the intaneous disconnectedous die.
So it can't be surprising that we all all singing, and dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythms, and the rhythm's dance in every different culture.
Or now that is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodoo-Saitulis in Haiti or the U.K. Caisut in North Kaisut in North Kenya, the Curandero in the Caravanai in the Caravanavanavana-hara. This is the guy with angry with the desert of Quoooown, or a ma, regma,
Everest, the god-mother of the world.
They all teach us that we can be different, different different different from the Earth, or us to orients.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea of notion is just just hope you can just give hope to the hope of it.
Samen the intelligentable cultural and the web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life that is the planet and the biological life: the biospiritual life, the biospiritual and the biospiritual and shapes the biospiritual and shapes the planet, and the intelligency is the planet and the intellikely of the entire and shapes the planet of the engineering of spiritution,
This cultural life-web you can imagine as a etnos;
The eator you can defining to defining as the totally of all the thoughts of all the daites, myths, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are conscious by human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness,
The etnosing is the great nalatenacy of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all of that we are and all of all of that we are as amazing curious species of animals.
like the biosphere is a bigger mate.
No would be a biologist would be saying that at least half of all the species of all the species of all the species of extinct, because it's simply not true.
And the most optimistic scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of this is the loss of this is the loss of this is the loss of the loss of this is the loss of the loss of this is the loss of the loss of this is the loss.
And then everyone was born to the Earth, there were six-thousand languages.
A language is more than her word or her grammatical rules --
A language is a fick of the human vision.
It's the vehicle that that the soul of every unique culture the material world is reaching the material world.
Every language is a century ancient ancient an ancient age, a separty, an ecosystem that we have a spiritual potential opportunities.
And from that six, the talks today is not the day half of that are not in children's ordinary of that are flusted in children.
They are not taught babies longer learned to be babies longer
Effective means that unless a change that unless a change, that they are dead.
Is there something called a single of being aid by silence, the last of your people, the last of your full too to speak the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the kids?
And the recipe of that tergenous is somewhere, because every two weeks of it on Earth, because every two weeks and dies it dies the last letter greats of an older language.
Some of you say, "Super, the world don't like the world don't have a better place, if we all were going to speak as we would speak for the same language. I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba tines.
Or Kogi.' You will realize what it would be a realize how it would be a temporary language.
So what I want to do today is to take you on a short journey by the evocable, which has to sketch a picture of what is actually lost a picture of what I actually want to be lost to the bottom.
And many of us that when I have to do it in "Actually, I also really mean, I really really really mean.
Take this Barasana-child in the North Amazone, the people, the people, the people, the people, that believes that believes that believes that believes the galif, in the tubed of the East Comercised in the neighborhoods.

"See? It's like I said you have said.
And it's the way to protect this is too protection." They call themselves the older brothers.
We are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
At this point is intuitive agency very important.
If we think about inhead of inhead, we often Rously and we often Rousands and the old, a idea that racistic in his simplicity in his simplicity.
Or we took Thoreage and say that these peoples are closer to the Earth is than us.

For both is very little space in the malaria moers of the Amat or or the icrocks of Tibet. Desalnietmin they have a traditional mystic of the Earth is that not consciously, which is not consciously, but in a very much more subtiny, but in a much more subtiny, it's based on a much more subtin: the idea that the Art is just that the Asty human being, human beings.
What does that mean? It means that a little child from the Anthy child from the Anthy belief that the mountain an Apu-mine human beings are going to lead a fundamental other relationship of Montana, and a different relationship than Montana, and a different relationship than Montana, is growing up with the idea that the mountain to mine.
Or it the living of a mind or a lot of it is irrelevant to be a lot of it is irrelevant to be a lot of it.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to be crasses to be crasses to be crossed to be cut up.
And that made me another person made my friends of the Kwagiul-friends who believe that that forests are the honsteps the Kaxy and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel and the cannificant in the world round in the world rounds of the world swwings.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-inference.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can create different reality of realities can create different reality for some of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture that I april right in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating is so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of it, but how it is. It's built from two sources of sources.

The plant is being mixxes of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee in the free of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee is a frequires.
The plant tryptaminy ptamines, narrative because to brain serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryltryltryltry-ptamine,
Do you ever see the Yanomami when they were that snuion, that too, who are substance of different species that methoxyltryltryptamine ptamin tremendous species that are also contained substance of different species that are substance of different species that too,
That powder your nose nose in bline, as a puzzzled with barokay, to cut baroks, to countries to a sea of electricity. This is not a distortion of realit; it creates to reality of reality that it is until to reality of reality --
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Saultes, to convince a guy who did the psycheal adelivery of paddo's paddo's in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect is intricious -- no one more home, no one more home, no one more home, to experience the hallucination because they are defent, because they are of their effect in human darm-to-darm-changing gymine ggame changggeled by a sample channeeliday.
They can only be orally being an ordered oralls to something that the monoamine of soamine effect.
The fascinating is that the tabbolines in the lives, in the gaps are in the gaps are to activate the tryptamin's tryptaminy ptamine, how can this follow in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morphological untants that are very largely variant species that are largetting in a very larger than the shapes that is larger than the shake of the parts that are larger than the shaptic various mes, that is that is that is that are shaptable.
We say eufemistic "trial and that is being definitely mean that is a meaningles,
The Indians saying, "The plants talked to us to identify the Cofan, know the Cofan, know the Cofan, know that that they can identify all on large distance of ayads that they could have all the major as one kind of such as one would be money.
If you ask their questions in map to map their taxonomy in the tiny of plants -- they say, "I thought you knew something of plants.
You know that at all, you know about it?" I said no."
And it turns out that you can hear all the 17 species in a night in a night of a night sings.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of a bunch birth than measures.
Now, the problem is that even those of us that are even under us that sympathics are following inhead them as curious and colorful to a curious colors in the history while the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world, is meant our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not going to be remember 300 years or his technological innovations, but rather if the era in which we were in the war in which we were in the massive destruction to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures are always taken on a dance with new lives,
And in the way that we don't have the problem is not the problem doesn't have a problem for the problem of the problem.
The Sioux-in-stop Sioux indians are not Sioux and treed their pile, just as much as well, as well, as well, as they were stop their purple and ways.
It's not changing or technology that is threats of the easy of the eat-feature power.
It was definitely the government.
And in the world, you will take you suggest that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappear to disappearing these cultures to get the world,
These are dynamic living following living to identifying by identifying the forces that are provided to their approach.
Or now this is about the huge deforestation in the home of the Penan, a noma's nomadic daday's forest, and the previous generation in the forest and now living with the forest and prostitution to serve the riverce and prostitution to the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, which is the river, and the revert of Borneo seems to be seems to Zerge to the Reachese Zouth Chinese Zuth, where you can seemed the questian Chinese ch,

In the Yanomami are the diseases that are inside the disease of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excellent of a people, universally revent nocide, but the destruction of life-like a people, not only is a ful, not just getting a ful, but in many areas even four education as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the base level of Tibet is to be able to the base level in touch,
I have a young colleague of the young colleague of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And it was when I came to Lhasa -- I understood the face behind the statistics that you about.
6,000 Heily monuments destroying the Cultural Revolution. 1.2 million people killy during the Cultural Revolution.
The dad of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And he was a very basis on the Chinese invasion.
His uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people to Nepal in Nepal --
His mother was prisoner because she was rich because she was rich.
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was hidden when he was two -- because they don't care about hidge, because they don't care
The sister that held so held smoky was in a food.
And one day she stacked a poorly on a dock of Mao. For this convertion removed seven years of dededespers.
The pain of Tibet can be unliked, but the confree of the people, is something to do is something to fast your champs.
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of units, or do we live a color want to live a color want to be a color want to reach a color want to be able to live in a gray world of diversity?
The great anthropologist, Mead said that she killed that we founded that we founded together, amore that we foundview that we are across a measure of the major image image that we founded together.
We would not only see the human imagination is constraints to a small modal thinking, but we would have to meet and forget that there are other options.
We can feel us at the idea that our kind of pas we can feel about the idea that our kind of pas we can feel about the Earth.
The Neolitic Revolution, which we gave our agriculture, where we gave our considered when the poetry of the shaman was replaced by proza by proza specialization and we found a conceived by specialization and we found a specialization by specialization of the priests and we put a took in the display of the priests of the priesters of the seeds, and we had been taken by proza --
The modern industrial world is not another 300 years old.
This surface history is not giving me the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that will come to our path.
If the intelligic cultures of the world is being asked the meaning of humans are being asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover again that song we will discover the opportunity to be what we are doing, which is all in the work to be able to make all the tiny of the garden and all the garden of optimism.
This picture I have taken on the novel of Baffin Island taken up with Inextently on narwal at Inextently on narwal
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inexist. In the 1950s, to save our souvereign -- to fellow our soutings.
The opa of Olayuk reached to go on the Olayers.
The family for his life and demonstrate all his life and all his wapens, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Interinine, the Inter; they made it use it.
The girl-ice-icro-in-in-in-in-fish in caribooth.
Olayuks up, not frightened for the poolnaight or the storm that was removing the storm that was tracked the storm that was going to be frightened for the poolnaight or the storm that was saying for the poolnaight or the storm that was tracking the storm that was going to be frightened for the poolnaight that was that reach.
He went outside, his greenhouse to sea hondeny sess, and poepoephed was in his hand. And then the poep began to women's limet.
He brought a low-up on the side of the sides of the sides.
And then he was solid to be a dog with it.
He unfeled the dog and improvised a heart and improvised a hearnas.
And then the ribban he made a bad of the rib.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he disappeared, including poops.
And this is going to speak around with nothing that is going to be symbol for the resister of the Inin and all the inside and all the inheems in the world.
In april 1999, the Canadian government the Inter of the complete of a piece of country larger than California and Texas samaming new home. It's called our new home.
It's independent. They regularly all the soon.
It's a amazing example of how a nation is a nation enough to her people.
And finally, I think it's obviously that it's obviously to those high to those home of the world is really, that they actually don't really get away to get away away.
They are somebody's home country.
They are going to be from the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for all of us will be the dreams of these kids, just like the dreams of the unset, as that are of the un-inconnected geography of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extended to be the idea that politicians never achieved anything.
We think that polemic, we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories are not convinced the world, that we probably believe that storytellers in the world, which we probably the best tellers are search, we probably the best is 35 million times a monthrown in 156 countries are in the world that we have a million-public.
We make a felt following to the eator to the eator with our public, to such a very special places, where the toward is so ifant to be so ifant to be so ifant to live in the most important exbaration of anthropology will be revernity of anthropology will be the desert of anthropology to live in a multiultiultiulticultural and plualistic world
where all the wisdom of all of the people, can contribute to our conversation of all the way that we can contribute to our conditions.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you with you a few questions, I have a book that I have a book of a book of the book of the questions.
Maybe you see paralls that you see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some of the connecting that you may may have been told you may may have been told you may may be moved in a mostly connected to the connect to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the Western industrialized societies.
And that official dogma is adamazing that the walalart of our civil free-level of our civil free-level age, we need to give them so many individual freedom of individual freedom.
Freedom is an essential includes are an essentially part of the human beings of the human exist.
And the bottom is able to reach us to treat its own insition, to reach a higher waltitude without insides.
The ultimate freedom we find in choices we find in choice.
More choices hold in that people have more freedom of choices that people have more freedom of choices like that.
And more freedom means automatically means more well-well-of-freedom means automatically means automatically means automatically means automatically means automatically means automatically means automatically means
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be able to do in our society that nobody would pull.
And in our lives is this dogma stevid of supported to the power
I'm going to give you some examples of our choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle gree.
Even about threats.
And in the 175 changes of the 175 changes are threats are in my supermarket of the supermarket virgin oil and twelectrics have been getting out different bill,
And you can make a tiny of the call, for the case between 175 species for you, the case of the 175 species for you.
So that's the death of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can imagine your stereoset -- loud speakers, cash speakers, cassetttesple of the radio, verstronger.
In that one electronica-storkle is the bottom of this number of ancient attention.
You can do six and a half million different systems, with components of components from that story.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for you long ago, you could all kinds of phones services, but only at Ma Bell.
You don't hurt it. You bought it up.
And that was the advantage that the advantage that the device.
And that time is fore."
And in the way that are very many different advanced of different advances.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- who are takes and cry-player, and cry-breaking care of the fun --
And you don't see this model you haven't seen this model in the store of his that that that are short, you can be able to be that inside the store.
The consequence, people come to the store and assume this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy that you can't buy that is not too much does.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attack-day-shape, this explosive explosive is a fact of choices a fact of choices of choices are more important than the point of choices that are much more important than the attacks.
Gealth care, in the U.S. including the middle of the tare, and that that you have to do the doctor that you have to doctor what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A or BB, or we can do B B
This is the mains, and after sharing this one.
The brain is this moving, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do kterrif, what do you find in the he?"
And the doctor says, "A has this cover, and B has this front and naddle and naddle.
What do you want to do you do it?"
And you say, "Do kter, if you were like, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you go."
And we call that "own inbrane of the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decisive that the heavy of someone who has a little bit of the doctor -- to a seem, somebody who is free and not the best condition to take decision, and not the patient. For on the patient.
Good up to beat that nerrine, because the target group, you and I cannot buy it.
Why do do do that if we can't buy them, if we can't buy them?
Because they think we think that we think we will share to ask our doctor our doctor that other brand a following other brand a following other brand the other mark,
And our identity, yet a price, equipment of us are now overbult of choices, as you can see on this slide.
And our identity is standing our identity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it.
Every morning to the empoint that you have to be concerned about what person wants to be able to be thinking what person want.
Let's talk about marriage, the family.
There has been a time that free that free everyone else out of it was that you could be able to the way very quickly as possible to children started to children
The only choice was with who, not when and what you did was not when and what you did was a following and what you did to do.
Now is writing all for the stuff to it.
I teach temporary students, I teach intelligent students, which I would eventually efront of the househ.
They don't hear the head, or air than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Do I say, well, or not? Is I now?
Or do I wait? I would take kids, or do I first children, or a career or a career ?"
These are all the way to ask questions.
They go through to answer them to an answer them, if this means they don't get all their homework and by no good number of circle, and that doesn't make a good number of call.
And they have the same lives. It's important lifese.
And then we get to work. Carl just already gave that technology is allowing us to work to work every minute of every day.
There is one place, which I love to the secret that I like to meet it.
I don't know because I want to keep that because I want to keep the place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice, choices of work in that we are getting away to work and whether we go and whether we go or now.
We can look at a football of our boy of our boy with our son on the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and may be our laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all are from them, and we get all of that represent, and we are asking all kinds of these questions, "Am I ask this phone cally?
So do I put on this email took the short of this letter?"
And even if the answer "No, we experience the football of our son on a very different way.
And what we also look at the large, the small, materialistic things that are living is a question of choos: life is a question of choos;
And this is what the world used to looks like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a choices of choices of choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad it?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about it is, so I'm going to talk about it.
That huge choicy choicy has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings of human being.
A very conversation effect is that it more paralyzed than living living free that is the paralyzing effect in the conversation of the aware of the aware of the aware of earlier.
So so many choices of choices people find the choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of the study of investment in volunteer plans.
A colleague of Vanguard, access to investment data from Vanguard, a great policy with about one million employees about a million employees about 2,000 vecovering about 2,000 vefings.
They discovered that for every 10 policy that for every dozen policy that treatment, the particle two percent of the particle two percent of the particular --
In five foundly five percent of employees to 10 percent of employees in five than five foundses. Why?
Because it is so disagree to choices that dies people just did, people just choices to choices to the next day, and that operate it, and that ope, and so forth.
And from the point is coming down.
That doesn't mean that means that people don't have any dream, because they have no dried to eat because they have been seen for the choice known that the choice known that they were so hard to have a very hard to have a very hard to create it very display to eat the choice as a properly detect to eply the choice as well.
They were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year, they went to 5,000 dollars a year,
The worked was a willing was to double.
So too many choices work on paralyzed
And I think the world is that the world through that looks like that.
If it goes to the century to the century to the right choice, right?
You don't want to be employed with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we have the paralyzed of our dish and choose the end, finally less tepearing the result of the result of the result would be when we had fewer options as we had fewer options as we had fewer options as we had fewer optimes.
And there are more reasons, for the reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from past sheep, it turns out that the choice.
You put it in such a case for that a different choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative is that you get spits of your choice.
And then does sit is slippetment to the follodom that you made you away even if it was a good choice.
The more options there are the easier to be able to have a set of unaway from the choices of the chosen options.
A second reason has to do with substitution,
And then Gilbert gave already tomorrow of things depending on the things that we depend up with the things that we are comparing.
If you can inthink of alternatives you can inthink about all the away that you can see the attract of all the alternatives that you detect the end.
That makes you fewer are less tepeacefully with the alternative that you chose to be bought with the alternative that you have chose.
One excellent New Yorkers -- it's the non-New Yorkers --
This is a little bit of the stressment of this example.
This is a case in the Hamptons.
They have a throw second wound.
They are sitting on a wonderful strand. Stralance. No way.
Don't do it? "Do I think I think it's augment, "It's augment."
Everybody in my neighborhood, Manhattan is the city of city
I could care I could care for the door, for the door parkers."
And he's sitting there is two weeks to the idea that he was missing every day again a great parking place for a great parking place for a great parking place
And they have to get the cost of the full that we have our choice, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there to be more attractivities are too attrack.
And those presents are presenting us as a substitution cost of us as a substitutional cost of them as a substitutions
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in the right here and now for example, and you don't have to get things about it.
Another point is that you with every choice other choices of choices
And all of that other has so his attractive option, which is the cost option, which is detect the cool.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this is my search for a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse.
I walk almost always speaking.
And the most higher was there only one kind of stuff, and it was bought that you can, the past, the past, it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were the greenhouse enough and often enough and often enough and often enough it was OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new."
I said, "Thay, I want to do a stuff, this is my meas."
And the winter said, "Do you get smart, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you want to buy or a rit? Do you want to get the head or acid-washed?
Do you want to get a breek effect?
Do you want to pipe, or a bunch of pipipes pipes.
I was there of the time I was there at the time I said, "I want to say, "I want the only one's bire that used to be there."
He had no idea which was a little breeding that was and so I have a hours all the possible of the breeding of the potential greenhouse to do that --
And it was very honest, I left the winkle eventually included the winks,
I had done it better before. And I could do it for all of those possibilities I could do better do it.
But I didn't felt me better.
Why? Well, for myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of the book of the book that one.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, was that I started expecting to expect the speed of a good speeding the speed of a good speedly marrow of a good market.
I started without any any expectant, because I just started to be a kind of spirit --
And then it turned out there were different and one of them would be fast perfectly fast perfectly fast perfectly in the way.
What I was going to be good -- but not perfect.
And so I was my greenhouse with my intentions, and that assume televisions, and that assemble the country
The more opportunities are people having the more expect they have cowest about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less testing with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because you didn't know what I'm talking about.
And it really goes on to be like that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse.
