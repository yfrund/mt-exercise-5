And I was a year I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, which the pool, who had about the size of the VS, had 40 percent of the United States, with 40-percent of the United States.
But this is actually the record of this particular problem because it doesn't show the didness of the ice of the ice of ice that ice shows the didness.
The ice of ice on the North Pole is in a sense, in a sense, sing heart of our global climate system.
It set out in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and so.
The next slide that I shows is a quickly version of what the last 25 years is happening about the last 25 years is happening.
The permanently permanmanent ice is dissed.
As you see, set it out of dark blue.
That's the year, the major of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer of the summer
The so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like blood is almost like blood that from the body is soil.
In 25 years is the one of this to this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icrazy and it was a very large amount of woman, and there is a very large amount of carbon is the death of meth, when it was methane.
And the deal with the total amount of demospher, that could describe that that could describe that could describe as we considered the point of point to describe the surround.
In some indepth of undeep in Alaska break of the water.
And the last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different ondissed.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is to be that will be that will be that will be going to be that will be that will be that will be that will be right.
A reason for that is this huge of warmer is that this huge of the north,
This is a meltwater river.
The watervolume is echer than echer than eat the water-up.
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sespeal is because it takes the landyes, it's the place where the sea.
These stroming these flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on the earth.
And the last month ratorted, scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice of the global conduct is it.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly to the south of the south of water-water-water-both underwatery.
The whole continent is to six meter sea sespiece of sea of sea of sea
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice massa, there are new now, which is a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drein-water.
In the Andes, this glester the source of drink water for this city.
There are more strows.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow, in the snow,
It comes to get in the waterreservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are going to be there.
This global dreams has been ago to a dramatic style of foods.
And the number of course, the whole world is spent with an incredible and never seen a speed.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton on CO2 a.S.
25 miles ton every single day, in our ocean, at the east area of the Stille Ocean, from America, we get from America, we have been a behavior, and every single siling from the Indian subcontinent of the ocean in the ocean in the oceans.
The only great causes of the Earth, is the earth, which is the regular for 20 percent of the Earth, is the sources of fossil fuel stones.
Oil is a problem, and step is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extincluding with China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more support carbon centrales.
But we see a circle of all.
These are the support carbon that the ban was annuated in the last last years, and where green alternatives were annuation forward forward.
There's a political streedoming to the gang in our country.
The urban carbon and oil industry gave form of 250 million dollars to promote "shops to promot," which is a contradictions.
And that image was doing something like something like this.
And the guy was at me at the home in Tennessee, about four billion literacial model.
You probably seen it probably in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news in the news of the news in the news of the news in the news of the news
This is the one after one after one after one after the greatest disilure.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the adversing of the support left around the Kerster was this:
Video: ""Frosty the voice, a key bed guy.
He is fluence about this is fluence here in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the support carbon is screen.
He was paid and wood, and they keep their battacks.
Here is a large part of the big, in West Virginia of Virginia of froms.
The biggest mines of the country is the great bath of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know what they haven't know about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on your mind.
This is a piece from a piece of a replace.
Video "Bue COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat, for our business for our business for our business for our business for our business for our business for our business of the climate change for our business to our business for our business for our
That's why the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a giant to give a gigantic to reward the light and bring the true of truth and the reward of the truth of value carbon.
Feit is, the balance is not smary.
We find that the shop, and it still is -- and it still seems up.
So, you don't make worry about climate change about climate change
Let that only is about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shells on the hyperformance of carbon centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are best making is a little lai.
But that's the sound of shone of shoot technology.
And despite the fact that the branes of steads of the main order of the Earth, the Earth is the remarkable technology that you see all the time.
Look at the beautiful technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative security of national safe.
Video: Stem: My America in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The road wireless is our dependence of fossil fuel several fuel stones, like the vile cols and healthy is:
But now there's a purposing new solution to get out of this.
Forth America of 100 percent scene, in 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to the work on the work of the Earth, and the option of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth contract.
And so that we have a solution that enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our took how to do it.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: I, It's about about America to give America is to give America is to give America
One of the speed ways to make a end of our dependence of old fuel of old fuel straight shapes that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Nieue investments to create good paid good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speaking, "If you want to be all the way you get all the time.
If you want to go far far far abou."
We need to go far far away and fast.
Thank you.
And I was an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reward back to a update about how that machine works.
So I am a lot of those who didn't waren: The LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ended to be underneath in the entertained in the enable.
It must have to be the circumstances that were less than a billion after a billion after the universe that the universe began to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, d!
This is the machine under Genery.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the gene I work. It is called ATLAS detector -- 44 meters.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attacular so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That is that for a partnerships.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that hell around the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, value with a piece of the LHC, value shares in the detector of the detector of the detector of the detector of the LHC, which was a picture of the LHC, which was a
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine words, which is a huge conversation is a huge consider.
I don't know if this the biggest across or this when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet page of it looked like this.
That means we made a kind of cultural as a scientific impacts of impact.
And one week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden behaviors.
They were 13 thousand of these balance when the machine on the entire powered to work.
The engineers will say, "Not true will say, "Not true.
They can do that because they can do superaged to be on very lower temperaturps.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars that can be adapted ago that beyond the behavior.
In one of the connections between the neine of the neine of the nets in the LHC, sat a constructivity.
And it was the wire was a hearmer, and it was intended to that 13 thousand of that 13 thousand ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that that that the magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the magnets are place.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of it, what we did we did it.
We all have been repaird.
Now they are back on the way.
Eind murbs will be the LHC again,
We will be able to expect it and we expect measures in juni or so we can go and look at the extend of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, that have been incidentally reincluding the value of scientific research of scientific research.
I think the fact that it's so hard is so hard, the fact that we go further than the LHC.
I showing the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have been determined to deal of the values of values of the values of values are learning, his teachers of his teachers are not a dangerous for the most examples of human mind to take the images of human mind that our images of science that we don't have have have a world of the mysteries of course that we have no new world -- that there are no new new neath of course that are not have to discushead in the new new world in the world -- that there are not have no new world of course of course of course that there are not have no new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new world of course that
Thank you.
I would like to ask you back to to your children back to your children at your children at your children at the time, when you play.
When you found how you had to put it up to grab and consciousness and dealing to the teach and deal with the environmental relations.
Rut, review is a strong is astrong because with the world to understand the world to understand the world to us.
If an information is inspired by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- with my adviseur Pattment and my fashion Jeed.
and as we can ordering as we want to do it?
This question of us so so that we decided to find an answer by the building of Siftables.
Cort involved is a Siftable computer is an interactive computer on a cows.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together their movement, their movements and they felt a screen and they get a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands are going to be allowed by grabities to graduate it by grabs.
And the top of the Siftables a new example of a new ecosystem for digital information.
And that these helping means a more physical different, are awareness of their movement, and even from each other, and even of the way we move them to discover and nature these new and nature interactions.
I will start with some simple example examples of examples.
This Siftable is insted to tell a video to tell a video and provide to be able to tell you and others to be a crazy.
These interactive portraits of consciousness of each other.
Indians are put together, they will be interest to each other.
If they become rings and they also can also be able to become some nenway.
And they feel they move and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting consequences of these interaction, the use of the interaction, as it challenge of a color as it was a fluid as it was a fluid of a fluid of the wood.
In this example of straight Sifttacks for and I can use them to go and I can use them to go and put them into a very long time to go and get them to be ment.
If we have been threat, we went back to the little back.
There are some of a few knapple of the education, especially played with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people people to give the possibility things that we want to give people to see the possibility of immediately well.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci series through a simple reknowledge programative programative matter.
Here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the runs on every Siftable, and dangered words are controlllling words are in a dictionary.
After 30 seconds is the very rescue, and differently a new series of letters with a very heard.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the way it and I did it and make a video of it.
They were actually actually actually actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost not nearly instructions need.
All of what you have to say is "Mo's word," and they know what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the testing of the people at it.
That's our youngest ber is the right.
And it seems that he was just the Siftables living up.
For him this was just blocks.
Here is an interactive paintings toward a little bit of the interactive of it.
We wanted to learn a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstration.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by the Sifable with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done of Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the near of Siftaper and they can response to do with each other, Video: Wa!
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end.
and he decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat fly fly away.
DM: The last example that I will show you today Is a synthesizer and life, that we developed development, where every Siftables like the lead, bass like the lead, as the lead, bass and pressure pressuming and pressure pressure and pressed.
Eentire variation, where you can choose what you want to use which you to use which you want.
These sounds can be injected in the very injected so you can determined to determined it to determined the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern Siftables can determined in the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern it
You put a sound in the pattern by the attacks of a lower Siftable effects of a lower effects of the reverb as reverb and filter.
They are being able to a sound and progression by the changed and access.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern of pattern effects like tempo and volume that are being applied on the whole pattern effects like tempo and volume that are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start with a liad of leads, to a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern by a lead.
Now I read the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: Now I feed a little batch of slaging.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter of the filter of the press, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can get it to accelerating the office of the tempo blocky.
Video: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what is more expression.
Video: DM: I can reach the pattern as it play.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise it to improvise and shorter as I want to do it.
And finally the dimp of the dimp of the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to be able to do the left.
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion is going to make new human-computer interfaces that are indeed in the way our brain and bodies are working on the way our brain and bodies.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of the ability that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attack is to a very new generation of help in the interacts for the interacting with digital media, which is the information to our world like we want.
I thank you to do it.
I look at it out to talk to you to all of you to talk to you.
I'm writing.
But, my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life I am writing for a long time and I don't think that will change change that will change change that will change change
And yet, there is an away that happened in my life and career in my life and career with my work on my work on my work on the work on my work on the work on the time.
It started with a book that I wrote undes that I wrote a memoire: "Ets, Bemergency to my first work in contratradiction to my first work around the world was going to be an international exist.
The sequence is that people all over and always do me as if I did do do do that.
And the thing -- the member.
People come to me and questions are going to give you you you to do this success you will never be able to evenar?
Do you don't afafraid you will keep writing your whole life will be able to do that people have to do for people that people to get to write for warm.
Don't you get to be a job?"
And the rigerate, you know you.
Of course, that would be very much. But I remember that I was a little bit about 20 years ago, I was when I told I was a teenager.
People said, "Do you have never been able to get succes?
Do you don't afraid for education, that you will be able to such up?
Do you don't afafraid you will be able to this work is that there is something out of the things that there are going to be on the puin of your buildings on the puin of your buildings with your mond bit?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short comes to this question on this novely is on this novely is to say, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough that are enough to be enough that are enough things.
Also, already already already already.
But I'm also a lot of other things band, you don't know what all of the things for all of the time.
For sea wear whose for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time is that the last time is that the angst of what the angst of the last time is going to be a from.
Is the rational?
Is it it logical that somebody is going to be bang for the work for their mention on Earth?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mindness system, something about about it.
Take my father. He was shop, and I can't remember me that there was in the 40 years that he worked on the 40 years that he worked on him has been asked to him that was not afraid for him.
And so that is what is it to you chemistrackade?"
No, so it was not about it.
To fair be: score, argumentation have been by the centuries through the centuries of the century reputation for piece of manical depressive alone.
Scheat, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, also other creative people have been instable, the reputation of human beings are instable.
And look at the grim of the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
And many stierves young, often by own own applicating.
And even those who don't have a self-suician suician under their gave to be concerned their gave to be concerned their gave to be concerned their gave ord.
In the last interview for his death said, "Meat was a piece of my books is a piece of myself was a piece of mitry."
That's quite a little bit about saying about your life.
But of these kind of exactly looking at the time.
We all heard the first one heard and have it all the time.
The hemissing thought, that creativity is that creativity is unlost of the list and that a artists will read to celerate the access of the celerator tacks.
So I want to ask everyone here today I think that idea is the idea of living to life that idea is living the idea of living to the idea of life.
Do you like that.
Because I'm going to think about it, I think about it I don't think about it all the way I don't know a very good day.
I think the weather sense of the reader of mind.
And also even more dangerous.
I don't like to see that this this century.
We can creative mind to live much better attacks.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, for that dark to that dark to that dark to that dark in my mind.
Some of the fase that my career is in my career is now in the fase in which is now in the fase in which is now in the fase in which is now in the fase in which is now now in the fase in which is the fase in which is now in the fase in which my career on in which my career is
Go but I have a young, amper teach.
I can do another four decade in the decades.
And the thing is probably all the way that I now now now have been seen by the outside world as the work that is that extraordinary book.
So we are with friends under each other, so I can sell it is the explaining is my greatest success is to me.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think of the morning, you know the morning, you know the morning, all of the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love me of the work that I love me that I love the work that I love to the work that I love the work that I love to the work that I love me of work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
After long after time I think I can just go to the conclusion that I can just go with writing a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process involved in the process inbuilt.
I have to see the writing of the distance distance between mistence, and my survive and my survive to the reactions, and my very understanding the reactions.
I was looking at the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of history, and I deep me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others a better way to help people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search toward me to the old Greies:
And let up, because it's a long and including story.
In the time of the old Greies: and Romenon and Romenon who was from henself.
Men believed that creativity was a godd-mind place, which was a dealthy to the human reasonable place.
The Gries: The Greiefs of creativity "demonen."
And not Socrates believed he was a demon that he had an demon that we influistence.
The Romenon had a species of idea.
And if they have been such a guy creative mind creative mind.
The gray is that the Roman is not a genius with a genius to be a particular pience.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical godal entities that was hiddal in the waller of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs by the house of the househ.
If the artists was to the work was read assistention.
And he gave he gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first of the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you was brilliant was not all the eat.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genious genius you had healthy.
Where's the work is crowd, you know, it doesn't just like you to do it.
Everybody knew that you had a rather indepenguy genion.
Lange time is that had been proted.
When the Renaissance, and everything else.
There was a very new idea: the individual human is the individual ments is the middle of the universe and the mysteries.
No space for mystical beings, intend from the godd-studirty world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual for.
And for the first time in history was about artists that they were saying that they were not to be a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genie.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a great front of it.
And to show one person, one one one individual individual that he or they have the fight-hand the essentially mysterion, the source of the century of everything that creative and the known consider to a lot of responsibility for a fragility for a fragile of fragile human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun of the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun.
Egos are building up to gigantic proporations and there are improvide to prestate prestative to prestate prestative to prestate in the time.
And I think this drug has made a lot of artists of artists has made a lot of artists
If that is, and I think that is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old understanding of the relationship between the relationship and the creative mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterio?
Maybe not a lot of maybe not a lot of it.
And we can do 500 years of rational humanism not until in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speed.
And the probably of the audience people who are reverse scientific scientific doubs about the idea that elphysical weather working with some partment of artists to inspiring arries to inspiring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get to get you in the time.
And I walk me up.
Why isn't it?
Why would we have not to do that thought?
It is just so much as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally include unclearns that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have been trying to create -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, you know, the creative process is not always rationally done is not always rationally rationally done is not always rationally rationally rationally rations.
And that it sometimes it is almost paranorms.
I have been the great American dichers, Ruth Stone is Ruth Stone is
She's she's close in the negentig. Her all life they did.
She told me about her youth on the platand of Virginia.
Some of them when she was on the felt of the work was felt to the country.
It was so so she said, as if there was a great wave air came out of air came out of the air of the wave air
And so, the golfed than the country to her apply the country to her apart.
And she felt that the ground under her feet began to do that her at that moment and knew that her at that moment but one thing to do is to be a life's lives.
And she ran to home, and they had to get the close and they had to do as quickly as possible and then they see paper and paper and paper and paper and they had to do it.
When the close of the poem came up through her hunt that her only chance to write it on to write it on the point to write it up with the golves to write it on the waves to write it on the hunt of the power to write it on the point of the purpose to write it up by writing her only was that her only to write
Sometimes they didn't quickly enough.
Then sokay, but calculate it not.
And in the time is shoot the poem of her him, and the push -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another soon.
And then I think that it was a lot of -- this I think the beautiful part of the story -- they were the close to almost miste.
And then she was seeing up and paper and paper, and the paper and the paper and the paper and so.
Just at that moment she had a potately, she had a potately.
And with her other hand, so told me so, they told me so, they were close to the purpose of the air.
She paked it to his tail, and it back into her body, and it back in her body, as they wrote it.
And in that cases came up to the close of the mind that in sat at paper, but then they were in the end, but then in the end.
When I heard that I thought -- what I think is so away.
This is what my creative process no! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which is a mouse on the same time on the same time and contains with blood, sk and they were through blood.
But even in that days I had been such a experience.
You will also know it also knowledge, that sense that there is a sense of the source of a source of a source of a source of a source of the source of a source of the source of a source of a source that you can identify.
What is that then is that for brone?
How can we use it without that we bee?
And on a way that isn't that good for us to is?
The best contemporages example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time of a while,
We had this go.
Tom is a big part of his life is a large part of his life is the showed of the contemporary artists that are tries to get out of all the power to get on the unconnection to get to impulse in him.
And the 190s was Tom some rustant
And one day, he read in Los Angeles on the fast beard, and changed the process of radical radical radicy.
And as he heard there, he heard a fragmentally of a melodie.
The decision is the inspiration that does deal is debbable, until right.
It was a beautiful melods and he wanted it to vasement.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have no paper at a paint, no tane; he had to see a tangle.
The well-exciting spance of the conclude of the melody of the melody and then keep me me equipment.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panick, but he didn't stop the pathing, but he stops all the mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry heard, you can't see that I sat at the point?"
"Do you really really do that I can write a song?
If you really want to do that this song of coming out and even more than I have to do that, you have to do when I have time for you.
Don't go to somebody else fall.
Go neighbors at Leonard Coh." And from that time love the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of course.
And the work is the same thing with the known known dge dark is the dark of the dark of the dark is the sadark is the same dark is the same dark is the same dark of the dark is still the dar
But the sware exciting that the creative process in him of him represented to distant destith,
The geniy was to close on the skin and living only calling up.
And so that there was no reason there was no reason to go.
It could also be a wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and the own, and the ownerable aspect that not all of Tom itself.
That story has my way of work.
I had been profit of profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddomins. Biddoms.
And I give you a little bit of point.
You know that you don't want to work but not good to do it and you think it is a terrible disaster is worth a terrible book it.
Not summer bad is really terrible bad bad bad bad bad and bad it.
I wanted to do the whole project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are who was going to be genius and I also decided to way.
I was going to go from my manuscrips and direct me to a very much.
And I said, "Lister thoperation, we know all the way that if this book is not only because it's not only by me.
You can see that I think I have in what I in the front of what I have in me.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better to do it better than you have to do your thing.
Snap you don't do that, thank you very much.
I just write because that's a lot of my work.
Oh, and in the notile that are being contained that you today is just a differently.
Tja--- Usent comes up here on this novely is to be on this novely is the novely of the time.
Every ewen ago, there were in the North African desert people together to desert in the North music.
And the hours and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always wonderful, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes happened to be something extraordinary.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, I mean, you know, you ever seen that you ever seen something like a performer.
It was like the time was the time and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He didn't did nothing else than the thousands of nights and now everything together.
And it doesn't look at a long time he didn't just longer just a human beings.
In him, under him of him is him glous.
A godnment, a godnment.
If something called the studied happened to people what it was Dan they started to clap and in the flah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice of historical fact, when the Mors Spainting Spainting Spainting these living beautiful with it.
The extent is echer by the centuries of "Allah, Allah." "Allah." "Ollet Allah."
That you know, you today the day's still flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flamen
If an artists in Spain something unpossible or magical goes, "Allah, oh, oh, oh, all the time, Allah, Allah, Allah, w."
And the way it is a glimp of God.
And the resisted what we need.
Lasty is the dance that the dance the next morning, and the next morning, he found out that he was to expect 11 hours don't have godd-ladge lady.
And on that moment he is a little eldere man with debate with debad that will never come to such a lot of such will be able to such a lot of parent.
Maybe there will never be somebody else to be somebody else will be danced to dances.
What does it have to be with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to selling for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be the point.
Imagine that you don't know that the most unusues of your person aspects of your person from yourself.
Imagine that you believe that you have a time to be a time to specifically sent letter of a source of a source of a source of a source of a long time
When you get ready with it, they are given to somebody else on somebody else.
And so it is all the way to be all of the time.
I handle incentive that thought I was doing the mind that thought.
The last months I've been working on a book that will be short to be different. The book where a lot of regular.
The operating that illuster progression progression.
If my mind to me with me to the hall, I keep me the same for: I don't know bang.
Do just you work.
For just you just do this: which is also it is.
If you go to dance your job, thank you to dance you.
If the godd-genius that you have been decided to decide in your work on at some time of the wonderful source of the wonderful sources -- "Olen!"
And the thing that doesn't though then, then, this: Thank you.
And also this: "Olen!"
I believe that I believe that I think is hard.
"Olet me how it is because we can keep human love and propertility toward and propertissue by plums.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olen!
You know, I've had been talking about some of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome, and what that can mean and discovered from genes.
We actually actually actually actually from a new point, we were the digital of the digital issues, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new fase in the biology -- and synthesizing to design and synthesizing the design of life.
So we always tried to ask the great questions to ask the great question.
"What is living is something that I think about what a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of biolos in different level.
We tried to get different approaches back to minimal components.
We're now now now now about 20 years to the digital is to digitalize.
When we look at the human genome called the human genome is the analoge world of the analoge world of the computer.
Now we are we trying to ask life is we can create regeneral, or we create new life from this digital universe is we create to do new universe of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome, with the tiny genome, in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we have tried to a nature genome.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or whose there are there.
But if we look at the metabolical ma, that's relative is that relative to the insoon.
Gelve me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can cheat the genes that this is very unliving cell that this would be a living cell that this would be surprising to the genes that we can reach a living cell the genes that we can do a living cell the genes that would be a living cell the genes that would be a living cell the gen
We decided to synthesize that the only route to synthesize this chromosome, so we could deal with components to do the components to do the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we started to ask a chromosomm synthesis?
Staat the chemistry it to make these very large molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, a chromosome, "e?
A chromosomm is but a piece of chemicically inces material.
So, our tempo of digitals of digitize of life is requirement.
Our ability to write the genetic code of writing rather slowly slowed as well, but is a connect of the genetical code
And our last point it would put on this moment on this point on an exponential curve.
We're starting to be more than 15 years ago.
There were some of a couple of stage for a bio-ethic acts of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard.
There are tiends thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA maks, 30 to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how much more front of it.
So we had to make a new method for the tiny of these little pieces and the corrigerate of all the front of all the front of the front of all the front of these little pieces of the purpose of the parents of the parents of all the front of these little pieces of the front of these little pieces of
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome,
That's a small soil that bacteria die.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the bacteria piece of chemical stant in the bacteria and the bacteria and the bacteria genetions and virtually make the genetical particles and virtual particles and make these viral particles and make these bacteria piece of the bacteria tand,
The viral particles were when they were solved from the cells, they came back and they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was unfortune with the oil industry, and I said they move that model but I said they move to well.
They laughing more than you.
So we think this situation is a situation that the software are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettttile of viruses, so we could various the cassettttile --
to understand what the deal components of a living cell of a living cell cell to be a living cell to understand what the cell is the deaths of a living cell cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that must be very accuraft is very accuraft very accurament.
When we first first this genome for the first time was in 1995 was the standard-precision one front of a 10,000 basepares.
And finally we found after resequencing 30 olents. If we had the original sequence than it was not going to be able to start to be able to start to starting to do it.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to contravel with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so much as a lot of building so they have to design so they can design so they have to design so they can go together so they can go together.
We design here unique design design in the spire of design in the time.
Maybe you have been adaped that we stop in the watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-literally called a four-genetic code: A, Go and T.
Trios of those letters for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attaction is a very simple attacks.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words to write words to write words to write words,
And we actually signment, we just asked about it.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no purpose to be no mind.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairs and together together.
And we started to make pieces of making pieces that five to 7,000 letters for 7,000 letters for 7,000 letters and you have a lot of 24,000 letter, and you have a lot of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every city of the crazy of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process that very robs is very robuy -- that will be very robuying you -- that will see you see sequences -- that will see you see.
We try to do it from automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow so much more than 100,000 based.
That is the outside of all modern tools of the modern distant of molecular biology.
So we went to read with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombine is used by the biology to repair DNA to repairs, that pieces can feet of so.
Here is an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinococcus radiation that three million radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the side.
And that you see in the top panel, sheat mosome.
12 ots 24 hours later he was going to go into each other, exactly like the first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that these around.
These organisms can be completely did.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be in space, that can find out of the space, which can find is a new environment.
NASA has been a lot of the way, that there is much of the outside.
Here is a very extraordinary microphy that we made with this processes -- actually actually made with these processes -- actually actually actually with the right designs with the right design.
But, for that they feel that they feel automatically food.
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences that we spent inside.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuged is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without a spative pages of the genetic code is only to pressure.
Now, how do we starting to a chromosome? How do we remember it?
And with a virus is the clearly pretty easy.
And it is a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you an eukaryots, like wis: you know whose you just know the celkern and do some other in, and that's what you know as it is what you know when it is what you know if it is the reading ones.
And when you see the bacteria is the chromosome, but we have been integrated in the cell, but we have to show that we can see a full transpline of a chromosomic mosome, and it can explain a cell to a different, and it can be a cell to a different and the activity of a cell mosom of a cell mosome.
We have a chromosoxygen of a micro-species.
These are about so far from each otherwise as people and mics.
We add some extra genes so we could select for this chromosome.
We have been asked with enzymes to make all the equipment.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be very advanced graphic imagery here -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to set it come to set it out of the process what is going to be a process what is going to be able to develop the process of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a third chromosome, which they were thousands of them in one time in one time to the species.
People who are exposed to be one to have a lot of biology has not been a lot of biology has been been crazy.
There are enzymes that restricti-enzymes that are actually enzyms that are really DNA is detaks.
The chromosomm that was not to eat.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop,
It was expressive, and the recognize the other chromosome, and so we had the cell of the material, and so we only had the cell we only had the cell mosom.
He was a blue of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time awed all the characteristics of one species, and he was completely in the new species, based on the new software that we stop.
All the gallens, the membranes -- when we changed the genetical code was changed.
This is a clinks like genomics alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things that are DNA, to change things fundamentally change
Good, I paid that this is not a shoot -- this is a shoot -- this is prebord-heart for 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid paid that we may be almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambranch on this digital design is to this digital design is to this digital design is to be able design in this digital design is to be a new species,
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly clearly when you look at what it needs is to what it is.
We're going to go into ses-a-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet.
for each of us that that in 1946; within 1940 years that there are four are four there.
We have to do with food, with the conceiving, medicine, medicine, medicine, for the ses-a-half billion.
That's really getting to do that for neine to do that for negars.
We use five billion ton collemess, more than 30 billion ves.
That's 100 miloons of vessentially fellow out of the time.
When we take biological processes in ogency or which is also to replace, or which is going to be a huge challenge of challenge challenge of challenge.
Then of course, that carbon dioxide of the stone that comes in the atmosphere is really coming in the atmosphere is really going to be able to be there.
And for all of our worldwides we have now now a database with about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is from there is forward from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the electronics that from the diversity that is from the different components, and you look at the diversity that is that from the diversity of the electronentttissue of the elec
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques dancing that they have a technithesemethods to do so called combination genomics to do so much.
We now have the opportunity to build a great robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes of the conversation of them or tries to make processes to make or medicine or medicine or medicine or medicine or medicine, we can change with a little team of molecular biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can select for living vatbalthy, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real design design software where we working on the gang and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design kind of a computer of the computer of the computer of what is a screen of the computer of the bad of the bad of the boundation of what is a screen of the real design kind of what we can design is to work, so you can design and design a new kind of what we actually can design kind of work, and you can design and actually design kind of work on the bigger in design kind of work,
We don't know person how it will see out of the point of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We focus on fourth generation of fuel stones.
And the one of you have seen to ethanol anol of the things that are just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugar, like sugar, to more high and more high fuel stones like octan ockable species of butano.
But the only way we think we think that biology big influence is a lot of food price and the describes and the describbbby-regarnment is as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are inside the food that we think we are the first four of generation and we think we are the first generation of the mind generation of 18 months.
And sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwide discovery stot, we have all kinds of other methos.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the depth of the depth of the depth of depth with coals.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular waterstant as energy sources as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take to take it and we can take a pipipipipipipid to fabried, where that CO2 to fabrace, which is going to be this process.
So in a short time is we think we are able to think we are able to break on the basal question: "What is living life is?"
We have realize you know -- you know, the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where you can do, where you can do, where?
A important energy source become a major of energy source of energy source.
But we're also using this working on these tools to think about fastle series to think series to think about faster vaccines to think of these tools.
This year was the gricultural we always have a little bit behind the facts of the parts on the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the textomority by creating vaccines of the forest
And here you see how the future can see what the future is going to change the evolution tree, the required of evolution with synthetic bacteria and eventually eukaryota.
We are still away from people.
Our goal is certainly to survive we make a chance to surviviolate that we can do that well. Thank you.
What I want to show you as a quickly is the fundamental of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft to Microsoft this is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surroundin which you can work on the distance of the amounts of visual data can work.
We look at the time, we look at digital images and can be here on the way and can be on the stay and extinctions and extincluding the sors and the sorts to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information or imagery.
Most of this normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixle of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the Library of the
It all makes not all of because the only thing that would be influence, the amount of the way to be influence, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, an example of non-imagined imagine.
This is the graug house through Dickens. Eli colim is a headvantage piece.
And to evidence that it is really textest is, and not imagination, we can do something that this really is a really textest issue.
Maybe this is this a strange of strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't do it it to me.
This is a realistically, example of this is an example.
Every big image image is the beginning of a bottom.
This is really a lot of the experience of a real paper of a real papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is actually a scale medium is.
We also have been done something that we have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have made a nep adversed of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have information -- and we have inft.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can actually do for the constraines of hands through the bears of trade via the screen to do the screen to do it.
We hope this is not a pop-ups more means and other third flaul -- not need more than not needed to be more than it is going to be more than it to be more more meaningful flaul -- not need more means and other third flaul -- not news.
Of course, the agrands are a map for a technology like this, for a technology like thise, I will spend up here is a time to spend up to this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of a imagination of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques connected with each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision of Noah Snavely, promoso on the University of Washington, ago from Washington, ago on University on University on University on University on University on University of Washington,
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's measured by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this -- we can see through the imagery and the multi-resolution.
The space shouldn't have the imagery.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together so they are considered to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are.
I don't know sure or there is another time is another environments.
There are still a lot of space to.
I want to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynthesses -- to the environmental working -- to the the communicate of this summer is the realization of these environment, to look at the survive force of the environments on our website.
We had to do regular with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the on-shirts and the campus and equal campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dame is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame is a reconstruction of the Notre Daffect of the Notre Donstruction of the Notre Dones in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs a imagination again, which is part of this model of model that turned out to be part of this model of this model --
And so these are all these Flickr imagines, which are in this way of room are going to be contemporary imaginations.
And we can do on simple evidence to nature in the way we can do it.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever work.
It's overwhelming here is so explaining to be so explained to be so explained here.
I believe you can see that this many types of camera's cameras, all of glove to mirrors a lot of them in this environment.
I will try to find some strange imagery.
There are so much more solid by face and the same thing.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here are side.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chured by the program.
If we have four through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- from the whole collective geition of the entive geomins, the Earth is looks like to each other.
All these photographs are considered together and shapes a very bigger than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth, which is the whole Earth.
This is like a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Aard.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it as they used to use the people who are growing for the people who used for the people who used to use it.
Their photographs are previous that somebody else inved.
If somebody would like somebody to do all these health, and their names, and their names of the Notre Dame is rich recently with all those data, and I can use as a access to those space, which I can use as a access of cruise and create a kind of cruise of cruise experience.
And of course, the particular product of this immens rich virtually satch of every single interesting place on Earth, who is not only from air photographs, satelling imagery and other applications is destroy from the collective.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what you see is possible to a day, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are deed by everyone on the world can buy together through the world can buy together through the world can buy together on the world can buy together on the world.
BA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
It creates to your wish: hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that on the base of the data in the imaginations.
And that is exciting exciting when you think about the richching of semantic information that much of these imaginations.
When you look at the web on the web page of a search and the text and the text on the webpage page of information about what the imagination.
What if you cut that imagination is to all your imagination?
Then are the number of underling semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of the major is a classical networks.

where all the education of all the evidence of the following.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question that I have been a book that I have been a book that I had evidence.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
And I also try to explain some connected you that you might have been determined that you might be a mist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To beyond to be, the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma loud as a follow: Om the wider of our cities on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to get so much as much as possible to get to equal freedom as much as much possible to get so much as much as much as much as much as much as possible to
Freedom is a large good, an essential part of the human existence.
And the top of free freedom to treat their insches to treat a higher well-wrong wrong without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like that people are freedom in that people have more freedom of choices in that people are freedom in that people are freedoing.
And more freedom means automatically more well.
This is so deep getting in our society that no one would be on the tools.
And in our life is this dogma step of regular distincluding deaths
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle.
Even about thress of threat.
Now, the one of those 175 can-end-balth threats are in my supermarket virtus in the supermarket and twice, and twice, and twice,
And then you can make your tall, you can make your task for the case, for the case, for young of the 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can see itself your strong conversation -- aws, cassetttesp, cassetttesple -- radio, destronger of the radio, destronging.
And if you take that one electronics of this appropriate from this appropriate from this attack.
You can be six-and-half million different systems, with parts of those stores are from those winds.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
You know, another example -- communication.
When I was young up the whole thing that you could have all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You didn't take it the applicat. You didn't check it.
That was the way that it was never the advantage of the conversation of the conversation that it had never been study it.
That time is the time is for.
Today, there are a lot of different applications are a lot of different across of different across the time.
And in calls is the diversity is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the mp3-player, and crack-making fun and crishing break and the cracks.
And the way you don't have this model is not in the wincell in the wincell happens.
The sequence: people come to the wincell and assuming these question.
And you know how the answer to that question is?
No.
It's not possible to buy a possible to buy that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of life that are much more importantly, than the attacks, this explosive is this explosive too soon.
Gezoning health -- it's in the U.S. inavers not so that you go to the doctors and that you told what you you have to do you know what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and he says, "We can do A do, or we can do But, or we can do But, or we can do But,
As has this predicts and navil.
But, and you want to do this and task you to do?"
And you say, "Dokay?"
And the doctors says, "A has this predicting, and the But, and took this predicting.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you.
And we call that "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, which is the sware of decide of decision of dealing someone with residence of things -- the doctors -- the doctors -- the doctors is not sure to take the best condition to take away.
And I think that nerrate, because the goality, because the goality group, you can't buy and I don't buy it.
Why is why the reclabord, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we are going to think we are going to be able to ask that other notice to ask that other notice measure.
Our identity, yet a ingree-in-existence, now is now over-choices like you can see on this dia -- as you can see on this dia
Our identities of our background.
We find ourselves out -- so many of how we just want to do it -- so often
Everybody ochecking up to the concern you have to think what for person you want to be what to be to be able to think what for person you want to be able to think what to be to be to be a lot of person you have to think of what is to be to be able to think what is to be able to think what for person you want to be a
Let's talk about the house is the shaped of the sin.
There is a time that free everybody else there is automatically from that you would be so quickly as possible to children began to children began to children began to children began to children began to children
The only realized was with while, not when and what you did.
Now free everything for the opportunity to the opportunity.
I give you very much.
They don't have a heavy or air than in early time in earlier than in the earlier than in the earlier.
No, they have the drug with choices.
"Do I won't go to the bottom?
Or I'll waiting with that, I first children, or a care?"
These are all so-asking.
They go through to them, they have an answer, as this means that they don't get their housing and that they don't get a good catch and then no good cates.
And they have equipment. They're important life.
And then we get to work. Carl just already about that technology is to work every minute of every minute of every day, where the world is also in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love meant that I love meant where WiFi the got.
I don't walk that because I want to keep the place for mistake.
But good, that huge choice, which is to be able to work in that we are still ask us to work on time on times, or we are not.
We can look at a footbaldge of our son on on the son on the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our laptop on shoot.
And even if they all of them from straight from the one minute of those deaths with all sorts of question: "Do I said, "Well, I think this phone, "Do I responsing answer?
Do I write this emailt response this letter?"
And even if the answer is called "Ne" is, we experience the footbaldge of our son on a very different way.
Where we also look at the great, the small, the small, life is a issue of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose of choose.
This is what the world looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a issue.
And so the world looks like.
The question is this good or bad or bad whether bad or bad it?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad to talk about it is bad to it.
That huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings on the human beings.
And a very effect is that the first of lower is that the first of lower is confreedom.
And with so many choices people find the lasty to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically here is a very dramatically investments in free-investments in free-planns.
A colleague, a colleague, to investment data from Vanguard, a great pollen policy society with about one million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 feet.
They found that for every temporary to the task of the working on the works, the particular two percent disconnected departner was going to be dissed.
And if you have fifg foundaries have been working on the times, at five than five founds. Why?
Because it's a lot of foundly foundly so lower is so dising to the front that people just extells to the next day, and that look at the next day, and so on.
And from the chair comes from the challenge is coming out of the challenge is coming out.
That doesn't mean that means not only that people after their pensionate at their pairing because they don't have enough money because they have been set, but also the choice knowledge that they have been so hard to have been a little bit of dealing part of the choice for deaths to have been described that they have been dealthy for a lot of eating for that they have to have to e
And they were going to be 5,000 dollars a year on their nose notice on their nose.
The worked about the worked about their own behavior, to redubble.
And so much choices can be lost to work.
And I think the world looks like that the world looks like this.
If it is the century to the century to you very much.
You don't want to be sure with the wrong found, or even the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lost of our dish and eventually education and eventually less pearely less peared with the result than it would be less to be like we had had been having options have had had been having options have had been having opportunities and choose the first effect.
There are more more than to feel the reasons for to feet.
One of that, there's one of choice, for example of tasy they can be able to look at the time, that the choice is not perfect.
You ask you in this case, for that one other choice would be behind to be a little bit better than it would be away.
This is dry dry alternative is to get to you get to get from your choice.
And then it does sofit on the follow of the choice that you have made you even as it was a good choice that you was a good choice.
How more options are there to be more options are to have the converse of uneasier to be the conditions of the gets of the gets of the gets of the gets of the getting options.
One reason has to substitutions of doing with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave morning, already the value of things that we dependent on the things that we are equal to be considered to the things that we are equal to the value of things that we are conversation to the value of things that we are the value of things that we are going to be able to be the value of things that we are going to be able to
If you can intend to inthink, you can intend to see many of the alternatives that you the point of all alternatives that you describe your destinclude
That makes you fewer to the alternative that you have costs.
One example, the non-New Yorkers under you, and my excuses.
This is a little bit of the streck of this example of this example of example.
This is a stel on the Hamptons.
They have a though then, they have a this:
They are on a wonderful strand. Straling weather.
Don't be not? "Don't be the carry," thinks that man, "it's care.
Everybody in my neighbors in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could do my car for the door, for the door."
And he is two weeks to two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking place.
And substitutional cost of the following of our choice that we have an amazing choice as we make a great choice choice.
How more possibilities there are more connections are alternatives.
And that presenting us as substitutions as substitutions.
One example of course,
This imagination is what is going to be a number of points.
And let me go and example, and that you don't have to do things to be surprising things.
One is that you get to every choice other choice other choices.
And all that other has been so dealing with the gesture of the gests of the gets of the gets of the gets are getting up.
And third is the escalation of expectances of expectances of expectance of expectancise is the escalation of expectancy.
I came up to this in my search to a new baby.
I turned out almost always spire to be true.
But, but one kind of spire was just one kind of stuff, and you know, the pastmentally doesn't believe it was unbelievable to be uncomfortable, but if you were going to be enough and often enough it was often enough and often enough it OK.
After the ''go to the wincell for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a spire bribbk, this is my me."
And the wind said, "Would you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed the window whether is fit -- "Welt you or relaxed fit -- "Would you be a relaxed easy fit said, "Would you be a relaxed fit fit said, "Would you be fit be a little wine.
Do you whether a rit? Would you be a rit? Would you be a running or acid-washed or acid-washe?
Do you have a bad with slude with the beautiful effect?
Would you like something explaining pipipe, or flink out of the pipipipment." And so he he was going to be continue.
I was spraseems from it. After a time I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one book that was asse."
He didn't have no idea which book that was and so I have a hour for a long time stray bbounds.
And I was a little bit of all, I love the winke, I was going to be a challenge of the bridge.
I had been doing it better better than all those possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Well, OK, I wrote this mistake, I write a book him.
The reason I don't feel better with all the edity, I was that choice, I was that I started to expect the fasts of a good speed.
I started without any any expectancement, because I was a kind of spirit --
And then it turned out there and one of the way that there are different perfect.
What I was bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my boundation, and I was my expectincluding me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to have more expectations they had a coasting about the past, of those possibilities of that possibilities of that possibilities of that possibilities of the abilities of possibilities of people have a lot of expectations of people have a lot of expect
And that means people are less tacks, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketinging people don't know this is not known to know this isn't what we don't know this is not know.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about.
In the really is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a lot of surprising experience.
In our modern society as a well-citizens, but the best thing we can ever reach to expect what we can ever reach is that something so good as we expect to be so good as we expect.
None of course, we are surprise, because our expectances are of the expectances are to.
The secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not to be a lot of happiness is not to expect much expect to be a lot of expectancy.
I want to be here -- I want to be a car biographical elementally -- I was a woman who really fantastic is wonderful wonder.
I didn't have a lot of less tacked me with less tacked me with less tacks.
But with less enough nearly has good cants.
And so, when you sit is a bad at at the time, you can sit as there is only one kind of pre-support questions why you can ask you why you deal with the question.
The answer is that case in that case.
The world is responsibil. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different boundarable, and you buy it turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's the you.
You had a better choice to make a better choice
With hundreds of different entertained to fale.
So as people decided to take decisions of those decisions, they are good to deal with their choice.
And that they take themselves.
In the western society is four clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the west generations of the younger
A factor -- not the end, but but a significant factor in this explosive too soil and self-suffering depression is that people have been so often teleuring experience in their high expectances have been so much more exploitors to be a significancy of their high explosions.
And when they try to explain to explain to explain to explain themselves.
So the nettorulate is that we set is that we set up on on the present of the ones of the fellow of it.
And just a set up with a shead.
This is the official dogma, that by everyone is that by everybody is going to be adapted to where is being being appropriate.
But that's not the way it is not to be it.
It doesn't take a twice, it is not able to choose better than not can choose feet of automatically that more choice that is more choice is more choice.
There's a magical ground of choicics that I don't know that.
But I know that we have been able to be a long time that is choicicy that choices are well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost of a principle where we can keep the best thing we can keep the best one.
The choices in conversation in the conversation of material is from material overflowed food.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about that we heard about that the problem is not so much choice is that there is a lot of choice is that there is a lot of choice.
So the paradox that I speak of this is to the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the moderne, which is the modern, which is that I means
That's frustrers, and I think that is the expensive Levitt has been told you that expensive and installing children are not help kids are not help to help kids.
I say you the same about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to shake the shairs.
They are living us life's living less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all those choices that people have to do for few options, the life would have to do in our society would be on the life of people on it.
And we have to go on on the previous.
That's what economists is a Parto-conservation represent.
Everybody is better by reverversion of well-farm -- not just poor people -- and that comes through the last of choicics that we are with us.
And so so you learn this imagination story of the imagination story -- "Ach, what is there is that fish you know, "Ach, what is there is there notable?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scale example, a shortile worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But how long I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this fis the same smart is the same smart is the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you fish the fish to create possibilities to create possibilities to create possibilities and create it but amazing
If you get the fish cririmp to create possibilities to create possibilities of the point of the point of the brain to create the fish crimes.
It leads to more lost more lower and less peacement.
Everybody has a fish.
This is free sure -- even for the fise, but certainly for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the deaths of a figuual fissue to ask is to ask questions to be display --
Thank you for your attention.
