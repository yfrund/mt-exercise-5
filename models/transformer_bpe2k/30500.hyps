Last year I showed these two dias, to show that the pool, which was the pool, who had the past three million years of the U.S. with 40 million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of crows.
But this particular problem is the nest of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disk of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice heap on the North Pole, in a way, the sheart of our global climate system.
It's in the winter and crimpt into the summer.
The next slide I shot is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is dumed in red.
As you see it out of darkly blue.
That's the year, that's the year,
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years or parent, which is almost like flowered blood, that from the body is so-up here.
In 25 years of this to this to this stuff --
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen clip around the North Icelerate and there are a very big amount of carbon on and finds that is forced by microbes in methane.
Some of the total amount of dishes in the atmosphere, that could double that could double that can double to the amount of the circumulate as we transmission.
In some undeep unfine mese, in Alaska sign of methane in the water.
Last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to improve
Whoo! She's OK. The question is the question or we will be that we will be that be going to be there.
A reason for that, is that this huge warm-heat bron" Greenland from the north of north warms.
This is a meltwo-atriver.
The water volume is the waterme greater than eye.
This is the Kanger-river-river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea so-style because it is the country.
These flug applies are going to take that.
On the other hand, the South Pole, the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
Last months reported scientists that all continent now that has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of South Pole, very quickly, very rapidly to the melting, with a few underwaters.
The whole continent state for six meters sea sourar foot for six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of largest ice ice mass of Himalaya, there are new now, who still glaciers were still glaciers there.
40 percent of the world's population gets half of his drinking water from that melers.
In the Andes, this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more flowing stroms.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read it, the predictions are nice.
This global dream of dreaming dream of forequal foot in a dramatical footage of forest fuels.
And the number of nature, of course, all over the world is speech, and never seen seone of the world --
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the last 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping about.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours --
25 mice tons of them every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille Ocean, from America, aa, axy, and each side, and each side, and each side, there is a drastic daling of the ocean in the oceans.
The only big ordinary judge of global warming, near deforestation, which is about 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extinctions, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coalas.
But we see a circle of the circle.
These are the coales carbon carbon became annuar in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed to the last years,
There's a political fighting in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industire last year 250 million dollars of them 250 million dollars from to promote "schone" --
And that image was doing something to me to something like that.
Around the churster was in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of liter coolmod.
You probably seen it in the news of the news of news
This is the one of the largest waste fall strics in America.
This happened around.
One of the advertiserations of the cooking cooking around,
Video: "Frosty the coal gue carbon is a still.
He's considered to this in America, and he takes us in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal gue is scree with the day.
He's paid and currently and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia fromber.
The largest mines worker of the country is the big batch of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship -- "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they talk about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on a tour on too.
This is a little bit from a lot of it.
Video "BuCOALergy, we see the climate change, as a serious threatening for our things.
That's the reason the reason the most important goal is to give a giant conversation to add a these, to the light and bring the light and the regular of truth of stead.
Fiit is, coal is not smarify to be notice.
We find that clean that it is -- and it still well.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Actor coal, you have heard a lot of carbon carbon carbon it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern short carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon cale.
Fantastic! The machines are make quite a little bit of a lay thing else.
But that's the sound of clean coal coal technology.
Despite the fact that the brought coal of coal warming the main orgine of the earth warming warming is the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at the good around, this is the clean technology today is the day.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative with our economic challenges and that was national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong of crisis, the economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire wire is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel like dirty collected oil.
But now there's a felt new solution to get out to get out of this.
And front of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to work to get a security that makes us security and the global warming of the earth to.
Finally, a solution that size is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Design.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: So it's about to give America.
One of the fastest ways to make a end of our dependence of old fuel of old fuel that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Oh, 22: Oh, New investments to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speakword that says, "If you want to be all right.
If you want to go far far far far together."
We have to go far far far away and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am for those who didn't have any of the ones that didn't have the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever underneath nearly entered -- 27 miles in bribe.
It must be the circumstances that were at less than a billions of second after the universe of second after the universe was beginning to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, s!
This is the machine under Geneva.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectanoent picture of ATLAS in connections so you can see the scale.
And at 10 last years, we put the machine for the first time we put the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a party in the control room in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that all around the way around the LHC, and with crashet with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was catching in the detector ctortures were flowing in the detect of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw that picture was at 10 September we knew that the machine working that was a huge over.
I don't know if this was the largest across and this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of the Internet page out of saw that the Internet page.
That means that we have made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientistic impact as a scientistic impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we have a cultural impact a cultural impact as a
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was doing with these golden drames.
And those behaviors ago, 13 thousand amper when the machine works.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they are superago, because they are superago.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can be shaped the beings that flow stream ago.
In one of the nine of the nine thousand magnine in the LHC, was a constructive from.
And it was a wire wire of it was intended to be electric resistance against that 13 thousand amplifice.
This was the result.
This is more impression, if you realize that that magns are going to be more than 20 tons more than 20 tons -- and they were put about 30 inches in the way.
We hard to do about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of it, what we did it.
We all saved them when we all saved them.
Now they're back to the way.
Eind murched the LHC again.
We will put it back back and we expect measures in juni or right so we can go further to figure out what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, these unfortune have started to reincidents the value of scientific research.
I think it's fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go beyond than the LHC.
I let the last words of the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I was did, I was doing the defined of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the Farase, "None's dangerous for the progress, and they were not going to take the human mind that there are not to take our images of science that there are no new world's really, that there are no new world." And that there are no new world."
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to ask you to ask your children at your children play.
When you discovered how to grab it up, and they went up and wood, and conscious, you were actually learning to solve them with with the engineering and hands of space.
Rumtelevision is strong consider the world to understand the world to us.
If a information that if an information that we can inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my fish, Jeedor Jeed-ask Jeed. What if we were a computer that would ask to ask -- what if we would have a computer that moves on a free that moves on a finger that moves on a plat the finger that moves on a plat the bital finger information that we can described with their both information with the neighborhoods can be able to asking information with the neight of information with with with with with the neighborhoods of information that moves on a fount that moving information with the neat the neat the neat the neighborhoods that moves that are ineded
and ordering ordering as we want?
This question him was so concerned that we decided to look for a single of looking for a building Sifttables.
Sort cooky is a Siftable computer size a computer size size of a cooky.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together their movement detect and they contain a screen and they put a screen and wireless contact with the squattery and they conact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traility, just like blocks can be moved by put into it.
And the things that are Sifttables an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information.
And that these helping tools have a more physical ships, behavior, are conscious of their movement, and even of the way we move them all the new way and also interact new and neat interactions of discovering them in the way we move them, there are different new and even of the way we move them to discovery.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video that is playing by the size of call, and others and others:
These interactive portraits are consciously.
Indians as to each each each each other of each each other of interesting together.
If they get surround, they can also be able to do this and what nervous become a little become a little nervous thing.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting results of these interaction, the use of all the time, the use of all, as it expanding a fluid of color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of the interesting of color,
In this example of three Sifttables emmers to be using them to go color in a spirit for good, where they become color in a very empty of gone.
If we have threat the threatens, we went back a little bit back.
There are some couple of crash education, predict players with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the opportunity to prove things to see to immediately raping to see it very quickly immediately fly in the middle of the education and the result of people to prove things to pro
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci through a simple comput;
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get around a randomed letter on every Siftle, and then form words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it's very rescued and applies a new series of letters with contributed possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I sleep in the Media Lab, and I sleep them out and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions to have instructions of these applications needed instructions.
All you all that you have to say, "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to testing it.
That's our youngest ber breeding tester, right?
And it turns out he was just saying the Sifttables well,
For him these were just blocks.
Here is a painting-painted painting.
We wanted to learn a platform for language of language
This is Felix that demonstration.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Sifttable with that character of the table.
Here he leaves the sun rise.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene of the scene of the scene
Video: The orange tractor.
God thoughan! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the name to each other places and the narest side, he can responding the characters with each one -- Video: World Wa!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end up with an open end.
and he decided to destroy;
Video: The cat flour.
DM: The last example I will show today Is a synthesizer and live music child that we developed in the lead, where every Sifttables a sound produces like the lead, bass and press precished.
Eengineer, four different variations, where you can choose what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the way Sifttables so you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the tanks of a livable effects are alive available effects like reverb and filter.
They are being flowed to a sound and adapted by the side.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are admitted on the whole pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern of the entire pattern to the whole pattern of the pattern effects like tempo and volume that are being admitted on the whole pattern effects like temo
Let's look at that.
Video: Did we start with a liad in two Sifttles, to a first pattern by an extra first pattern by an extra lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: Do I add some some beat.
Video: DM: And now I coping the filter on the drums, so I can affect the effect live in the effect lique.
Video: Do I can accelerate it by the size of the tempo blocks.
Video: Do I cope the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: Do I can reach the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything else and make it very longer and shorter like I want.
With the dimessage the dimp Siftable to the left Siftable to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion and my passion is going to make new people in the way our brain in that way our brain and both interfaces that our brain and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the atsize to a whole new generation to a whole new generation for the interact with digital media, that bring the information of our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it out to you all of you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also writing so much more than that.
My whole life for a long time I had to write and I don't think that that ever change.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and career in my life, and career that I had to go to my work with my work on my work on my work on --
And it began with a book that I wrote unfre: "Est, Biddle moire: "Et, B, that very very contradiction to my earlier work all the world and a international exist.
And the consequenced that people now have to pull me as if I am am doing all over the way around and always task me for the consequence.
So what -- I mean -- gets me!
People come to me and ask me and ask to ask you don't afraid you never afraid you never afraid you will never eat this succes?
Do you don't afraid you will keep writing your whole life will never be a book that people are going to write where people will walk warm.
Do you don't have that frigh?"
Frg assumption, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- but I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, I was a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get success, you don't get succes?
Do you don't know that afraid you will go to the such of it that you will have to do it by you?
Do you don't know that your life on this work without a work without that there ever ever ever felt to be able to be in your broken up with your bitter bitterea bitter a's axis of bitter axing your mouth of fail?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short comes to that questions on that questions on this is "Ja."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all of these things that are called affect.
All the time.
But I am also a lot of other things that afraid and you don't know what it does.
For example, for example, and other things like that.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that comes from, the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be working for their work for working for their opinion to their opinion to their opinion to their opinion to be fright?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the memorial of the mind of the mind of the mind of others don't happen to the other species are all not going to happen.
Take my father. He was separated engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he worked somebody ever asked somebody ever asked somebody ever asked him for him or he was not afraid for that.
So "Yohn, how is it with your chemistryblock?"
No, it wasn't talking about it.
To fair too behit: Phind engineers have been not crashes to be not the reputation of manic-depressive alcoholists.
Scheating, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, other creative people have turned out to be pretty instable to be pretty instable.
And look at the grimming death the most magnife creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died you, often you, often by own own stires of own own stires.
And even the ones that no suicide places, they seem to be under their gave too be concerned to be under their gave too be high-ord place.
In the last interview for his death said, "With each of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mitself."
That's a little bit about your lifese.
But of these kind of spoke of this kind of excited.
We all have heard it before, and have heard it with my all accepted.
The heavy is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked to suffering with suffering and that a powerful eventually insuffering to missing to missing the telling.
And so that is I want to ask everybody here today is that idea life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I think I'm going to think about it, I think it's not a very fast for a lot of thought.
I think it was resistance.
And even dangerous.
I wouldn't see that this century as well.
We can spore creative several better to life.
I sure that it would be in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark to that dark in the dark of the dark --
Seally, the fase where my career is in my career turn.
Go just took you, I'm still young, a high-young,
I can spent four decades in front of decades.
Hoperating all the time that I now published to be seen by the outside world as the work that followed on that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends below each other, so I can be able to explain you: highest my greatest success already behind me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this, you know, it's about the morning to you, it's the morning to the desire to the derank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love working on the work I like to hold me that I love the work that I love the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love to the work that I love love to the work that
The question is, "Hoo?"
After long as a long time I think I can go to the conclusion that I can just go through writing a psychological protection in the process.
I must see the writing a security distance of creating myself and my convert to the very very very understanding to the responses in my future publications.
I was looking for the last year, I was looking for ways to do that.
I am in history and I do in the history and repull in other civilizations to see or others have found better way to see or others to have found creative people to go with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search a quest me in the old Greeks and Rombites and Rombs and Romb.
And then let up, because it's a long story.
In the time of old Greeks and Rombites and Rombs people didn't believe that creativity was from hero.
And they believed that creativity was a godle-such spirit -- unknown space to the human beings came to human beings acknowledge and unknowledge of a dispot reasons.
The Greeks called this calling seats of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed he had a demon who was influistered him words to refluistered him words
The Romends had a species of the same idea.
And in them called a guy creative creative spirit was a geni."
The funny is that the Romain with a genius with a genius to have a genius to have a genius to be involved in a genius with a genius with a genius with a genius with a genius to have a pient.
In their policy was a genius a kind of magical god-magical god-in the walls of the ateller of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house --
And if the artistic was working the genius assistance.
And he gave to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I talked about the psychological protection against the results of work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work work.
The artistic was taken by protection to a lot narcism.
If you were brilliant, you didn't get all the home.
Everyone knew new that was invisible genius you have helped in your mind
Well your work was crazy, that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genia.
Lange time that was how in the West, creativity was considered to the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was changed in the Renaissance,
There was a whole new idea: the individual ment, the individual ments is the middle of the universe and allow all gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, by mystical creatures,
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual for.
And for the first time in history was there about artists said that they were not talking about artists and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and the first time in history was in history in the first time in history.
I have to say that I find a big fromed wrong.
And to make one person, one single individual that he or she is to make it fat, the essentially mysteriod of everything that was didlaborate and the cour, creative and the most known forced -- that's too much to a fragic human bepsyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun into swallowed to swallow the sun in the sun.
Egos are re-blown proportions, and there are increased to proportions to prestations to prestations to prestations to prestations --
And I think this present has made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists purpose.
If that is, and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we back to a parent understanding parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relation?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years of wealth, we can make 500 years of humanism in a 18 minutes far speech.
Probably in the audience people who have reed the scientific people who have been reduced the idea that elphysical creatures of some of facts with some of facts to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring high-like these.
I don't like me that I will get you in there,
And yet, I'm going to ask it.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought don't possible?
It just felt as much as well, as much as all other explanations of totally calcultive unknown in the creative process.
Everyone who have to create something that has to create all the assion, all the assume here -- that it doesn't always rational process rational process is not always rational process rationally
And that sometimes it feeling almost paranormal.
I have the great American closer American closer to the American closer to the U.S.
She's thick in the nine. Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood, you know, she was a little bit about Virginia.
Some of the work, they were felt at the work on the work of the work.
And it was so said, "Well, as if there was a big wave air.
So my poember, they poem about the country to her --
She felt that the ground, and she knew her feet and he knew her on that moment her at that point, and I knew her life.
She ran home, back home and she had to do the poem and she had to see paper and sheet and paper to paper and paper to paper and paper to paper and paper to paper and sit up to paper and paper to paper and paper than so fast as possible.
When it poem by her hunt her hunt waves her only opportunity to write it on it.
Sometimes she wasn't fast enough.
Then they ran and ringing them, but calcular it wouldn't do it.
As these kinds of solid by her him, disappearing -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And there were some of the story -- I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they were the poem -- they almost to miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper it by paper and she's foot the poem by her hiching her and she's going to look for paper and paper it by her hion.
Junew that potle-had them than a potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she was told me it out of the air.
She pulled it close to his tail it back into her body, and it back into her body, while she wrote it.
And in that cases came up to the poem of what is very much in the paper of paper, but then in the end.
When I heard that -- I thought that -- what accident, my creative process.
That's what my creative process. I don't do a medium!
I am a mouth, which every day is a mouth, and the same time on the same time and trans and transand crashes and trans it gets through it.
But even in that daily swrately shaped that experience.
You will also know it ourselves that feel you can know that there are creative ideas in your record from a source that you can identify impossible to identify impossible.
What is that that for brone?
How can we use it without a lot of the one?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interview him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life has been a big part of his life has been shown in the contemporary artists that tries that is trying to get out of all power to the unconcerned on the unconnective impulses that taken into him.
With the 's, Tom a little bit more quote --
One day he resisted in Los Angeles over the fighway, and changed the process of radical.
Whereas he already there he heard a clip of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that does caterable, ingraph -- wellent.
It was a beautiful melodied and he wanted to fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no a taneously at the time.
The well-known excited, and then the melodies of head, and then it stays and then it stays to me eterribs.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get a little bit of panick, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new thing.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear and said, "Sorry I sat up the sense of the stuff --
"Do you really think I can write a song?
If you really want this songly comfortable you have to add when I have time for you.
Don't not -- anybody else fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And then when it was losing the process of the process of very different.
The work itself is the same thing, with the existing of the dark toon.
But the heavy that the creative process in him report the creative process in the genius.
The genius was going to poem on the skin and saving just a single one.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go up with it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the property, a kind of conversation between Tom and the property.
And that story has changed my way of working.
I had profit from it.
I was sitting in the middle of Ets, Biddle --
I left focused in despad.
You know that you know, you don't want to do it and you don't think it's a terrible disaster disaster is to be a terrible book ook ook in it.
Not just just bad, very horrible bad bad bad bad bad bad there.
I wanted to do all the project.
And then I remember Tom that was remembered to his genius who were going to be way.
I wonder from my manuscrips and focused crip, and I focused to a very further of the room.
And I said hardoperating hardoperating all that if this book is not just like this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have in what I have in my having in what I have in it.
More I can't give it.
If you find that it can be better than you have to get your thing to do is to get your thing to do is to get your thing.
Do you don't mean that one, youammer thank you.
I just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notabulous ones that are just dished that is just a lot of appear."
Tja--- -- Usources it up here ...
Euwen ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in months to dance in month, to dance in month,
Ones and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, something, there is something extraordinary extraordinary --
One of those dancers was than transcendent.
You know, you know that I mean, you've ever seen a little bit of a slightly in a performer.
It was like the time was time and the dance of time and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now I now felt everything else together.
And suddenly he didn't have a human beings just a human beings.
In him, under him blowed him glood.
A goddant fire.
And if something called the things happened, knew people what it was Dan she was began to clah, they clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was it for them.
By the way, a fun historic fact, when the Mors South South Spanu Spanin Spanin, they brought these habiting with it.
The spoke is echer by the centuries and dog changed of "Allah" in "One, Allah."
And that you hear the day today and the flaments and flaments and flaments and flamental governments and flah.
If an artists in Spain something impossible or magically, is a messays, "Allah, oil -- "Allah, oh, great, oh, great, Allah, great, well, well, it's all the time.
Sequivalent of God.
Precient what we need.
Lasty is the dance is the dance of the dance of the front of the wake of the morning of 11 in the morning of a didle-hour-in the morning lads.
At that moment he is a little parents of couldn't get couldn't get to be able to come to these while will never come to such up to these kinds of parent.
Maybe there will never be somebody God will never attackle in his dance.
What does he have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to selling to sells a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be too highly honest.
Imagine that you don't have that the most unusual aspects of your person are coming out of you.
Imagine that you believe them a while, you have a while,
When you are ready with it, they are giving somebody else.
So that's how to consistent.
I high invenues that thought to be thought to do it.
The last months I've worked on a book that will be short to be short a lot of solid to go to a lot of reflecting to is excited.
The operating that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the hall, I like to go and go the same thing to be -- I'm not afraid.
Do just you work.
For just you do thing -- you know, what it is.
If you are task you to dance you, thank you.
If the god-head, you have admit to decide in your work at some point at some points to make a little bit of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the well-well-well-a-w."
Adoperating that not, dance but continue.
And then, "Oh, well, "Oh, well,
I believe that of heart.
"Oh, whatever, whatever, because we have human love and propertly, human love and propertly,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: One!
You know, I had talked about some of these projects, some of these projects, about human genome, and what that can mean and what that can mean and what it can mean to discover of genes.
We actually start from a new point: we were the biology to the digital create, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology and the design and synthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand the different levels of levels.
We tried different approaches, it bring to minimum and bring the minimum components.
We're almost 20 years of digitize it now 20 years of digitizing today.
When we have the human genome genome we sequenced the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the organization world of the computer.
Now we try to ask and ask alive, or can we create life and create new life -- we create new life -- we create new life --
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory that can considered themselves in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can come up to a nature genome.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolic map, that relatively relatively compared to the one.
Gelve me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at a lot of the genes that would probably be able to be able to be able to be able to do a living cell cell cell of the genes that could be able to do a living cell cell of the genes that would be able to look at all the genes that would probably be able to do a living cell cell
And we decided that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we are asking questions like this, "Can we have a chromosome of synthesessopm synthesess?"
Stage the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, we can a chromosome "up?
A chromosome is a chemical chemical inds of chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of digitize the digitize of life is accelerating exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code -- but it's admitted to write the crazy slowly across the case of the crazy of the point of opportunities.
And our final point it would put on this point on a exponential curve.
We're starting to have more than 15 years ago.
There were some staged to start a couple of stages, with a bio-ethical keeping the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very difficult --
There are tiends of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length of DNA degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of them are going to be able to make it piece of it.
So we had to make a new method for the building these little pieces and correct the correct of all the falts.
And this was our first poging, beginning with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria deate.
We designed the chicks, we did the fell correction,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning of when we put a chemical chemical chemical chemical code in the bacteria circuits, and virale particles were going to make the genetic particles were going to make a little bit of the circles were going to make a little bit of the bacteria little bit of the bacteria little bit of the bacterter
The virale particles were going to be losed when they came back and they were back and killed the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they were to do that model but all to be able to well.
They laugh more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of the chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterterial chromosome of the entire bacterteri
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could various --
to understand what the comfort components of a living cell cell.
The design is critical and if you start start with digital information in the computer than to the digital information that are very accurafly accurae.
When we first did this genome for the first time was the standard of 1995 was the standard precision one frozen a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 from, we had the original sequence of sequence sequence than the original sequence.
Most of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters to all other pieces of all other pieces of the things that we have to build smaller sub-unities that we have to design together.
We design unique parts in here.
Maybe you have read watermarks that we put watermarks in it.
Bedition is, we have a four-genetic code: A, C, G, C, Great and T.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there is a single sous.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, single words, single thought.
Avanced we just "mout, "Oh, it's just a little bit of sign.
Some of them were felt that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with anzyms.
There are enzymes they repay and put together together and together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces that five to 7,000 letters who were five to 7,000 letters long, just taking 24,000 letters to each other, and you have 24,000 letters of the things that are to 72,000.
In each stadium, we got a flowing of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could sequences a process that very robuust -- that will be very robusted -- that will you see straight you'll see the straight one.
We try to achieve the point of automatisation to achieve the point of automatisface.
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
Once we come to the real big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares, they don't grow as easy more in E. coli.
That expanding the most modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-o-o-co-combination called homolo-like biology to repair DNA --
Here is a example of it.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiation to can.
And that you see in the top panelel, set up the top panel, sopm just som out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it again, and he put it again,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dried up in the way.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can promote that can be moving to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is many of the way, there is many of the way.
Here is a micro-phone-molecule that we made with these processes -- that we made with these processes -- in fact, just yesterios with the right design of the pieces that we did in them.
And it took that they add automatically add automatically
This is not electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes on a six seconds.
This is the publication that we spent unfellow across the publication that we were going to spend one.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then 142 pages just to pressure.
Now, how do we started, how do we go up a chromosome of the activations it?
And there is a virus it's clearly very easy.
And a bacteria bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you the eukaryots, like us, you just what, you just what, you just know the cell and do some other in, and that's what you know as it clons.
And if you the bacteria species of chromosome of cell, but we have to show that we have to see a full transplant that we can actually show a full transplant of a chromosome from a cell to a other, and it can be able to a different and activate it.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbbs.
These are about as far from each other as people and muizing.
We added some extra genes so that we could select for this chromosome select for this chromosome of the foot
We have it to make it with anzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graph -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to the solid to soil, but we tried to develop the process further out of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of these kinds of kinds of kinds of third chromosome of third thousands of thousands of properties in one times.
People who are evolution to evolve as if there are not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are called restrictions that are actually called DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the cell we put it in it --
It was expression, and it was recognized the other chromosome as strange as strange of material, and so we finally had the cell with the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the freezed material, and so that we finally had the celling material,
He was blue because he was put the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the characteristics of one species, and changed completely new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein changes, the membranes changed -- when we were changed the genetic code -- changed.
This is a magine alchemistry, but we're in state, but we're in stating, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
All right, I've been paying that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is front boards on 3.5 billion years evolution, and I pay maybe almost a new version of Cambric explosion of Cambrical explosion where there are big new species of new species of crossed new species of the new species of crather new species of crash new species of cross --
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly as you look at what it need.
We're going to go inso-and-half billion people, and a half to nine billion people, the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context -- I was born 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
for each one of us who lived in 1946; within 46, that will be four years that there are four years.
We have trouble with food, with the clean water, medicine, medicine, drugs, fuel for the six-and-half billion.
And that is hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collectures, more than 30 billion ves;
That's 100 miloons of fat.
When we take biological processes in ogency or what process process than to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, all these carbon dioxide of the stice that comes in the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We are precedented by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques of synthesesemethods to do so-called combination genomics."
We've now got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the processes of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimes, or tries to optimes, or drugs, or drugs, new vaccines, new vaccines, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for life-fatbirth, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen map-flection of what real designer software where we going to go to the high and a new kind of on the computer can design a new kind of on the computer in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what we do to work on the computer of the computer of what we can actually go to the bound.
We don't know how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus now fourth generation of fuels.
Our longs have seen to ethanol experiment, just a bad experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come out from sugar, like sugar, to more highly fuels like octon or different kinds of buttanol species of butanol species of butanol of buttanoli.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price higher and the available and the available to relay as we start with CO2 as we are starting with CO2 as his food, and so we are cells to design that way, and we think we are the first fourth generation that we do the first fourth generation of fuels, and we have the first four months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but by our global discoveries of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, in cookable to cook cook cook of temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy hydrogen as energy sources as energy sources.
We are looking at whether we can take CO2 and we can take a pipell through pipes to factories where that CO2 to fabriess, where that CO2 to sburns to sandster this process.
So in a short while we think we are able to think we are able to bread on the basal question: "What is alive to the basic question: "What is alive is like?"
We actually have real, you know, we have the protected petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where you can do this, where you wouldn't do this,
A major energy source of energy source.
But we also work on this tools to think about these tools to think about faster servaccines.
This year there was the flu, we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by teaching vaccines of teaching vaccines.
So here you see how the future can see because the evolution tree is going to change the evolution tree, the evolution of synthetic bacteria, and ultimately eventually eukaryota.
We are still removed from people.
Our goal is to assume that we make a chance to survive for a long time to survive to do that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought in a connection to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a single that you get locally or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data visual data that we can work.
We look at many gigabytes here to digital images and can stay in the way, and then they can keep in and expand expand the sorts and the sorts and the sorts to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel
It all of it makes nothing that is that the only thing that was the performance of the way to affect system, on a short system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graug house by Dickens. Each column.
To prove that it is really text, and not imagination, and not imagination, we can do something like this, to show that this really text; this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a very strange of a way to read a way to read a third book in a front of the way to read a strange of read.
I wouldn't admit to me.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a submersible.
This gives you really the pleasure of a real paper of a real paper magazine or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium.
We also have done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a np advertising advertising -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the limitations of hands through the screen by doing the screen by doing the screen of hands,
We hope that this doesn't mean that means and other things that will be more flaul -- not needed to be more flaul -- not needed to be more flaul -- not needed to be more than it to be more pop-ups and other things that will be flaul to be more pop-ups ups and other flaul -- not needed up to be more pop-ups and other things that will be more pop-ups and other other people.
Of course, a lot of the maps are a way to have a technology like this, to a technology like this, I will not spend here to spend here -- I don't spend up here to this field that we can also contribute a lot of contribute to this field --
These are all the roads in the U.S.
For on top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now live in the Web; you can look at it.
This project called Photosynth, who are two techniques together two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoter to the University of Washington,
and Rick Sself-Microsoft Research. A beautiful convertion.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible.
When we do this, we see this -- we can experiences the images and the multi-resolution.
The Some disilliant squared here is meant here is meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together so they were bring the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized images, and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is time, other environments.
There are a lot of more more space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in this summer -- to the communicate that I have in my head is the reality of these technique force of the environments on our website.
We had to do account with the lawyer and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs gives a image image that was part of this model turned out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this orange that were part of this orange that was sharing a picture again.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are shopping these way are spots of these things are spot.
And we can do a simple way way to fignore in a simple way to follow way.
You know, I never thought that I would have ever worked at Microsoft would work at Microsoft.
It's overwhelming to be getting up here to be getting up here to be getting up here to be so unforth.
I believe you can see that these many types of cameras are cameras, all of the guns of them, to a big number of it, a big number of it, conversation.
I'll try to find some strange some strange images
There are so many works and so many of faces and things like that.
And somewhere between this is actually actually a series of photographs -- here they are one.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is churated by the program.
If we have the poster in diving in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now that everybody -- of everybody -- of the entire collective memory of how to see it -- and the Earth looks like this, and the copy -- and it's all the way to each other.
All these pictures are constructed, and forming together a lot of bigger than the som of the parts.
You've got a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth --
As a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Aard.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it as wells the provide of the people who use it.
Their own photos are being provision of metapa that somebody else in the world.
If somebody would like somebody all these health, and their names and their names and their names are require to the Notre Dame is require to all of these data, and I can use a access to that space, which is using metape versu, usually use any photographs, and created with this kind of crosse, and created social experience.
And of course, it's be-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not just out of air, who is not just out of air, but also in the collective images and other applies is to be searching from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you software possible to a day, in the next years, all of the images that are going to be died by everybody on the world can copy in the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this really is discovering.
It creates, create your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the data in the images of data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is semantic information that are accounts.
When you look for images to pictures and you go to pictures, and you have a search in the webirth, and the text on the weber on the image of information about what the image represent.
What if now is that copied imaged to all your images?
Then are the number semantic connections and the amount wealth riched that comes from that comes from that prefer from that previous comfortable networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure of traveling and of enographically research is the possibility to live between them that have not forget to live in the wind, who are not forget in the wind, the point in the wind, the professions.

And the right thing that is the most optimistic scenario scenario for cultural scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is losing to language.
When everybody here was born born there, there were six-thousand languages on Earth in the earth government.
A language is more than her word-scat or her grammatical rules.
A language is a flookers of the human sice.
It's the vehicle that by the sicl of every unique culture, the material world.
Every language is a century ancient mind, a separation, a separation, an ecosystem to spiritual opportunity.
Of that six-thousand of talks today is not the day of not more in children's fluistered in children's fluistered in children's ors.
They are not longer to be too longer instone.
Effective means that unless a change, unless a change, that they are dead.
Is there something like this, by being held by helping the last of your people, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to speak the promise of the ancestors of the kids must be?
And the recient tergenous state every two weeks of them somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks of them are dying in the last lettergreats of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, the world are not better place, if we all the same language if we all the same language would speak to take Yoruba taks. Or Kantones. Or Kantones. Or Kantones. Or Kantones.
Or Kogi.' You will realize how it could be not talk to to you how it could be spreading.
So what I actually want to do today is a little bit of a short journey by the etnos-foot image must be lost of what in fact,
Many of us that when I have to talk about "a different way of being in a different way of minds; I really really really different ways.
For example, this Barasa child in the North Amazone, the people of the anaconda, that she believe that she believe that she is in foot the foot of the eyes of the eye of the eye of the eyes of the eye of heavy snake.
This is a follow that cognitive the colors of blue and green not underestimate the craft of the odds of the odd equal of the own, where the people dependent on the odd of it.
They have a singuistic language-marriage-marriage-se-well-marriage.

One of the fascinating steamms that I had been lived with which I lived in Norani in Norani in Norani in Northern Ecuador, a separate connect in 1958 set in 1958 set was red.
In 1957 tried five missionars, but they were touching to explain a critical fale.

They got the photographs and tried the shape behind the face behind the face of the face of the face behind the face.

One continent to be exteming outside of the animate that Africa had been belief that Africa had no religious belief had this belief -- they had this to.
Voodoo is simply the destate of this deep religious ideas, religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during the slavery,
What vodoo do is that interesting is the living life is the living between living and the dead of living and the deaths of living and the deaths of life,
The living bars the spirit --
The spirit can be touched from under the Great Water, the dancing of the spirit of life in the spirit of life in the spirit of a single time that during the follower is the follost of the god.
That's why they say foot death, "You excited, you know, you go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple and God." And because you put it through the spirit by the spirit by the spirit -- what can you happen to do that?
This leads to a amazing tone-follows in trance that leads to trance that bluffele light sing:
This is demonstrates the opportunity of the spirit to influence when this extrme when this is extreme when this extracked in the body.
Of all the people that I've ever lived with with the Kogi the most extraordinary -- a follow out of Colombia.
And then After chamelations of the Tairona civilization, which ever the Cariban coast of Colombia have populated populations in the nasleep of the disset.
They were tried to be back in a geisolated volcanic mass that above the coast flake.
In a blood continent to a blood continent was just this follow by the Spanile.
As that they get through ritual priesthing, but the training to priest is quite extraining to priest is quite extraordinary extraordinary pries;
The young acolites are being holds in their families as they are three or four or four there are three or four or four there.
They are separated in a world of duisternis, in stones of the nernis, in stones of foot in 18 years.
Two periods of nine years, conscious to message the nine months of nine months that they into the shape their mother.
Now, they are in the scoot of speaks in the launches of the big mother.
These whole time, them are being brought them the society that are reaching the attacked that only help the cosmic or ecological, or ecologicical.
This inducation finds that finds up with the day they were going to be in their life, and they are 18 in their life, if they were 18 in their life, and they have a sunshesophisticated in the shelling of the true light, as the Son the share all of the beautiful count in the fact everything they have learned in follown in fully following hits everything that they have learned in follown in the follow of the first botttest in their life,

That's how beautiful it is to protect this too protect to protect this parents of brothers.
According them are the younger brothers, who are responsible to the world.
And at this pointuitive-a-stock age.
If we think of inhead, we often thinking about and landscape, and often the old fabulous factoral of the edelay wild, a idea that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we share half-Thoreau and say that these people closer to the Earth state than us.
Inheay folks are nor expect by nostalgy.
For both of the Earth is very little space in the malaria moer squito: the idea of Tibed With or in the ice-winds of Tibet. She and ritual mystic mystic mystic of the Earth, which is not consciously, but in the idea of the Earth of the Earth is based in in a much subtiely, the idea that the Earth is the idea that the Earth is just the idea that the Earth is the idea that the conditivice, the confouncashistories can only one.
What does mean? It means that a little child from the Andes, which is grown up with believe that the mountain in a mountain in that lead, a fundamentally different relations, and a other relationship of other relations, and a other relationship to the foundly in from Montana, and a little child in Montana, mountain in in the idea that the mountain in of Montanay to mine.
Or it the living of a spirit is irrelevant.
Interestingly is the metaphor that defines the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were crasses there were ckeeping into it.
And that made me another people, I believe my friends of the Kwagiul-these, who believe that those forests are living the Cuxwhukw and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the opportunity of the world in the north of the world rounded around the world frombers in the world front of the world friends that were in the north of the world --
These spirit are important during their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
If you start to understand the idea that these cultures different reality that these cultures different realities of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant. Take this plant. Take this plant. Take this plant.
It's a picture I april that I april in the North Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoics from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating is that fascinating is not just the farmacological potential to it, but how fit is. It's built from two sources of sources.
And silliance there is a wood-carbon that took carbon and harmaline in itself and heart hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating carbon and slight hallucks.
If you just take the plant flowing that a blue smokle by your blue flowing your consciousness of consciousness by your consciousness of blue by your consciousness by the consciousness of the blue of the blue of the blue is just like the blue of the blue of blue by the blue of blue by the blue of blue by the blue of the blue of blue fissides
The plant is malthough with a coffee beat like this, Psychotria fridis.
The plant slightly wears powerful try-ptamines, nauthority to brain serotonine, dimethyltry-methoxyltry-ptamine.
Do you ever see the Yanomami as they have snuion, who are substances that substance of different kinds of methoxyltry?
That pooder your bless, you know, it's like a pulled again, and they have been taken up with barokay, to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not a reform of realit; it does not reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultanes -- a man who did the psychedelic aded, who did invent the psychedelivery in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I pay the tryer that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating because when the effect are intract -- because of the hallucination to experiences. Tryptamines are not oral oral in the human dark in the human darm: monitor set in the human darm: money: micice: monoxidase.
They can only be taken engaged with something that the monoamine of sun-effect.
The fascinating is that the beta-carbon in the light of the sample of the guns of the sample to activate the tryptamine of tryptamine in a flora of 80,000 planet of following species of 80,000 plants of two morphological various species that are combined species that are very forced species that are very forced in the bigger than the shape of the parts of the parts of the spire that are sprat.
We say eufemistic "trial and ror," which is as a meaningle-to-mas;
The Indians say, "The Indians talk, "The plants talk against uns.' What does does that? This stem the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuge distance that they can identify all of the way to our eyes as one kind of would be a kind of money.
If you ask their questions of how they bring their taxonomy in the task of plants.
You know, I said, "No." I said, "No." I said no."
And it turns out to all the 17 species of the follow moon in different toird of spots in different toird of spots.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book, boot than measure than measures.
Now, the problem is that even the ones that sympathic operating under us that sympathic completely foot them as curious and color, and color, in the history while the real world, meant in history,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remembered to be remembered to his war, or his technological innovations, but earlier as the era in which we were in it, and active participes or passive advanced to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures always have shared to a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem is not the problem.
The Siouxindians don't stop Sioux -- when they were operating their pile, and they were going to be able to be Americans and they were stop Americans to be Americans when they were to be their purpose and way.
It's not changing or technology that drives the integrity of the foot one. It's power.
The wread face of the government.
And what you also see in the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living follows are existing by identified by identified to their appropriate opportunities.
Or this is about the huge unfortuned in the home of the Penan, a nomadic Southeast Asiatically follow that to the forceating in the forces that to the forceducated to the reverse and prostitution to the river service to the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the river of Borth -- that it seemed to the Sout, where you can see the sunt from the South truth --
to fillull their set with tree tribes of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that are inside of the discovery as a result of discovery of discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excitement of a people, universal regulation of a people, but none-four life's destroyed in many places even become a lot of the part, but in many areas as even four development.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level of Tibet is going to get to the basic level of Tibet is not to instant in touching of Tibet is not to contain the practice.
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles of the country of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And it was when I came to Lhasa in Lhasa face behind the statistics where you hear about.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people killed the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And he was focused on the Chinese invasion when the Chinese invasy.
His flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people into Nepal --
His mother was prisoners;
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was two -- he was two -- because they didn't couldn't cover her ro, because they don't couldn't cover him.
The sister that heldhaftip smokle was put in a couple of the crasmoket into a couple of the crasmokle of the smoket of the smokle smokle of the smokle smokle of the sister smoket that heldhaff up as a couple of the sister.
And one day she stack them per accident on a dock of Mao. For this surrounded seven years of despered they were going to dispraced seven years of a year
The pain of Tibet can be unwireless but the freeding spirit of the people of the people are slightly to camp.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of unfortunity or can we live a colorful world of diversity?
The big anthropologists said to her death said to her death that she peace we directioned that we are across a general, amorf world image calcular as a measure.
We would not just look at the human imagination are constrained to a mely, model, but we would have to meet and forgotten that there are other options that there are other options also exist.
We can feel our feel in the idea that our species about 150,000] years on Earth is about 150.] years on Earth is.
The Neolitic Revolution, which we gave our agriculture in which we were replaced to the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the proshaman was replaced by the proshaman by the proshaman by the proshape, I was just about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years.
This surface history that we have to give me the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that will come to our path.
If the intelliligenous cultures of the world to people, the meaning of people, they answered to 10,000 different voes.
And it's in that song that we will discover again that song to be what we are going to discover all the people that are involvesting all the gards to be able to make all the gardens and all the gardens of optimism.
This picture I have this picture in the northern point of Baffin Island when I went to Inextently narwal jays.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextinction, they were put our solid to fight our sout, in the 1950s, to focus in the 1950s,
The opa of Olayuk Olayers.
The family peace for his life and unclearly already him already his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid to the col; they were using it.
The glasses of their keeas became the cross-made from fish in cbooks.
Olayers were not afraid for the pool, or the storm that was highly to the him that wind.
He went out to outside, he was a sea hundred skin, and he was poep, and he started to frozen woman's shaped it as a limmet.
He brought a low-single shaped on the sides of the wheat the sides.
When it was solid, he was to bring a dog med.
He unfelt the dog and improvise a harnames --
Of the riban he made a bad one.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he was going to go over the ice foot and clucks, including pkes.
And this is going to be talked about, in many ways, in many ways, a lot of ways, symbol for the resistance of the Inin and all the inheaded in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Inuit the Inuit the inin the entire conversation of a piece of country than California and Text Nunavut.
It's independent. They remed. They remembers all the so.
It's a bluffecececutive example of how a nation can bit.
And finally, I think it's clearly that it's clearly to these hours of the world is requires of the world is required, that they actually don't get away away to these hour.
They're somebody's home country.
They are going to be in the human imagination, that go back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, are going to be in the unconcerned geography.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely from the idea that politicians never reached anything.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convinced that stories are telling the world, which we probably the best stories that we probably the best stories are in the world, we probably are 35 million times a month, we are in 156 million times in 156 countries on on the month-share our spot public.
We make a felt felt to the foot nosfer to the public, with our public, to us in this particular cultural places, where the increased rate, so that hopefully to the anthropology for the anthropology will go to the anthropology will be absolutely to live in multione, that we can find a way to live in a multiulated way to live in a multionic world and pluralististic world
where all the way wisdom of all the people, can be saying to us become our sementally to our familiar well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book that I have a book in a book of a book.
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some connected to explain that you may have me."
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all Western industrialized society.
And that official dogma is loudle of the well-of-free-to-of-making our neighbors on the highest level, we need to give them so much as as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human beings of human being.
And the things that are freedom is freedom to treat its own insition, to reach a higher well-well-of-shed insides without insides.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices hold people people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-well-well-well-well-of-freedomatically means automatically
This is so deeply dished in our society that nobody would be durvate at it.
And in our lives, this dogma urban requered up.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle growing.
Even about dressings.
Unform that 175 similar beyond there are in my supermarket took 10 different cra-virgin oil and twice photograph, and twenty-vironment.
And that you can make a bunch of own threat, for the case between 175 species for you, there is nothing about 175 species for you.
So that's the farmers of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can do itself your stereoset -- loud spreeakers, cassetttesple -- cassetttesple --
At one electronicawink's just going to get out of this number.
You can put together six and a half million different systems, with parts of parts of those store.
Get me have a lot of choice.
Again, another example -- communication.
When I was young for young for the phone else of telephone of these antists, but Ma Bell.
You didn't hourselves it up. You didn't bought it.
And that was the way that it had never been the properly advanced that it never go.
And that time is fore;
Today there are a lot of different actions.
And in cell phels is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, noso-player, and creering brandandom.
And there are no slight that model in the wincell in the wince; you can sure that happens to be soon.
The follow: people come to the wincle and assume this question.
And you know how the answer to that question ludy?
No, no.
It's not possible to buy that doesn't do a too much to buy that doesn't do too much does not too much much to buy that doesn't do too much much to buy that doesn't do too much as a too much as a too much of too much as a too much of it.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the damage of stuff, this explosive is this explosive explosive to a fact.
Gezoning health care -- it's in the U.S. inmiddle of the things you go to the doctor, and that you tell what you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A doctor, or we can do B to do Bo.
A has this front and after that.
B has this front and nadles?"
And you say, "Dokter, what does you find out of you?"
And the doctor: "A has this front and nadish, and nadishare this front -- and after sharing this front -- and after shar.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do if you was me, what would you do you?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbright of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision is to decide from somebody with somebody who are free in the bottom, somebody who are free free and not the best condition to take decisions, and not the best condition to take -- the patient.
Good forced that neras up, because the goal's group, you can't buy them.
Why advertising, if we can't buy them up?
Because they think that we think we are the next morning our doctors to ask that other mark to ask that other mark for the other market in the other market in the next morning to ask that other mark for the next morning to ask that other market our doctor.
Our identity rate, an aspect of us existing aspect of us existing to choices like you can see in this slide.
Our identity is that we have losed from our background.
We like to find ourselves out -- so we just want.
Every morning, you have to think about what person to be concerned your mind to be thinking about what person want.
Let's talk about marriage, the marriage.
There is a time that freedomatically everybody out of the people went out of the things that you could be married as fast as possible to children began to children began to children
The only real choice was who was not when and what you did was not when and what you did was what you did was what you do --
Now freeze everything to do for the up.
I teach a to eventually intelligent students, which I was event less househwork than househurban than househurban than house.
They are not dommer or air than in the early time in the early time.
No, they have it pressure.
"Do I marrust or not? I’m now marries?
Or will I wait? Do I first children, or a career or a career re?"
These are all set questions.
They go through to them through an answer to them as this means that they don't have their househwork and then they don't have a good catch circle.
And they have the same life. They're important lifese.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just all that technology us to work every minute of every minute of every day -- except that in the Rolph Hotel.
There is one place, by the way, that I love secret that I love it, where Wide it does do.
I don't wlap because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, that huge choice, that we are looking at the time, we were asking us to ask ourselves and again, or not.
We can look at a football weighing our son, with us on our son, with us on the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other hand.
And even if they all all out of these things are coming from that we'd have been asking all kinds of questions, "Am I ask this phone cally?
Am I was going to do this emailing email? I write this letter writing a letter --
And even when the answer is, we experienced the football weightful of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the large, the large, the small, materialistic bags, life is a question of choos; life is a question of choos;
So the world saw the world used to be saw it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choos;
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what is good about is good about what is good about what is bad to talk about what is bad to it.
And that huge choices have two effects, two effects, two negative effects on human being.
A very contradiction is that it before, the paralyzed than conversation is that it works before.
And so many choice.
I'm going to give you a very dramatic, a research to investments in volunted-planness.
A colleague of Vanguard, to invest investment data, a big police, a big police, a big policy with about 2,000 fings.
They discovered that for every 10 policies that have been properly away that the worky that the worky two percent of them that took the works.
At fiftimate froming in five-founds. Why?
Because it is at fifish in fifth of fifth to choose that people just exposed to the following day, and that up, and that up, and that on.
And from the point comes from the challenge is coming out.
That doesn't mean that they don't have any three-foot bread, because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money so hard to eat the choice as hard to feel that they have to do it.
And they were going to have to be 5,000 dollars a year, on their nose.
The worked was very willing to double.
To many choices can be paralyze works.
And I think the world is look like that.
If it comes to the century to the century to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be reseeing up with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that if we had the paralyzing of our dish and choose are finally less racross the result than it would be more than it would be when we had less options have been fewer options as we had go.
There are multiple reasons for to feet.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be the choice didn't look that the choice was not perfect.
You assusuch a case that a case would have been better choice better would have been better.
This dreamed alternative to that you get your choice.
And so, shed the follow-solid of the choice you made it even if it was a good choice that was a good choice choice that was a good choice that was a good choice that was a good choice you have made a good choice you have made a good choice choice you have made a good choice that was a good choice choice cho
The more options are there to be the more option, it's to have uncome, and the influence of the codd options.
A second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
Dan Gilbert gave catch as often how often we depend the value of things that we are equal things that we comparing them.
If you can inthink, many alternatives can inthink, you see many alternatives of all the alternatives that you detect the end.
That makes you fear that you have calternative that you have chosen you've got calternative that you have chosen to be bate.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers below under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stressing of this example.
This is a set on valife's Hamptons.
They have a throw two.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend weather. No one human beings.
Don't do it? "Do dikkly thinks that man, "It's careful right?
Everyone in my neighborhood, Manhattan is the city outly.
I could fly my car for the door to the door parkers,
And he's about two weeks of them that he miss a great parking place that he misles.
Secececstitutional cost of the entire choice that we have, even if we make a great choice choice.
The more possibilities, there are the more contrackable alternatives are there.
And those presents are present as a substitutic costs.
Another example.
This image story, this image of a number of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to considered things to get away to get away to get things to consider.
Another point is that you exclude other choice.
And all of that other has so attracted optional options, which is calcular calcularies,
And third is the escalation of expectances.
I came up with this is my quest to a new breeding to a new breeding breeduring for a new breet.
I walk almost always spirit almost always speak --
Beat the bought one, and you bought it bought you, and it bought it was incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were going to be incredibly enough and often enough to be enough and often enough to be enough enough to do it OK.
And after years I went to the store for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to do a spirit is my me."
And the winter said, "Would you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed fit fit fit fit?
Do you whether a rit? Would you be stone-washed or acid?
Do you want to make a breek effect?
Would you be a little bit of pipes, or flink out of pipes." And so he went on.
I was spoke of it. I said, "I want the only job that was said, "I want the only one."
He had no idea what breeding that was and so I have a hours of all the possible bits are converss.
First of all, I left the wincle eventually eventually with a extended breet.
I had done better -- I could do it better. I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Or do this to myself, I wrote a book of a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of this choice, was that I started expect to expect of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of a good speak of a good spirit.
I started without any any expectancy, because I just know one kind of spirit known.
Then there was different from there was different ware, and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I reach my breek with my bird with my expect to my expect of expect me teleur.
The more possibilities, people have to have more expected to be expected to do the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less racks, even as the results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in the really goes to do it in really well.
Everything was bad better,
Because when everything was based, people could have a lot of surprising experiences.
In our modern society can we as a well as a well citizens perfection, but the best thing we can ever achieve -- but the best thing that we have to reach in the way.
Nonce we become surprised because our expectations, my expectances, and high-high-up.
The secret of happiness -- this is to you, the secret of happiness is not too much expect to be happiness is not too much expect.
I want to have a little bit -- a carbiographically elementary -- that I was a woman who is really greatly fantastic is really great.
I didn't have a little less racequipment.
But less enoughs to take up with his good opportunity.
And finally, when you sit is a bad sat a bad bad as there is only one kind of predicts -- you can ask you ask to why you intished why you intacks.
The answer is that case feel simple.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different trical, and you buy it turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just as simple. That's just as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different marks you don't have excuse to fal.
So if the people are decided to make people decision, even as the results of those decess, they are teleurated about their choice.
And they take themselves quale.
In the Western society clinic depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations.
A factor -- not the one, but it's a significant factor in this explosive suddenly depression and suicide self-killed experiences are that people have to be in their high expectancy.
And if they try to explain that teleurpose to explain themselves the debt of themselves the debt of themselves the ded.
So the nettoress, so that we were going to have to do objective forward to forward our bads.
As a containing together a constitution.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody gets to where is being being on the way to where they are going to be able to where they are.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffers no doubt that can choose better than they can't choose to be able to choose out of automatically choice is better choice is better choice is even better.
There is a magic foundly choical possibilities. Well I don't know.
But I know that we have been freedom of the point that choices us well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-seving.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best one.
The choices freedom in industrialized countries come out of material considered free-freedom.
There are many places on the world, there we already talking about where the problem is not so much choice, but it's too much choice, but there is too few choice.
So the paradox that I speak to the modern, so that we have to do the modern, well-well.
That's frustrated, and it's all the straight one, you told you that expensive and hard to installing kids are not helping children are not helping your money.
I tell you the same about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to go to the shake to the way to do it.
They make our lives less value.
If part of what people in our society is able to make all those choices to make all those choices that people have been talking about to some operations, life would be able to go forward to be able to go forward.
And our lives living to go forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everyone is better by reverse by requirement -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choices that we carry with our behaviors that we carry with our behavior.
Finally, if you learn this picture story like this, you know, you know, if you were developed to say, "Ah, what the fish that fish is there now?
Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A scree imagination, a short worldview, that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it, I think, the better I understand that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this to the hand: If you get the fish crazy to create possibilities, you have no freedom, you don't have freedom.
If you get the fish crazy to create possibilities, you get less to create the fish crosses.
It leads to more disconnected and less racid.
Everyone has a fish crazy.
This is freedom, certainly even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the desire-fish fish, is asking to ask is questions to miserable, distributed, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
