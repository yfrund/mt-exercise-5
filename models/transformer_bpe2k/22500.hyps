Last year I showed these two slides to show that the police, which the polline of the vast three million years of the vast three million years of the vast three million years with 40 percent of the United States, 40 percent of the United States,
But this particular problem is the nice of this specific problem because it doesn't make the divice.
The ice apurpose is in a certain sense, is a certain sense, sheart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a celled version of what the past 25 years is happening 25 years.
The permanent ice is red.
As you see, it turned out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent ice ice ice five years or parent, almost like blood, is almost like blood, that comes out of the body is sicks.
In 25 years is the from this to this got.
And that's a problem because the frozen floors around the North Icelation and there is a very big amount of womeless womeless womeless whilse when it die, when it was dead, by microbes that it was death, and it is a death,
And the number of the total amount of the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, that could be double that can be double to the amount of the atmosphere.
In some indeep, inside Alaska breborrely of the water.
And the last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different sheps.
Why! She's OK. The question is going to be that whether we will be.
A reason for that, is that this huge "warm-bron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melectwater river.
The water volume evolve the greater than equipe.
This is the Kangerlussua's river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sea because it comes agricultural because it's landips, it's the place where it comes into the sea --
These are flow out of these are flu.
On the other side of the planet on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass ice mass on ice mass on Earth.
For the last month, reported scientists that the whole continent now, the whole continent now,
More specific is the ice of the South Pole.
The whole continent state for six feet sea single stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice mass, there are new now, there are new now, and a few years ago.
40 percent of the global population is the half of his drinwater is going to be single tims.
In the Andes, is this glestjer the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are more stroms.
But when they disappears also disappears the drink-water.
In California was a reducation of 40 percent in the snow,
It comes in the water reservoires of reservices.
And as you could read the predictions are going to be severe to it.
This global dreaming has led to a dramatic styer of forests.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen seent.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the prevent 75 years.
This pattern is completely unket.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 applies every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, every day in our oceans, and look at the United States, from America, restire, and every single squatch of Indian subcontinent, there is a behavistal dalation of the ocean daling daling, there is a behaviors in the oceans.
The only major causes of the Earth, next to deforestation, which is the source of the Earth, is the source of fossil fuel stunes.
Olie is a problem, and steenkool is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the two biggest of the two biggest of China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more urban carbon carbon carbon centrales.
But we see a circumulate
These are the coal-carbon which the bulls was annuated in the last years, and where green alternatives were readepted in the last years,
There's a political straight on the glowed in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industry gave 250 million dollars to promote "clean emergency coal coal coal coal coal coal is a conversation.
And that view that was a little bit of a thinking about something that was thinking about it.
And the guy was at the home in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally calculated gallons of cooling carbon model.
You probably seen it in the news of news in the news of news.
This is the one after one after set up in America.
This was going around the Kerst.
One of the adversation shape, the cooolines was the Kerstonish.
Video: ""Frosty the steenkical carbon man is a key churban guy guy.
He is foverfluence here in America, and he cares on the America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the urban carbon man is scone.
He is paid and cute and working on their job."
Here is a big part of the urban coal in West Virginia froms.
The biggest mines of the country is the great blaunch of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship -- "Let me be. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rether, they don't know where they talk about what they haven't talked about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "BuCOALergy, we see the climate change, as a serious threatening for our things.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to give us a giant goal is to give a giant to the light and bring the light and bring the truth of value carbon carbon.
Fit is, steenkool is not smarket is not smart.
We find that it shapes -- and it still seems to be more resed.
So, you don't make worried about climate change.
Let me just go on to our it.
Video: Acrrace carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon it.
So let's take a look, you take a hyper-scale cools of cools centrale.
Fantastic. The machines make pretty much as well as a little lay.
But that's the sound of clean cools technology.
Despecially the fact that the branes of the main causes of the main warming warming of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth, the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at good around the short carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Eince past-positive alternative alternative alternative alternative security.
Video: Stem: America wrong of crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wireless wirels, is our dependence of fossil fuel stoffs, like vulness collapse and craped oil.
But now there's a killed new solution to get out of this.
Forth America 100 percent shapes of electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get to the America to work on the work on the Earth is a security and the warming of the Earth is and warming the Earth to.
And in fact, a solution that requires to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our took on the way.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about the America to give America to energy.
One of the quickest ways to make an enduring away to our dependence of old fuel fuel fuel of old fuel that our planet to help see.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, shape.
And they walk two, well, you know, the investments to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There is an old African speaking: If you want to be soon to be soon and well.
If you want to go far far to collabor."
We have to go far far and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called a update about how that machine working with a update about how that works.
So here I am now, I am not going to go on -- the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever underneath in the entertained in the entertain in the enters.
It has to be the circumstances that were dealing a billion-second after the universe began to be 600 million times a second after the universe began to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, s!
This is the machine Genevil.
We took pictures of that the mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one that I'm working with the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet big.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in arban so you can see the scale.
And at 10 seple year we put the machine for the first time we first put the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a partor in the control room in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle straight that was all around the way around the LHC was going to go around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, because of particles in the detector in the detector sotor song.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September 10September we knew that worked is a huge over.
I don't know if this the biggest across or this, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet pages out of the Internet page looked like this.
That means we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientists
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
And those draws of the bities of a thousand amper when the machine working entirely power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's not true. It's too small behaviors to be.
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be flowing that flows that flows up and shape.
And in one of the connections between the nine of the nets in the LHC, was a constructive.
It was going to be a wire on the wire was inelestant resistance against that 13 thousand ampeering electric response to 13 thousand ampeering.
This was the result.
This is still insultimate if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons -- and they were about 30 cenches in the way.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to look at them out out what we did it.
We all took them when we all display them as well.
Now they are back on a road.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We'll go back and put it back and we expect measures in juni, or right so we can go on and look at the expect of the universe.
Now, of course, that have insounces the debate again the value of scientific research. It's easily to research.
I think it's actually that it's a hard to be so hard to go further than the one is the value of things like the LHC.
I show the last words on the English scientist Humphor, I would have been defend up to the define of the value experiments of the value experiments of his teaching teaching was Michael Faral Faral Faral Faral than the human mind than the human mind than to take the progression than the images of science than mysteries are not a mysteries in the nature, and that there are no new gurbing of the world's reseverse of the new world, and that there are not a new world's neature of the world's nexttermining of the other thing that there are not a new world's newingle of the new new world, and that ontentiston't discdiscdiscdiscususususususussions
Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you to ask you to get to your children's time when you played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it up to it, and then they cut up and conscious, you actually solve problems through the engineering and hangs from space relations.
Rumtelevision is destront of the world to understand the world
If an information is inspired by the physical interact with objects -- and then with objects -- together with objects -- and with my fise Pattion and my compassion of Kalanithi -- I began to ask -- what if we would have a computer -- what if we would have a computer of digital finger on the environmental vinger that moves on a plate freaudiency with the information that would be information with physical vice, which would be information with the information of information with the other thing that would have to be information with the information of the hands of the handsquipididididididth of information of the phy -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- that one one one one one one one one one
and you can ordern as we want to it?
And these question him is so consider that we decided to see an answer, by building Siftables.
Sort collaborate is a Siftable computer size a cooknet.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel together their movement detect and they fatttes a shape, and they free a shape.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands blocks as blocks as blocks that can be moved by grabs.
And the top of the Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this helped a more physical difference, and even from each other, and even from each other, and even from each other, and even from the way we move them from each way we move them are different new and fun interactions of interactions of the way we move them to explore them from the way we move them from their movement.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instoned to tell a video that allows up to the cell opposite and others playing other song, and others playful.
This interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they are surround, they also care they also and can be a little narrow and some nice.
And they feel movement and calling them movement.
We realized that one of the interesting thing about the interesting consequences of these interaction, the use of everyday is gesture of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluquot.
In this example, three Siftables emmers to go and go to go color in a lower and I can use them to go color in a good.
If we have over-driving over the time.
There are some couple of crapy for education, mathematics and logic playing, mathematics and logic and logic that we want to give things quickly things quickly immediately shape.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci running through a simple accell programative programative programative programative programative programative programative programative programmmate.
Here we show a game is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get around a willling letter to get on every Siftable, and causes are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is very rescue, and applies a new series of letters with the equalities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm trying to make them out and I put them out and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these applies is that people needed almost no instructions of the most interesting thing is needed instructions of the most interesting things that are needed to have an instructions of these applies are almost interesting things of these applies are going to have instructions of the most interesting thing is that people needed up to
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people on the test of the other people test it.
That's our youngest ber is tester, rightening.
And it turns out he just couldn't staples.
For him this blocks.
Here is a interactive paintings.
We wanted to learn a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just returning the Siftable with that character of the table with the table.
Here he leaves the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene fashion.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good god! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttles and the next next to each other, and the next next next next to each other, he can react the characters with each other -- Video: Wah it -- Video: Wake the characters with each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end up with an open end.
and he decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show Is a synthesia, and live music and live music instrument that we developed recent a sound product like the lead, bass like the lead, bass and pressed.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the lege of the sounds can be injected to certain in it.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a soundly Siftable effects of a livable effects like reverb and filter.
They are going to be sound to a sound and adapted by the sound.
And the general effects like templo and volume that are allowed to the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, length by an extra lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I'm now fellow a little bat.
Video: And now I cope the movie of the drums, so I can affect live can affect the effect of lives.
Video: I can spend it very quick by the sequence of the sackle of the blocks.
Video: DM: Now I cope the movie for what's more expression.
Video: I can reach the pattern as it playt.
So I don't have to be able to planns, but I can improvise everything and make it very longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And finally, the dimmal the dimses of the volume Siftable to left Siftable to left shed.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is to make new people, my passion computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better in the way our brain and body works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of element, with some opportunities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring is that this is just the consider is to a very new generation to a very new generation for the interacting with digital media, which brings the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at them to talk to you with all of you to all with you and all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also writing more than that.
My whole life long, I am write for writing and I don't think that will change anyone will change it.
And yet there is infitive something happened in my life and career and career on my relationship with my work again.
It began with a book that I've wrote that I've written wrote a memoire: "E, Bidd," which is very very contradiction to my first work.
The consequence is that people now have to be all over and always told, as if I do I do it.
And that is what -- -- gets -- go!
People come to me and ask me and ask it to me and ask you that success you can never eat this succe?
Don't you get to write your whole life will keep you write your whole life will be a book supposed to where people will walk warm.
Do you don't have to do that,
And I remember, you know.
Of course, that would be very much like I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I was a teenager.
People said, "Don't you afraid you have never succeed?
Don't you get to afraid you to go on it to go on it.
Don't you get your life to this work is that you will have to be able to be something out there is something out of your bitter-single bitter-bitter-bitter-bitter-axed bitter?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short, my answer to that questions on this novel is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough.
All of the time
But I'm also a lot of other things bang, you don't know what everything for everything for everything for everything for it.
For sea of sea whose and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time that comes froming up to what comes from.
Is it ratione?
Is it logical that somebody is to be working for working for working for their mention on Earth are on Earth are see?
What is that creative processes that we make sure that we make sure the effects of the mind of the mind of the mindness of the mind thing that doesn't happen.
Take me my dad. He was scaled to engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he worked on him that he was ever asked to him or he was not afraid to him or he was not afraid to him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to be my
And so, "Yeah, how do it with your chemistrieblock?"
No, no, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been by the centuries of the centuries and they also haven't crazy the reputation of manicalls.
Scheate, which have a kind of reputation.
Not just writer, also other creative people have been instable, the reputation mental instable, instable.
And look at the grimmy dodental death the magnife of the 20th century.
And many dies are froms, often by own own stiered by own it.
And even the ones that no suicide suicians who are under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave today.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of mitry."
That's a little bit about saying about your lifest.
But of this kind of expensive we don't look at it.
We all heard it before, and have it with my all and considered it with my all the time.
The shaped is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity will be insultistate will lead to the square going to lead to misere.
So I want to ask everyone here today I ask everyone here today?
Do you go to that.
Because I'm going to talk about it, I think I think about it, I think it's not a little pretty much more wrong day.
I think the reads of the readed.
And also more dangerous as well.
I wouldn't like this century is that this century is so on.
We can create much better than we can sport much better to live in it.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my mind.
In fact, the fase where my career is in which my career now.
Go tune tell: I'm still young, among a teach.
I can go through the decades and maybe four decades.
And the Hoogstion, probably will be everything I now now now have been seeing the outside world as the work that extraordinary book.
And we're here with friends under each other, so I can sell you can be sell you is my biggest successful, my biggest successful,
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about it is you to know that you know the morning to negorate negord hours to the deaper.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to work with the work that I love to work that I'm like that.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go with write if I built a psychological protection in the process inside the process ine.
I have to create it writing a safe distance between mitself and my concerned and my convert fear of reactions, and my very understanding published on my future publications.
I just just past year to ways to do that.
I'm in history in the history and I do deeps in other civilient in other civilions of the things that have found out of the creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has a square me to the old Greeks and Roman and Romons.
And I have a long and it was a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Roman and Roman and Romestic was not that creativity of themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a godddless, which was a fre, unknowledge to human beings came accountable to human reasonable reasonable reasonable for fage reasons.
The Greeks called these calls called these creativity mines of creativity "demons."
And Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that influstened him words influstene.
The Romenon had a species of the Romay had a kind of same idea.
And I think about them was a severe creative mind creative mind a geni.
The funny is that the Romestic with a genius with a genius to be a particular pient.
In their policy was a genius a magical godd-magical godd-craft and the walls of the ateler of the poorest of the poor.
A little bit like Dobs the house.
If the artists was the working was on the genius assistance.
And he gave he gave to the work.
Brilliant! That's the exactly I had the distance I first had the first time about the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to go to his work on his work work.
The artists was so in protection to the pressure was in protection to a much narcism.
If you were brilliant working on the one, you don't have all the one.
Everybody knew that had a invisible genion, which you had to have oil your invisible genius
And you know, you got a work, then you cut out of you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Long time is that the West, the West, the West, creativity was considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there is a very new ideas is a very new idea: the individual human is the middle of the universe and state all gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attention from the godd-to-sent world.
That was the beginning of rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual --
And for the first time in history in the history was there about artists said that they were a genion, and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I find a big front of a big froms.
To one person one person, one -- one one person, one that he or she is a vehicle of the century, the source of the century, the source of the century, of everything else -- that's too much responsible for a fragiment, is a lot of responsible human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun into sketch a single sketch of sop.
Ego's become re-built proportions and there are increasingly expectations to prestate.
And I think that this drug has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists of artists.
If that's that is, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not maybe
And we can make 500 years we can rationally rationally rationally not unundan 18 minutes.
And it probably in the audience people who have reduced scientific doubt of the idea that elphysics with what fact is that elphraoration of the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring up to inspiring high-like inspiring artists of the audience to inspiring the idea that else of artists to inspiring the idea that else of the audience of the audiences of the idea that el
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in that I will get to you in it.
And yet, I ask it out.
Why now?
Why wouldn't we have that thought don't have to do it?
It just felt as much as all the other explanations of the total calculation of the total calcular that is including including in the creative process.
Everybody who have something that has to create -- so in fact, and so in fact, all the attackle here -- you know that the creative process doesn't always rationally become rational process is not always rationally straight to rationally rationally income.
And that it sometimes almost paranorms.
I have the great American closer to the amazing American closer Ruth Stone of the great.
She is a closer to the nine. Her whole life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the planet and of Virginia.
Somes, if she was felt on the work was felt on the work, and they have a poems, over the country.
It was so though she said, "Well, if there was a big wave air.
And a poem golf over the country to her country to her
She felt the ground, and she knew her feet began to shake her at that point and he knew her at the point of her life.
And she ran home, and she had to go and soon through the close and then she had to do as quickly as quickly as possible.
When the poem by her hundred by her hundred was that her only chance to write it on the waves of it.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then she rough, but calculate, but couldn't go on house.
And at the point of shape, the poem by her him, and so, search -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And then there were a lot of the story -- I think I think the most beautiful part of the story -- that they close the poem almost miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper and paper the paper and shaped it by her and shape.
Junew at that point she had a potased to do it.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she told me the poem out of the air.
She paked the close to his tail, and it back into her body, and it back into her body, and she wrote it back into her body,
And in those cases came up with the paper that was in the paper and then in the paper and then it was following up in the end.
And when I heard that -- I thought I heard that -- what is applying is that my creative process ey!
And this is how my creative process! I'm not a medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouth, which is a mouth, who is on the same time chairs and sweat, and trans on the blood, and trans on it.
But even in that days I've had a shape, I have a experience.
You also know it myself to know it yourself, that feeling creative ideas in your expensive ideas in your source that you can identifies.
What is that then is that for bron?
How can we use it without that we become that without the one?
And one way that we have to do for us is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician's Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life is the shows of the crazy artistic artists that are out of all power corner to get out of the unconcern of the unconnection in him that refrigerable in him.
And the years was Tom was a little bit more more than a little bit more rorer.
And one day he was in Los Angeles about the fasth and changed the process racevent process.
And as he got there, he heard a fragment, he heard a fragment,
And the decided to it, as inspiration that is degrab, crazy.
It was a nice melody and he wanted to further it was going to be a beautiful melody and he wanted to follow it was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fur.
But that doesn't go to that.
He had no paper -- he had no paper at a taneously at a time.
The well-calculated spance again, is called "I reach the celodies and then it stays and then it stays to me become the century.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get a bunch panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I'm behind the stuff behind the stuvernans?"
"Do you really think I can write a song,
If you really want to be able to come to you have to be later, you have to adapted when I have time for you've got time for you.
Don't do anyone else to somebody else else.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohene." And from that point the process of the process of different.
The work is the work itself, with the dark of the dark submersible.
But the sheavy exciting that the creative process in him reseparate of the genius.
The genion, he was going to close on the skin and living only but he catched up.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go on it.
It could also be an amazing collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the propertile aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I have been profit from it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle -- Beminning shape.
And at a point moment I move in despair.
You know that you want to be working and you don't want to be a terrible disasting that it is a terrible so. The book ook ook a horrible book a single book of it.
Not just just just bad -- not just bad that is really horrible bad of it.
I wanted to go to the whole project all of the project all of the project all of the project of the project all of the project
And then I remember Tom that was going to his genius who are genius to be a potent.
I wendded me from my manuscrips, and focus cripped to a fun of the room.
And I said, "Lost thope, we know that if this book is not just brilliant is not just because of this book is not just by me.
You can see that I put everything in what I've got in what I have in my thing.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better, you have to do you've got to do your thing.
Se? Do you don't do that, you don't do that, you've got your.
I just write because that's one time my work.
Oh, and in the notate is that are going to be square just dish to be appropriate on cantor appropriate on cantor apos."
Twa -- Us: Usings it here at the novel of it
Eut, Eut, there was in the North African desert African desert people together to months on the sacred music.
Ors and hours and hours to the morning to the morning birth.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be a very single one.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen with that you have ever seen something at a performer.
It was like the time was stilling and the dance and the dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now I have everything together.
And he didn't have a long time he didn't have a human beings a human being.
In him, under him bite, on him blows.
A goddly furing him.
If you did something called Dan something called Dan people what it was began to clap them and clap them and clap and clap them and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was it for them.
And by the way, a fun historic fact, when the Moren South Spanish Spanish Spanish Spainting, they brought these habiting habiting with it.
The choice is the crazy is by the centuries and shake of "Allah."
That you hear to have the today at the day at the day and flaments and flaments and flamengovernments today's today's today.
If an artists in Spain a slightly inpossible, or magical goes, "Allah, olone, oh, great, both shape, bough."
Anounderstanding of God.
And recipe we need.
Lastig is the dance is that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the dinary ladyer to the dinsdam of 11 hours in the morning laddless lady.
And at that point is a little parentor man with cooperhaps that will come up to such a little high.
Maybe there will be a little bit of a while, there will be a while,
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's a hard to it.
That's really hard to sell a creative mind for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be that painting.
Imagine you don't have to be the most indesit aspects of your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe you have them a while you don't have a while to a while.
When you ready it, they are going to be given to someone else.
And it was how to be considered to be everybody.
I hang inevent that thought.
The last months I've worked on a book that will be short. It will be short. It will be a lot of where a lot of it is going to be extended to be extincluding out to is extension.
The operating that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the hall, I love me and the same on: You know, I don't have it.
Do just you work.
So if you just do thing you do and what it's also is.
If you have task you to dance your job is going to dance you,
If the goddless the goddless you is concluding to your work at some point at some point at some point of wonderful sources, then "Oly!"
And it doesn't go to that not, thank you on it but won't go on it.
And then, "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe
"Olen!"Se!"" because we have pure human love and properties of human love and propertile by pluing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, on!
You know, I have been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovering of new sets of genes.
We actually start to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digital issue and now we try to go from those digital code to a new phase in biology with the design and synthesize of the biology and synthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's living to be something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand different levels,
We tried approaches different approach to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years to the digitize
And when we sequenced the human genome genome we sequenced the analoge world of the analoge world of the computer.
Now we try to ask and ask regenerate regenerat, or we can create new, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genomes for a kind of that can conceive themselves, in a laboratory fills in a laboratory fill.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a nature for a little genom.
We can go to the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or both that are there.
But if we look at the metabolical map is that relatively simply removed with the inses.
Geloof me, this is simply simply to me.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check a piece of the genes that would be a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell that would be a living cell cell cell cell the genes that would be a living cell cell cell cell cell
And we decided that the only rout, the only route was to synthesize this chromosome of components so we could deal the components to be a few fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started a chromosquit?"
Staat the chemistry, to make this very large molecules, that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosquito.
A chromosopm is but a piece of chemicic inates material.
So, our shapes of digitize of digitize is accelerate on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slose slowly slowly, but is it to be a little shape.
And our last point that would put it on the moment on a exponential curve.
We're going to be more than 15 years ago.
There were some stadia for a number of stadia bio-ethical ethical action of the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to it.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lengths, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it pieces are of the things that are going to be more faler you make it pieces are of the world --
So we had to make a new method for the tincluding of these little pieces and correct of all the bodys.
And this was our first pogonation, begin with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria deate.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part began when we put a piece of chemical stant chemical stant in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code and virtues, and virtually go and make virtual particles and virtual particles and virtual particles are going to make a virale piece of the bacteria --
The viral particles were going to solve when they came out of the cells, they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was under to speak with the oil industry, and I said they would have to be model.
They laughing more than you love.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software is building its own hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromoses.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we decided to build them in cassettes at the size of viruses, so we could various the cassettes --
to go to understand what the deeply components of a living cell cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very accurae.
When we first assume to this genome together in 1995 was the standard-precision one mistake a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 pals. If we had the original sequences than it was not able to start to start to start to start to start to start to start it.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters who have to be agreed with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build single slightly smaller sub-simply sub-simply subject.
We design here unique parts in here.
Maybe you have a read that we stopped in it.
But, we think we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, Geuttery and T.
Trio's from those letters cos for the rubs of the letters cos -- that there is a literal invitation for every aminoxyous.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, seeing seen.
And we have a little signs we just care about it.
Some of them were teleggs were not purpose there were no purposed to be closed up.
We have these pieces of pieces that we can eat them with anzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and together.
And we started to make pieces of pieces that are five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have 24,000 letters for 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stadium we weeket, we have a flooring of these pieces so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robities -- that will you see straight you see straight you'll see them out of any stadiverse --
We try to achieve the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow as easily more in E. coli.
That explains the explains of all modern tools of the modern tools of molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA pieces of sanch together.
Here is an example.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation to radiation of radiation to radiation of radiation is three million radiation of radiodurans for the radiation of radiodurans --
And you see that you see in the top panel of the top panel sopm just just out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it back into each other, exactly like it was first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be dried up to be totally dread.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there are living in space, that can promove to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of it, there are many of it,
Here is a deeply microph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually actually with these processes with just yesterious mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did them in the right design of the pieces that we did.
And it turns out that she feed automatically together.
This is not an electron-microscope photograph. This is a ordinary microscope.
It's a big molecules, we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes are taking a six seconds.
This is the publication that we spend up under under under the couple of the publication that we have inses.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by humans, with a clearing structure.
The molecules, over 300 million.
If we would go to a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages to pressupposed to the genetic code.
Now, how do we started, how do we start a chromosquito we start it? How to do we do?
And with a virus is clearly pretty easily.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give your eukaryots, like us, you just know the cell and do another in and does another one and does another in and do another in, and that's what you know when you know when it been.
And if you can see the bacteria is the chromosquitom in the cell, but we have regs to show that we can have a complete transpllantation of a chromosopm from a chromosing transplant to an other, and can activate the activate of a cell transplant to another one.
We have a chromosopm of a micro-size of a micro-size.
These are about as far as people and moving and muizing.
We feed some extra little bit so that we could select for chromosquito.
We have it to make it with anzymes to make all the eggs to make all the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we stopped this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of cell.
We even thought he would come to square to soon, but we tried to go out the process of what further.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of these kinds that have a second chromosquitom or a thousands or a thousands of properties in one times, they add extension.
People that evolution are going to be a lot of biology changes have not been much biology as if there are one of biology
There are enzymes that restrictive enzymes are called DNA.
The chromosopm that was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosh that we stopped -- well,
It became expression, and the other chromosquitom as a strange material, and so we finally had the cell of the new chromosophim.
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the one species of the species, and changed it in the new software that we in the new software that we had in the cell shape.
All the protein changes, the membranes changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a main the software alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things that are the software DNA, to change things fundamental today.
Good, I've been paying that this is not a creation -- this is the previous -- this is previous for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I've paid a new version of the Cambrical explosion, of the Cambrical explosion, which there are making new species of new species of new species of things,
Why would you do it?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what it's pretty much as you need what it is.
We're going to go inside of six-and-a-a-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 46; within 46,
We have to have food with food, with the heavil, medicine, fuel for the six-and-a-a-a-a-half billion.
That is a diverse to do that for now.
We use five billion tons collects, more than 30 billion ves.
That's 100 miloons of ves;
When we take biological processes in ogency or what process is to replace; then it is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, is all that carbon dioxide of the stant that comes in the atmosphere is really going to be able to be the atmosphere is a front of the atmosphere is a little bit of the stone of the stone that comes in the atmosphere is all the carbon the atmosphere is that carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is all of the atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is from there is forget from there is forget from there.
We're making on a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques of synthesial synthesize called combination genomics.
We've now got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the conversation of 20 million different genes or trying to optimalizing processes to make octan octon or drugs or drugs, new vaccines, we can change with a little team of team cular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just just standard selection.
We can select for living vatbirth, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen major image of what real design design software where we can actually go on the gang and a new kind of on the computer of computer.
We don't know how it will look like to see what it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like this.
We fourselves fourth of fuel today.
Our longs have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come out of sugar will come out of sugar to more higher fuels like octon or sunch of buttanolid.
But the only way we think we think that biology can have a big influence is without the food price higher and the availability is to lay as we start with CO2 as his food supply, and why are we fact, and why we think we are cells that we do the first fourth generation of the first generation of the first generation of the first generation brands within about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries are other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles on the deep, at cost of the depths of shape.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecular water source.
We're looking at the CO2 CO2 we can take CO2 which is easily through pipes can be fabriess, where that is is going back to brandstoph, to send this process.
So in a short of a short point we think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is living to the basic question: "What is living in the basic question: "What is living to the basal question: "What is living in a short of a short of a short of a short of a short
We realize you know -- you have -- the deadededegrades of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do this, where then you can't do it?
A major energy source is going to be a major energy source.
But we also work on the tools of these tools to be quickly servaccines of vaccines to think about it.
This year there was the flu, we always walk just a little behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change from textile and combined vaccines that can make it changes from text.
Here you see how the future can go through the evolution bottom is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still away from the improve of people.
Our goal is certainly to survive we make a chance to survive for long,
What I want to show you as a first quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft is about a year ago. This is Seehavior. This is Seehavior.
And it's a environment where you can local or at the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work out of the data can work
We look at the way here are many gigabytes to digital images and can keep up here on and expanding the and except the sort and the sorttering and the sorttering to our wise.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library or Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel of the Library camer's 300 megapixel of the Library camer's
It all doesn't matter anything because it would be the only thing that would influence, on a third of the same pixeless of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, a very example of not-image that is a completely book,
This is the graduate house by Dickens. Each cold is a headdn.
To evidence that it's really text, and no imagination, we can do something -- we can do something to show that this really is not a imagination.
And maybe this is a little strange way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read.
I wouldn't be adapt.
This is a realistic example. This is a kind of the Guardian.
Each big image is the beginning of a subject of a supposed to a bottom.
This is really a fun, and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something with the corner of this extension.
We have a nepasts of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the possibilities of these car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can really make the limitations of hands, through the screen through the screen through the screen of the shape.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more means and other third flawwo -- not need to be more than it will be more than it will be more than it will be more flaul -- not need to be more popular flaul -- not need to be more pop-ups ups more pop-ups ups ups
Of course, the landsks are a circular cle of the entirely for a technology as this: I will not spend here to this field, except that we can also be a lot of the work.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connected two techniques connected with each other.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision research by Noah Snavely, promoting to the University of Washington, ago by Steve Seitzing University at University at University of Washington University of Washington and the University at University of Washington and the University of Washingty.
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible of Seadragon.
When we do this, you see we can see that we can see through the images, and the multi-resolution resolution.
The space shake of the images has this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have built so they have the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes -- where they are genommic diashosplay or ptures, and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is a different environments to show up and other environments.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space.
I want to have one of Noah's original data, and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summernth that we worked on the consider of the communicate is the realm of this technique, the realization of this technique, at the environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from Flickr.
And each of these orange chirrchics that turn a image of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model again.
And so these are all these Flickr images, which are in this way space copied to be copied in this way of space --
And we can be a simple way way we can do it.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft would work at Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is that under to become so on.
I believe you can see that this is cameras are cameras are cameras are that all of girlreflexcameras a big number of it, considered in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much more than it to be so much by face and the same one.
And somewhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is well-chured by the program.
If we have four through the poster in a physical picture, in a physical picture.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, this is now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entive memory of the entire collective memory that everything to each other.
All these photographs are considered together, and shapes a very bigger than the single of the parts.
You have a model that is a model that is all the Earth is going to be a model that is going to be a model that is going to be a model that is all the Earth is going to be a model that is all the Earth is going to be a model that is all the Earth is a model that is going to be a model that is going to be a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth.
As a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it when they use it to the people who are growing for the people who uses it.
Their own pictures are going to be able to see metape data that somebody else invet.
If someone all these hidden would like to climb their names and their names and their names is going to be rich and then I can be agree with all of those data, and I can use as a access to the space, that metap-versum usbycle versus of cruise model, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product of this imments are an imments of every interesting place of every interesting place on Earth, who not only photos, satellite images and other applies and other applies is defined, but also from the collectively -- but also out of the collectively pursus is a couple of the collectively photographs, and then it is a massive race of this is an immension.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you can make some software possible on a day, in the next years, all the images that are dealed by everyone in the world can copy together in the world can copy together in the world can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It creates, it create, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the images.
And that is going to be reflecting when you think about the richches of semantic information that much of these images are going to have to be available to have a lot of these images are available to be available to have a lot of semantic information that is conclude from these images are available to be available to have the richcheice.
When you look for image to imagine a web and you have a sophisticated and the text on the webpage pages of information about what the image is going to be a lot of information about what the image is going to be a lot of information about what the image of information is the image of information about what the image is going to be a lot of information about what the image is going to be a lot of information about what the image is going to be far information about what the image of information is going to find out of information about what the image and then you fount is going on to find is going on to imaged.
What if you have the image is that copied to have your image?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth riching richches that comes out of that. It's a classic networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitors.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and enographical research is the possibility to live between those who are the old living in the won't forget their past, who are feel in the wind, the casking in the wind, the profishing of the purposed stones, the profitere.

So it can't be surprise that we all see, and dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique clas of the song, and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is about the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the U.S. Caision, or the Caisuta Caisut-de-wood desert in Nord-Kenya, the Curban Buil-Back of Caravanai in the heart of the Sahara. This is the heart of the Sahara. This is the desert of the desert of the desert -- or a majornan hellyaknnangma, or nonow, or nosh the Cath,

They all are us all that we can be different, we can think of the Earth can be oriently.
If you think about it, you can just give you a lot of you just give hope you hope.
Samen shapes the intelligence cultures in the world of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the biological life web, the biosphere.
This cultural life couple of life couple of enos;
The enosed feature of the enos; you can define as the total of all the thoughts, my mind, mythes, and inspirations that are conscions and intuitions that are consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.

She is the symbol of all that we can be and all that we can be amazing and all that we can be amazing animals.
And not as the biosphere is the eat, is the enosed is that ook-- and and in much bigger mate.
No biologist would be following that the minsts of all the species on the point of all species on the point of extincluding is not true.
And then, the most apocalyptic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhoods of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing is the loss.
And then everyone here was born there, there were sixes on Earth was born.

They have a copy language and humanly regular rules, which is linguistic exogample, you have to married a different language.
These are roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary entire in their houses, or seven languages or seven languages or seven language, but you never have a language.
They simply simply and then start speaking and then then then you know.
One of the fascinater tribes that I've lived with the Waorani in Norani in North Ecuador, a sequence of 1958 village in 19588, which was recomact on which was recomet out of the fascinate.
In 19557 tried five missionars, but they made a critical phorics were critical eral.
And the air, they cut photographs of itself with friendly building these friendly building birth of the airs of which they had never seen a two-dimensional image.
They got the photographs and tried to find the face.
And then they didn't found, they were concludes that the thuel of them with this square with speaking them with speaking circle of the crips.
But the Waorani are not just outsider the ways, but also each other.
Fif-four percent of their death came out of their death deaths from the death of their deate.
We could go to eight generations back to eight generations back to eight generations of a natural death of a natural death of a natural death death of a natural death of a natural death eight generations of a natural deat.
And then we continued to one guy that one man ever died from older dom died -- but at the same time he was going to be amazing a amazing amazing knowledge of the odddness knowledge of the oeroud.

To of these sensational things that can understand what to do is to learn something about this particular particular things about this particular become a black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldview, very interesting.
Would I ask you to call the great world's religions what would you say,
Christendom, islam, bulb bullam, ec.
One continent is always consider the consider of the attention that Africa had no religious religious belief had no religious belief had this thing.
Voodoo is simply the depth of this disilent religious ideas is the depths in the tragic diaspora while.
What voodoo is that interesting is the living between the lives, the living between the lives, and the does.
The lives, the spirit of the mind.
The mind can be involved from under the Great Water, answering the dance of the living in the spirit of the living time, so that at the time so that one scene that one scale point the god.
And that's why foodeastonis: You know to the Church and talk about God.
And thank you in the temple, and because you put it down the mind and because you put it through the mind, what can you happen to be happen?
This leads to a amazing tone: Foodom-volved collished single flooring college.
This tunately, the potential to influence the body to influence the body extreme extreme extreme extreme of extreme --
And all the sequence that I've ever been with the Kogi the Kogi is the most extraordinary from the north of Colombia.
And they are the Tairona civilization, which ever had ever the Cariban separate separate of Colombia have population in the naspire of the distribution of the desire.
They were involved back into a solessed volcanic mass that are above the coast-fladges.
In a blood continent to a blood continent was not just this popular was never resurved by the Spajates.
And they are getting them through ritual pries; it is the training to priester is pretty extremely extremely except.
The young acolites are going to their families when they are three or four or four are three or four or four.
They are sunit in a world of dare, in stone, in stones of foot letss, 18 years long.
Two periodes of nine years, conscious to months to both the nine months that they put into the shape.
Now they are in wise of the big mother.
These are all the time they have society values that are contentially involved in the content, which is only becoming the cosmic or ecologicically.
This inference is the inference of the day they are insimilar and for the first time in their life, if they are 18 and they are 18 points of the first bottomen's first boat at at that end up the first boat at the time of the scales of the scales of the scales of the scores of the shape, and the entire pries: The pries: The pries: The pries: The practices say:

And that's how beautiful it is to protect this is to protect itself the parents of the parents of brothers.
And we think about them are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And at this pointuitions is going to be very important.
If we think about inheems and landscape, and we often Rousin Rousase and the old factory of the edel, a idea that racistic is racistic in his simplicity.
Or we can do stories Thoreau and say that these folks closer than we do.

For both is a little space in the malaria moeras the Asmat or the ice, or in the ice. Desalnible. Desalniance in the poorin the poor, they have a traditional mystial mystic of the Earth, which is not the idea of the Earth, but at the idea of the Earth, but at a much more subtitil the Earth, the idea that the Earth, because the so. because of the Earth, human being.
What does it mean that mean? It means a little child from the Andes, which is grown with the belief that the mountain an Apu-mind that will have a fundamental different human violal different and a different relationship of that will have been a little child in a little child in a little child in Montana, is a little child with the idea that the mountain and a little child with the idea that the mountain's stone.
Or it the likely of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interestingly the metaphors that the defines between the individual and natural world.
I'm growing up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were crasses there were crashed.
That made me another ment, a different human beings of the Krogiulth, who believe that that those bosses that those bosses are the lives, and the Krommmanibal mine and the Kromm of the Hemel and the Krommmanibalth of the world rounds.
These minds are important to their Hamatsa-inved.
And if you start to the idea that these cultures can see, you start to get to get your understanding to get to some of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary realize that plant.
It's a picture that I have a photograph that I have a april Amazone nam.
This is ayahouse is the most powerful psychoactive repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahouse is so fascinating is not only the fascinating the poormacological potential to it, but how fascinating two sources. It's built out two sources.

If you only take the plant to it looks like a blue smoke through your blue is driving your consciousness.
The plant is going to be mixed with a coffee becomes like --
The plant squarter is powerful tryptamines, narrative because of brain serotonine, 5-methoxyltryltryltryltryptamine.
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they snut, that snut, that substance of different species that are also methoxyltryltryltryltryltryle,
That pood-your blazs, as a crazy, as from a getting blown by the barokages, to nature on a sea sea of electricity. This sscapes of realit; it creates defined from reality of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who did the psychedelic aian eran adiction of paddodos in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinate, because when the effect are involved in the fact, there is no one more home, there is no one more home, and experiencing their effect to experience. Tryptamines are not oral insides in the human darm-done in the human darmer of the human darmer oxidase.
They can only be oral emerging with something that the goline of songine of shape.
The fascinating is that the cator is that the cator in the limble smonoamine-suppressive shaptamine.

Now, the problem is that even the ones of those who are sympathics of insactly inseems and coloring curious and colors and coloring color, but reduced to a footnoot world, meaning our world, meaning our world, because the real world, the real world, through our world, through the real world, through our world, because the real world, the the problem is that even the real world, because the real world, it is that even the foot of the world --
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember 300 years to be his war or his technological innovations, but rather if the time the age that we are in it, and active participes or passive sultivate or apply destructive destructive destruction at the mass of biological and cultural diversity of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always been on a dance with new life opportunities.
Technology is also the problem is not the problem isn't the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians stopped not Sioux and bow their pile, when they put their pile, just as well, as much as that Americans stopped to be their horse and ways.
It's not change, or technology that integrity of the enos; it's power. It's power. It's power.
The wrong face of the government.
Where you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the lot of these cultures to disappearing these cultures to disappearing these cultures.
These are dynamic living on the followed by identified by identified forces that are provide to their appropriate possibilities.
Or this is about the huge of deforestation in the home of the Penan, a nomadic South Asian Asian entire angular generation in the forested and now reduced the forest, and now at the ancient generation in the wrong is of the reviverss, where you can see that the rivers, where you can see that the river, and prostitute the Soree, which is the rivers of Bore is going to be Chinese Suiding Chinese --

In the case of the Yanomami are the sick that are involved as a result of the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excess of a completely is being universal require, the destruction of the life of a people, destruction of a people, not only becomes not only in many areas even become part of a developmental strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to infrequires on the basic level of the basic level.
I have a young colleague 9,000 kilometers over the country from Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And as I came to Lhasa in Lhasa -- I began to the statistics where you hear about it.

The pain of Tibet can be intouch a confreeding of the freedom.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Wills we live in a gray world or we want to live a colorritical world of diversity world of diversity issue to the conversation?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that she strange that we direct an along amorf worldview that we can move to move the engine.
We would not only see the human imagination is going to be a melse, model, model, but also we would have been defined and forgotten that there are other options are other options of existence.
We can feel feel at the idea that our kind of pas about [150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our agriculture in which we had to replace, when the shaman was replaced by the shaman was replaced by the proshaman by the proshaman by the proshaman by specialization and we dish a decades.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history is not the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that will come the next millennia on our path.
If the intelligentles, the intelligence of people, the meaning of humans are asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we have to be the possibility to be discovering what we are going to be a completely species, which is everything in the work to work all the seems to be bloods. There are large moments of optimism.
This picture I have on the northern point of Baffin Island genomes, when I went to inside of the Island then you have to be yours.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Interge. In the 1950s, to focus on the 1950s, to focus in the settings.
The opa of Olayer to go to go.
The family for his life and he met his life and I met him all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Interinal were for the cold; they made out of the cold; they made of it.
The light ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice became the bones of fish in caribs.
Olayuks up to the past or the storm of the pool, or the storm that became the storm that became the storm that became the storm that became the storm that became the storm of the storm that became the storm that was not afraid for the polar to the poolnight or the storm that became the storm of the storm that was not afraid for the pile that became the storm of the storm that became the purpose of the storm that was not afraraishehead to the pidid
He went out to outside, he showed his bound-skin, and poopse and poeped his hand. When the poop began to woman, he started a limmet.
He brought a low-speeky on the sides of the sides.
And then it solide was solide there was a dog of it.
He met the dog and improvised a heart and improvised a heart of the dog and improvised a harnasts.
From the ribbs he made a bad one.
He looked in the neighborhood, and he disappears and disappears including poems.
And this is going to be around with nothing around with nothing about it, in many ways, state of the Intermination of the Intermination of the Intermination and all the inside of the world.
In april 1999 99 gave the Canadian government the Inuit the Intermines of a piece of a piece of country bigger than California and Texas saming new thue.
It's independent. They remed. They remember all the so.
It's a amazing example of how a native enough deaths to her people can bite.
And finally, I think it's clear to those who is clear, at least for whom to these hours of the world is reseemed to be geeasilion.
They are somebody's home country.
They are going to be able to the human imagination, which are going to go to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, are going to dreams of these children, are going to be part of a unconceived geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is going to be a little bit of the idea that politicians never achieved.
We think that post-tech -- we think that a polemic not convincing that stories can change the stories that can change the world, by we probably believe that we are probably the best way we probably have 35 million times a month, we are in 156 million times a month-sharing on 156 countries on the 156 countries on the world's cassure.
We make a felt felt to the enos; with our public, with our public, to our public places, in which the incredible, in which the incredibly exactly included by what he seeed to be the most important barrely of anthropology will go to be able to live in a diversity in a variety in variety in a way to live in a multiultiultiulticultiplticultual world
where all the evidence of all the seems can be seen to our seemed well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you with you about some question of that I have a book of the question that I have a book of the day.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
And I also try to explain some of a little bit of you who has you've been a little bit of you,
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To became exactly to be, the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is awful deaths to get the well-to-mailing shapes on the highest levels on the highest levels of individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good one, a cigual part of the human exist.
And the top of the freedom, freedom, to treat a point, to reach a higher well as a higher which is to reach a higher which is to be inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices love in that people have freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-well-well-well-well-well.
This is so divast so divast in our society that nobody would be deeply to be feling.
And in our lives is this dogma, this dogma urban
I'll give you some examples of our modern choices of our choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
Narrative to those 175 sizes are threats in my supermarket of supermarket, different extra-virgin olice pholil and twal-photograph.
And you can make your task and so that you can make your tiny between 175 species for you, nothing about it.
So that's the attention of my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can put your stareoset -- line your stareoset -- loudspeakers, cassettespeler, radio, surprise -- stronger.
And if you have one electronics that one electronics out of this attacks.
You can have seen six-and-half million different systems, with parts of those wins.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
And another example -- communication.
When I was young long, you could have all kinds of phones -- but only at Ma Bell.
You hurt it out. You couldn't do it.
That was the way that it had never gotten the advantage that it never go.
That time is forth.
And now, in the way we have a lot of different applied.
And in order to cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the m3-player, neushing and crack-break fuels and cracks.
And if you don't have seen this model in the wincle in the wincle in the wincket of his that is happening.
The sequence, people come to the wincle and assuming this question.
And you know how the answer to that question aw?
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do much too much to do it.
And in aspects of the life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, is this explosive increasingly shape.
Gealth care, it's in the United States is not the United States, and that you go to the doctor and you tell you what you have to doctor you tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and he said, "We can do A to do or we can do But,
A has this prevent has this forward and after it.
BBut, and then you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is you?"
And the doctor says, "A has this prevent and But, and naddless.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was me if you was do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision is that the sounds of destate -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the death, someone who are seeing decision to take decisions -- the patient. For reeps of recipment, in recipe of recipment,
Good destiled to the goal that nature goes, because the goal group, you can't buy them.
Why reclame of work, if we can't buy them to cope them?
Because they think that we think we are going to be the next morning, to ask that other maining average agenesis average.
Our identity, yet a practice of our exist, is now over-up, now amazing on choices, like you can see on these slides on this slides.
Our identity is that we lose our background.
We find ourselves out -- so we often just want.
Everybody morning, you have to be thinking what person you want to be thinking what person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the markay, the fact, the family.
There is a time that free everybody else there is automatically from that you would be as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible to children beginning.
The only reality was a couple of who's real, not when and what you do.
Now freedom everything to get to the opportunity.
I give you a couple of intelligent students, which I have done less housing.
They are not dommer or or lucer than in the early time.
No, they have the drug with choices.
"Sell I married or not? Are I married now?
Or will I wait? Am I first children, or a care?"
These are all suspendent questions.
They go through them to have an answer to have an answer, and they don't have their housing.
And they have the same life. These are important lifests.
And then we come to work. Carl just already all of that technology is to work every minute of every minute of every day's work, where in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, I love mead, where Wii it does.
I don't think I won't be true, because I want to keep that for myself.
But anyway, that we are massive choices of work in that we are incredibly asking us and then on and then we go and asking it and won't work, or not.
We can look at a footbaldu of our son on our son on the one hand, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and the light on shape.
And even if they all come out of the consider of that weadom with all kinds of these things -- "Am I ask this phone, "Am I responsidence to answer?
Are I response to this emailing gone? Are I write writing this letter?"
And even if the answer is the answer is we experience the football of our son on a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, materialistic things, life styl: life styl: life is a issue of choos;
And this is how the world looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a issue of choos;
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad it?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about is well-is what is bad to talk about it.
That huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings.
A very contradiction is that it first became more than freedomined than freedom.
And so many choices as much choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research to investment in volunteer planns.
A colleague of a colleague of Vanguard, and a guard, a major policy with about one million employees with about one million employees about 2,000 fings.
And they discovered that for every decades that for every decadeed the works, the part of the worked two percent of the works.
As fiftiple founds, there are 10 percent less employees than five than five founds. Why?
Because it at the next fifth is so hard to choose that people just researching the people to choice out to the next day, and that looks at the next day, and that look, and that on, and so on.
And from the exposed comes out,
That doesn't mean that people have been able to eat their pensionate, because they have not been enough money because they have been supposed to eat the choice was so hard to have it was a lot of shape.
And they had to go to the 5,000 dollars a year on their nos;
The worked was a couple to redubble to represent their own contribute to divide their own contribute to reach their own contributble.
And so many choices can be lost to work on the conversation
And I think the world out of it.
If it comes to the century to the century is to be very much like to the right choice creams, right?
You don't want to be excited with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second thing is that we have the bultimately if we dish the lost of our deaths and choose are less racks, eventually less ractioned than the case, if we had less options have less options of options are the result of the result than the case,
There are more of reasons for us to feel that are to fee.
One is that there is a choice, for example, for example, from tinet, it can look like the perfect.
You put you in a case, for that one other choice would have been better would have been better.
This is dried alternative alternative to you get from your choice.
And then it spots to the follow-follow-up the choice that you have made a good choice.
The more options are there to be more options of the things are to have the spike of uneasier that elected option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depend the value of things that we depend up the things we are comparing them on the same thing.
If you can invent many alternatives you can invent many alternatives of all the alternatives that you detect the alternatives that you deted.
That makes you have less tappearing with the alternative that you have chosen you've got to have cod.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is a single on vasider the Hamptons.
They have a throw two-and-one.
They are on a beautiful strand. Stralend weather. No human in sight.
Don't be able to do it? "To that man, "It's carried to be gusts.
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city out.
I could go to the door, I could do my car for the door."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was a great idea that he crives every day a great parking place for a great parking place place for a great parking place for a great parking place for a great parking place that he was missing on there.
And the stitutioncost of the enticost of the enticost of our choice, even if we make an amazing choice.
The more possibilities are possibilities to be more accountable alternatives.
And those presenting us as a substitutial costs.
One of an example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to go away.
One is that you can do with every choice other choice other choice.
And all that other has been so attractions that are involved option the cooperiod.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in my square to a new job.
I turn almost play to be almost spirit always spirit to be a little bit of it.
And the bought was one kind of stuff, and that bought you couldn't be the past; it doesn't have the sat incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were bought enough and often enough you were going to be enough and often enough enough it to.
And after years I went to the wincle for a news.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff, this is my meas."
And the winclear said, "Welt you smart, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Would you have you walk whether a rhy? Would you be stone?
Would you have a bound?
Wilt you something called a little bit of pipes, or flink out, and so he went out and go through it.
I was spoke on it. And after a while, I said, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea what bounds was that and so I have a hour for a long hours all the possible bits of the potential breeding on the potential bones
And it turns out to be a cell eventually explored with a check of the breek.
I had better than I had better than that I could do it better as that possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To do this on myself, I wrote this on myself, I wrote a book of a book of a book on a book on a book on a book on the body? To I wrote this on myself.
The reason I feel better with all of that choice, with all of those choice, was that I began to expect of a good speeds.
I started without any expectation, because I just just just one kind of stuff.
And then turned out there there was different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
And what I was bought to be good -- but not perfect.
And so I recommend my bounced with my expectations, and that asked me teleging.
The more possibilities people have to have more possibilities they coosting about the deservices of that possibilities.
And that means people are less tacked with results, even if the good results, even though the good results.
Marketings people know this.
Because in that case, you didn't know where I'm talking about that I'm talking about now.
And in the really is about it.
Everything was worse when everything was was worse.
Because when everything was worse when everything was worse to have a lot of surprised experience.
In our modern society as well as a well as a well civil civil as perfection, but the best thing we can ever reach is that something is so good when we were expected to be as well.
Nonce we are resurprise because our expectations, my expectations, are high.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you, and you all have come -- the secret of happiness.
I want to be here -- a car biographical element, I am with a woman element, I am with a woman who is really fantastic.
I won't asked her with less tacks.
But with less enought to be good sides.
And finally, when you get a bad on the stuff is a bad set of the things like there is only one kind of presides -- you can ask your intension.
The answer is that case, in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you haven't choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available and you buy it turns out to fall, who's responsible?
The answer is just as simple. It's just like that. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different bounces you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decided to take people decided as that are decisions are good to be well-up telegated over their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger time.
A factor -- not the one of the enia, but it's a significant factor at this explosive increasingly of depression and self-suicient experiences are of their high expectances are of their high expectations.
And when they try to explain that teleurposed to explain themselves.
So the nettoresulat is that we have talked about it, but our bad of them are going to feel out of it.
A quick a collaborate together.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be away.
But that's not not it.
It doesn't have two-doubt that can choose better than not choose to be more choice and not automatically that more choice is more choice is more choice is more than you can choice more and more more choice is more choice is more choice that is more choice is more choice.
There's a magical flows on choice. Well I don't know.
But I know that we have for long before we have for long long before we are already for us well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best thing to do about it.
The choices of industrialized countries comes out of material overs from material overlow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about where the problem is not so much choice is that there is too much choice is too few choice.
So the paradox that I spoke to the moderne, so the moderne, which is what the moderne, which is going to be the moderne, which is going to be a lot of modern, which is that I speak for the moderne, which is going to be a lot of moderne, which is what I speaks to the modern for moderne, which is that I sp
That's frustrers, and this: Steve Levitt is that you have yesterday told you that expensive and stallering your child shape. Sung of your money. Sung money.
I tell you about this dure, including choices -- they don't help now, they don't help up to the shame.
They make us less value.
If a part of what people in our society is to make all those choices to make all those choices of operating for people in the way that people have to go on and define the life of that people are going to go on to forward.
And we have to go on on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversion of what the map of well-shape, and that comes through the choices that we are with our crashed of the crashes that we are with us with us.
And finally, if you are going to be the image story -- you know, you are a humans as a developed of the fish -- "Ach, what fish is there now?
None is possible in a fish compos."
A scrale example, a shortile global image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it, the time I understood that I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, in fact, this is to the hand: If you get the fish crossing to create possibilities, you haven't lamming.
If you have the fish crazy to create possibilities to create possibilities of the tacks.
It leads to more lose and less tackage-peaceked.
Everyone has a fish of a fish of invition.
This is free certainly certainly -- possible for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the security of a figure out of a figure out of a figure out of a figure out and displayers, require, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
