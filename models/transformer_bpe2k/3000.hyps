Fore years ago this two dia's two million years to get the photograpes that the last last last million years in the U.S.
But this is the hundreds of this specific problem because the decar of the heath,
The oile of the North of the North is in the climate of our heart of us system.
It was a set of the winter and crimpt in the winter of the som.
And the next dia that I can see a version of what the version of what the last 25 years is happened to see the last 25 years is happens.
The performanentists is a little bit in the him.
You see, you see, it from the hundreds of the hundreds of the shabbriddge.
That's the good's sos of the winter.
And the crimpt in the som.
The cromber, the perforttook or years or years or years or years or years or blood, that from the boddy's both of the both of the both of the botttttook the both of the boddys.
In 25 years is the of this back of this is the good.
And that's a problem because the woman and front and front the North of a sopt and a big felt of a big big felt and foot that was a lot of the death, when the decar or devicromber, by a mean in member.
As with the totowards of the towards of the atmospited in the atmospition, that could be a bigious point.
In some some of a sodiepmber, in Alask of the water.
At the last winter Profesor Katey Walter of Alask of Alask of Alask with a shaving a team to a set of Alask of All
And no! They is OK. And the question is going to be that will be that will be able to be that.
A reason for the good, that this humbers of the mber. Gencountry of the ornovel of the ornovel of the ornoves.
This is a smell purnatrids.
The water's water's hhhhor grow it.
This is the Kanglusual astrather in South Gureenend.
If you want to know how the seven the seven of the country because it was the country.
These stroming neighbor.
At the other care of the planet of the South cent, the biggest biggest massion on on the biggest of the biggest massion.
As the maortemed scientists that the whole center that the whole center of the whole six balancy and balance of the whole salant.
Meer is the goom is the past of the South of the South of the felt of the felt water.
The whole whole continue for sown, the sown, like Genenend.
In the Himalaya, the two years ago, and making the two years ago, there are now now now now a few years ago, which was a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's connected of the help of his hundreds of that felt of that smalls.
In the Andes, this glester is this good-hind water.
There are more stroces.
But when they were foodddomined the hunkes it was the hater water.
In California was a version of 40 percent of 40 percent in the equickkku.
It is really really in the waterreserireserireserirefireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireserireseriireserirevireseriii.
And if you could be the expresed the expredictell.
These se se se has been been to a lot of homic stic strong of sandands.
And the course of course about the whole world is a lot of non-fount and never seen and never never squate.
For more more in the last last 30 years in the last last last 75 years.
This pattern is flulucks.
And if you look at the both conteacher conteacher of a little bit of what happening here here is happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million years, we had 70 million years.
25 and foot and ton the oceans, Kans, Kevily Ockille Ocket of the Stile of America, and every time and every time and every six of India, and every six of Indian an artttane of Indian in the oceanton the ocean in the oceance of oceance of oceance of oceance of oceance of the oceant, and and and and the ocean
The only one one of the opportunity of the shaming of the Earth of the fluding of 20 percent of the photograps, it's the fluccropphic strong of photograph of pposed to purposed the last percent of photttable.
Or is a problem and stead of the all, the all.
The United States is one of the two biggest of the two biggest of China.
And there was a lot of more explained to build a lot of cools and building to build build it.
But we see a member.
These are the steaks, the book of the bigger was the bigger of the last years and where where growth of the last years in the last years.
There's a political strong of political strong in country.
The steaks, and ololds industry -- and then then 250 million dollars of a single of the cool of the crocknew promomots of a cross of models and shaving a cross of the cells of a cross of a pusual promove years.
And that example me to something about something about something to something about something about something about something to something about something about something about something about something about that.
Right, the shavior me me me me in Tennessee, about four billion billion billion shaps of four billion diseced --
You have the news that you can see the news that you see it it it looks
This is the one of the largest of the mainclustrate of America.
This happened the Kerst.
One of the additions of the convertentions of the Kerst Kerst was the Kerst Kerst was ded.
Fideo: "Well, Frosty is a crosty is a shably shably shaks.
He is a fluence in America, and he took in America, and he told that economy for that economy for our economy grows.
Frosty the stead of the cools of the hundred day.
He was a making and cattil and cattt."
Here's a big big of the step of the steenknew in West Viririrds.
The largest most most of the country is the country of Massey Co.
Fideo: Don't Blanguguguage and far the Let me me me foot Gore, Harry Pelell Harry Revile Harry Revily Pelell they don't know about it.
Al Gor: So has the Alliance for Klilives for Klignes for two campagnes on the too.
This is a little bit of a shave.
And I see the BCOLoily, we see the cliving changetation as a serious serious of our saw for our own own own expect our own own own of our own own own chose for our saw of our own work.
That's why the reason the reason is the important, is to a gigantantation of the ligent of the living and the living and the living and the lives.
Fevily is not squokly not shave.
Because it was that the scale -- and it's -- and the rurun of the rurun of the rurun of the run --
So, you don't know about free about climate change.
Let that not to refar us to us.
Fideo: Atecur: Scho: Schoo: Schoo:
So we see a little bit of this hypermodern of this hypercentrale.
Fantast! The machines that is to make what lay is fluc.
But that is the happy of scenkes technology.
Our flots the fact that the fact of the farch of the most important important of the warming of the photograph, the changing of the bottttook that you see see that that you see see that you see see what you see that you see see what you see see see that that you see see see what you see see that that that you
And if you know, this is the scree of the wrong technology of the day.
Al Gor: Einventually the positive photography and that was to our economic and that was on the building of the building of national national regative.
Fideo: Em: Even America wrong -- the economy, the economy, the economy, the clivishing clivish.
The ross the so-purposed of the depensix photographs of purposed and shamber, and shamported and shambers of the ross of the rockile and foot of the ross of the ross of the ropphim.
But now there's a shaf, new opportunity to this is to this from this is to this this is a so.
Fort, America of 100 percent of 100 percent of the couple of years.
And a plan to get America to get the work on the work that we get a plan that us and the warming of the photograph of the boddy.
And intially a shavior to be able to be able to use our problems on our problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of problems to make our problems to make problems to make our problems of the problems of the problems of it.
Reventually America.
Al Gor: And the last last strone.
Fideo: And it is going to be America to America to make energy and energy energy
A of the posed of the end of the end of our indepension, they were fluding to our planet, and our planet, and our planet, and our planet.
Man: Han: Here's the future. Wind, a new new system.
Man 2: No we invests to create a briddge to create create creatures.
Stem: Repower America. Repod to realized to realized to realized to real.
Al Gore: There is a oud African African intention that says, "If you want to tell you you you you want to know it.
If you want to go to go to make it.
We need to go to go and food.
Thank you very much.
Fore years years I was a introduction about the LHHC at TED.
And I was a far to come to come up with a couple of how machine machine that machine that machine machine
So here is a lot of the gene: the Let that they didn't know the LHere's the biggest of the largest scientific experiment.
And the toman to 60 million hundreds that were depensider than a billion the universe of the universe that the universe to 60 million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million
Enorm ambitiion,
This is the machine Genenvironment.
We took ook the photographs Bangs Bangs in detectors and this detectors -- the ATAs -- it was the AAAAs -- 44, 4, 4, 4, 22 meter in 22 meter in 22 meter 22 meter of the dead.
Spectacular picture of ATATATATATake in the scale.
And then then the 10 seped in the first time we were the first machine for the first thing to the first first machine for the first machine for the first food.
This picture was the photograph by ATLAS.
And that are the fact of a fluming of the controlllam.
It's a picture of the first cross the first cessaph that helped the LHHere's the Let with a little bit of the Lk of the Lak of the LCCwhere the deces of the decluc.
And then we had the photograph on 10 September, which we were the machine that the machine is a huge of the machine is a huge of the machine is the machine is the machine is the machine is the machine that the machine is the photograppphotograpposed when we were the machine that we were the machine that we were the machine that the mach
I don't know if this biggest future ture ture -- somebody when somebody to Google and saw that the interact that the interinteract that the interinteract that the Interterrids.
And that means we have a culture as a culture as a scientific photograph and they have to make a culture of a scientific photo.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what had to make this gold.
And that they were 13 thousands were recently when the machine when the machine on the machine on works.
The ingingings of you will say, "Niiet that are going to make little bit of little little bit of small."
They can do that because they can be superidentil temperaturs.
So on 27, the last graphs, the maybe the girring of the sterry, that strated.
In a of the connected between the needs of the nets of the LHC, a constructife constructitift.
And then the so-warmber, and was inventual focus to 13 thousands that foot 13 years ago.
This was the result.
This is a posed of the foot of the realized that magnets more than 20 and they were about 20 center and they were about center center and they were about center center and they were to be about center and they had to be the maggnets of centon the magggnets of the maggggnews.
We were fluding about 50 magned.
We had to move them from the last so.
We all all when they all all of the part.
And they were back on on we.
Eind the Let the LHC to be intace the Let
We will go to go to make it and we were foottune or you can see the way that we can go to go to the building what the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Nut, of course, that incclucckes the debly of science of science of science is easy to work.
I think it's so hard that that that that we had to be able to be that we remother than the where the where the LHC.
I was the last words on the last science Humphy Humphy Davy, and I was the decacaused the des of the moves, they were the movation of his Micha's Micharline was the Micharth of Michar, "Na's the human bes of the human human human human bes of the human human human bes of the human human human bes that that examples of our our extraore that that that that that that that that expecious exists of the last last last last explainccross the the the only that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that was a little bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit of the last last last last last last last last
Thank you very mut!
I would would start to go to go to go back to go back to look at kids to higher in the blows.
And then you know, you can move to move them and they were frow and behom, you know, the let of the let and the both of the both of space and of the other relations.
Rutelimmediature is a lot of the world because with the world of the world to understand our hears.
If a inform inquicirespirespirespired of physical interaction with my advision -- with my advision of the devils my medical of Kanalii -- I started to asked what we started to do -- what we could see what a lot of the computer of the explaincluence that that we could be a kind of a lot of the pult of the explaincction, and we can can make a lot of a lot of the pulation of the kind of the ping of a a a a a a a a crottttttttttooltools of of of of of the pical ical ical iny of the pultify of the way that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that ininy beginning that that that that that that that that that that that that
and ordence we want to want to do you you want to do it.
These question that we decise that we decided to be a answer and of Siftables.
Kort invented is a Siftttababout,
They can be able to the hand they can be able to make them and they can movement and they can movement and they can make a scree and they can make a little act.
The ckile is the physical clubbriddy, as bad they can be decar to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be debbrip in the physical brip of the physical crip is the frip of the frip is the ff of the physical physical
Boventually Siftabable, a new example of a new ecosystem for the way of chosystem of chosystem inform inform of choosystem of chosystem inform inform of example of example of the pultable.
And that that this hult of physical physical different, and they have been foot of their movement and and then they were moved, and they are moved, and other other interactly new interactly and interactly interactly the way that we were all all all the way of their own pultiffree.
I will start with a few of a simple of example of example of example of example of examps.
This Siftttababort, and they took to tell a little bit of climate and other shaving and other other shaving and other other shaving and other shapes that is that seet.
These interaction of each others are consciout.
Indiand then they will be able to each other, they will be interessive to each other.
And if they can be able to make this pacross them and what they can see it it also also also a lot of so-way.
And then they move them and helling.
We realized that one of the interaction that one of the interaction of these interaction, the Interterridge of the call, and as it was a little bit of smallenvironmental fluc.
In this example of Siftababout, and I can use them and I can use them to use them small, where they use them to make them to make them up to make them them to make them them to make them to use them to use them to go and they can make them to make them to make them to make them to use them to use them to make them to use them to make them up a food.
If we have to read the way we go back to go back back to what we go back back to go back to the back.
There are some of a cappears of the hundreds of the hundreds of the photttable to make the movity and the movity to make the move things that we want to see the result of the middle of the midddle of the middle of the midddle of the middddle of the proted.
And this ton -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple program by a simple program.
And here we see a frible that a cruise of Scrabbrible and Bognize.
The principle is that you want to get a way a little bit of Sifle-Siftable, and then the words and the words in a words in a words in a work.
Na about seconds that is very seconds of the scue of fluding a new serions of purpotention of motions.
Thank you.
These are some of explained to excluccy Lab, and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm going to get them to get them to get a video and a video of video o o and a video of the Medidia fluence of the Media fababout.
They were works.
And one of the most interesting things that that moving this chance is that people are not instructions of these structions of these purs.
All what you have to say "Mooo."
And here are some other people on the tests.
That's our ness young battta tex,
And that he seeed that he took the Siftababout.
And then it was only blows.
Here is a interaction cross the interaction,
We want to make a platform for the line of tappearing developing developing developing to developing a shaps.
This is Felix that demonths
He can ckarch in the scape of the scape Siftttook that carch of the tools of the tool.
Here he was the shaving the shave.
Fideo: The son on it.
David Merrrac: Here he has a tracky in the scape.
Fideo: The oranimagine.
God shaving ! Yeah! Yeah!
Do the scue of Siftabababout, and the night and the ckarart of each others -- Video: Wil: Wo: Wo: Wo!
DMM: and so so his own story.
Video: HHere !
DM: The story is a story with a mother.
and he took how it was how it to read it.
Fideo: The cket foods.
DM: The last example that I think that is going to be a synthess, and Is that we have been developed to developed the experienced that we have been been been able to be a shaping of the universe of the connect of the depension.
Everybody has been different experiency to be able to be able to use your choose you can use use your used to use use use your caes.
These happy can be invented in Siftabable, so you can be the patterns that you can be the patterns of the patterns of the patterns of the patterns can be the patterns can be the pattern.
You see a sound in the patterrrunning of a lege Siftttabable, a controll, and moving the effects of the moves.
They are going to be a sounded to be a couple and climate by copportunity to be a cluces.
And then the already effects like tempo and then that will be able to be able to be able to the whole patterns of the whole patterns of the whole patterns of the whole patterns of the whole patterns of the whole patterns of the whole patterterns of the whole patterterters.
Let's look at look at it.
Fideo: D: We started inking with a lead of the two in Siftables, to a first pattern, to a extra extra extra phia extra phim of extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extroup of extroup of extra ex
Now, I was the basic lline the basic lly.
Fideo: D: D: Wifoot what I mean.
Fideo: And so so copportunity I can ple the purms, so I can be the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the fuel of the film.
Fideo: D: I can be very very very fluence by the chance of the temps of the tempo blow.
Fideo: D: A: Accrople I meter to what expression.
Fideo: And I can make it it can be patterrrate the hight.
I don't know that that everything that we can plane the imvise and provision, it can make a long long long and making a little bit of making it.
Moe of the dimmmmess, the volume Sifttook Sifttttook to look at the botttttook at the volume to look at the volume of the volume of the volume to look at the volume of the volume to look at the bottttabout.
Thank you.
And if you can see my passize my passix computer in the new people's interfaces that are interfaces are consisisted to the way our brain the brain in the brain and botttes.
And I had to have one new that you one needs to be a new new ellives and climate with some of a samounds that we have to developing the developing and in the developing of the developing and his own chall.
And the real real real that I want to talk about this bign to a very new generation to a new generation for the interacterms of the interacterms with the information that we want to our our own provivious expect to our world that we wanted to do the world in the world.
I thank you know, you know,
I look at the way to tell you to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to you.
I'm wrote it.
But, I was my work, but also a lot of things that we were more than that we seet.
My whole country, I think of scree and I think that that will not think that that will be change.
And I think something expect something express something that happened in my life and fridding, and fococus to my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work in the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of life.
The began to the book that I have a book of a measire, "Everysted Botttttook "Ever, which was in the world to my working about the world and international international international intersent to my work.
And the flucy that people who have to be the tembers and always dembers.
What's the food!
And people go to me to me and questions and you don't know that you don't know that you don't know that that you can't be able to evene?
And you don't know that you know you know, you know, you know, you know, but never fluence that that never will never be a book more people for warm that people will never be able to be able to be a book of the warm that people will never be able to warm that people will never be be able to hight?
You don't know you don't know that that you don't know you know it.
Erunnight, you know you know you know you know
Now, that would be very very very very very explained that I was a little bit -- I was a til years ago, when I was a til I was -- if I wanted to tell the well.
Moeople said, "By you don't know that you know, you never get success?
Do you don't know that you know, that you know, that you know, that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of of it.
And you don't know that you know that you know that that that there are a lot of the way that there was something that that you can see that you can see that you get to get your both with your biginal bit?"
Is in that tunat.
In the ororder to be to be on that this question, "Yea."
Ja, I am a bigger that enough to be able to be able to be able to make things that enought things that enough to be able to make things that enough
All time
But I'm also also also a lot of other things are not not not know that that that all of all of all of all of everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for all of the other things that that are not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not know that that that we want.
For example of example and other other other other things.
But what is the extraored question, I member, where the last time that ance of the last time to be the last time to be the last time to be the last time to be the last last time of the last time.
Is the ration?
Is the logical that somebody was a blogical that is to their work for their work for their work for their own forward?
What is so explaination to creative our invative to make us to make the effects of the effects of other other species of different different spections of different spections that happens.
No, I could be my father. He was cross the copy of them, and I can't remember that he could be a year he was not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever a lot of that was not not a bigious years ago.
So "Yohn, how it's how it's the chemieblow?"
No, not about about about about about shad.
Or father to be a fartil artists have the century of the century of stuff for stuffff, and foot of stuffff,
Schose that have a kind of repptil of repptic remetation of repptil
No only only explained in other creative people have to be remetation of the remetation of instabable.
Consix but to the griddge of the most magine of the most magine of the 20th century.
For felt young ng foot by their own future.
And even even degenes that not the same way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be move their hundreds to be the moord to be move their high the moders,
In the last interview for his food was said "Me: "Me: "Me: "Me: "Mee: "Meeeven."
That's nogal what to say about you know about you know,
But of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of that we don't look at more opportun.
We all heard the first thing and have heard the salls and have the cells of the too.
The brain the brain is that creativity is that creativity is to remean to read with labious and that is to exists to exists to make it to explaint.
And so I want to know everything that you can see with that life with that living that living ving ving that living ving ving ving ving ving that living to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the way that living ving ving ving ving that living ving ving ving ving ving ving ving ving ving ving it.
Finds you know that you know that you know,
Because I think about fluence about fise I don't know the helped that it doesn't have a little bit of chood.
I think it's the wearkly infrows.
And then then then it seart.
I would not like to see that this century is so far as good.
We can creative a lot of the pacter and many of the sport to read it.
I know that that it was that the must be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the bigged to the bad bad bad bad bad big.
See the fluding in my carddone in my cards.
Ga but I was a set me me me me a little bit of years.
I can make a four decentura lot of making work.
And I think that it's going to be everything that is that one of the expensix consiside. And then the work that is that explained that that is just just just a book ook that that happened by the connect of the work.
We are with friends of friends I can see it it can be making the making making the biggest successful successful successful successful successful successful posed to friends
Jemig, what a idee!
If you know that you know what you know you know for your chooo-hind to the during of the dark.
So I don't want to not not want to do that.
I wood, I love me to be worked with the work of it.
The question question "Harar."
Now, I think I think that I think that I can only the concusion I can just just just just by the crow of cross the cently in the process of the process in the process of involved in the conside.
I have to see the scree of the scree and climate and fluence and fococcurity and climate my felt to understand the reactance for the reactactly the reactation of the reactable to my fluence and ffar the reactable.
I have the last years, so so so so we need to do that to do that to do that to do it.
I'm in the history is in the history and deeps and deeps in other other people, or or maybe a way or maybe a way way to help people have have to help the emove people to help the emotional complication of creative the equative of creative percent of creative people have to help the equion.
My set me has been building up up to the Grieved and Rom.
Let me it is a long and inventually invent.
In the time of the old Grieved and Romenened that people don't believed that people was not creativity was not creativity was not creativity of the same hendge.
My belieff that creativity was a government of a reversion, that that was a responsix to the fun and and once of the form and once of the poses.
The Grunning of creativity and of creativity and of creativity "demonths "
Our Socrates that he had a demon that he had to him him him that they had to make him that they had to make it to make it to make it it to the flurunning that he had to the way that he had to make it to the way that he had to make it it to make it it it to make it it it to the words he had to make them in the flummmmmmm
The Romened had a spectout.
And they were to make them to be a lot of creative the creative of "
The graple is that the Roms with a geney not a genttttttabout.
In their beautiful was a geney of magical didisead, that equired of the purs of the art.
A little bit like Do o o o felt.
And if the artists was working on the gent of genet.
Our squot he work.
Brilliant! That's exactly where I was the first time I was about the first psychological psychological cise of your work.
Iethy a wrong of works.
The artive was so flucction of genttism.
And if you know, if you know, I was not not all the easy of the event.
Iethy a shaviously that a shaving your hold.
And then you know that foot is not only that not only only to you,
Iethy a nogal that you know, you know,
Lange time is that that we were the Westians had creativity was a bigged.
And then the Renaissansansansansansansansansansansansanaissanaissansansanaissanaissansansanssansansansansansansanassanaissed the Renaissanaisssssanaisssssssana
There was a new ideas, the middle idea: the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle and all all of the both and all all the middle of the middle of mysters.
Go space for mystic fart of the government of the government.
That was the beginning of the rations.
Moo-believed that creativity of indiviviviles.
And for the first time in the history was about about artisted that they were says, they were not not a genet.
I have to say that I have to say a big food.
And one person on one person on on the couple of the explain that he was the way that he was the brain the way of the century, the century, the century of the century of the expect of the explainable to explain -- it's a lot of human human human human bebeauth, for the human human human human human beauths for the human human human human beaudidid.
Also, you think the sof, the son on on the shaps.
Every's expredict to gigantation and there are expredicted and there are expredicted to expredictation of exprepredictation of exprestature out of exprepredict that expredictions.
And I think this pressive of the last 500 years artists has been been sot to make it it it to make a lot of the last 500 years art.
If that if that is that I think it's the question, "What is "What do is "What do is "What do is the question.
Cunccle we do this thing thing eles?
Cunccy we go back to a rather beginning of the relationship between the creative of the creative myster?
Maybe not not not
Because we can make 500 years ago, 500 years ago to make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of the center center center cent.
And then, you know, there are in the audience that people who were felt about the scientific felt that felt of what the idea that food-fount of the work of the work of inspirctions.
It doesn't seems me you all all of you know that you get it to get it.
And I think it was me me me me me me me me me me me
Why no?
Why would we could not move that mov?
The climate of hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Is a that eventually really really create to create a little bit of the face -- -- -- -- -- -- that it was not always creative percent -- that it doesn't always always always always always always always always ded.
And that some of the bigger inally felt of a bigger expresent
I have a long gartil American andied Ruth Statters,
They were dik in the newtil Here was very very very free they did.
They told me me about her yourrself on the platttold Viriria.
Some when they were on the flove that was the works on the sod-died up a died of the country.
It was so felt that there was a big gololf came out of clulucks.
And so I was a fololff of the country to her move her mother.
They felt the grount her foot her foot to frow her fluding her flowing her her flow: the fart of her her flow:
They running to look at the high-higher and they mother and they move them and they move and move paper and they can see the paks.
When the and, the shaving her holds was that her her her her her her her her her moves.
Some was not not not to be enough enough to be enough.
Dan running and running and running it doesn't not not not the human.
And in the shaps of the diset of her heart her heart -- in her farch -- in her her words -- in her other did.
Our choice were a lot of -- this is the beautiful of the story of the story that they were the story that they were the posed of the poses.
And then they was in huge in house and papier, and paper the did, and foot her her her died her did.
Jue that had to get a pottile of paks.
And with her other hand, so told me me me me me to the sody-shaped up from the clud.
They payed the bigger of his strong and then it back back back in her bottttook it it was the opportunity
In that caused to be the dised of the shaps of the paper in the big, but in the bombs of the wome.
And then I heard -- what I thought -- what happened to creative my creative percent of creative percent of creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent percent of the creative percent of the creative percent of the creative percent
So o works my creative percent not a mem!
I am a much.
But even even in that dayed a dayed experiency experiency had a lot of experiency ses.
You will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a parttttern that you can make your heart.
What is that we make it to make a front of far?
How can we use it to use that we can be working to be work?
And I think that good for us for us for us to us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us to us for us for us for us to us for us to us for us for us to us.
The best contemporaded to be example that I can think is a flucks.
A few years ago, I was the book the time to him him for a time.
We had this to this problem.
To is a big big of his life of his life of his life of his life of the heart of the heart of all the making of all all of all all of all the making of all the shappultive that creative to get hipultive him in the devultips.
My the years was to tell what the years to tell what was to tell what was the years
And in Lo's day he changed Anycross the process.
And as he heard that he heard the heard of a meldiodiodiodiodiodiodid.
The shaps of shaps like inspiration that is a lot of the briddomens.
It was a beautiful and he wanted to fasked the fasked it was a fasked the fasked and he wanted to make the fasked the fasthess.
But that didn't know that that that was not going to be not going to be not going to be not to be able to be it.
He had not a papion, not ppetes, not a paper in a so.
And the far of the spance of heart of heart the melessasays, "I took the melectricks, it turns out of the century of the century of the mout.
I'm not good enough to not not not not not not not very good enough.
He didn't cked at the panion, but he took that whole thing to get something something something new process and dested to make something new --
He keep homs to the luluding and said, "Sorry "Sorry not see that I don't see it it it was not to see it it it it higher it it it was not see it it it higher and he says, "Sorry and he says, "S
"Den't really really really really really now, now, now, no?
If you really want to be that this love you have to be foot that you have to be able to be time to be time to be able to be time you have to be able to be able to be a little bit of it.
And not, not, you can see somebody else fall.
Good's neighborn Cohen." And that was a little bit of love ve ve percent of course well.
And the work is the same thing with the most of the biginal bital connect of the buntunch of the decar with the decar with the decar
But the sware spance that creative the creative and it was a hightor when he was a decaused of geniion.
The gence of the shaving on the humans and left the cell.
To realized that there was not read to be a reason was to go through the hundreds of hundreds of it.
It could also a wonderful biarart of a kind of consiversation between To and the mazing of To that not not even even even even even even even even though that was not not like to To was not to To was not not not not to To squar
And that is my way my way of word.
I have a profluct of happhim of happhim.
I was the middle in the scree of Eaxtttoo.
I was a shaving in the animppose in the another.
You don't want to work on that that you don't want to be able to fluence that it a little bit of the book book the book book book
No bbig, they really really really really really really bigious bridge.
I wanted to do it the whole project of them to do it up to do it it to do it it to do it the whole project of them to do it it was going to do it was going to do it.
And then I rememe to be to his geney that geney and I decided to be a point to way.
I wended me me me to my manucrip and rip of the cridge of the cridge of the cridge of the cridddge of the criddge of the cridddge of the criddge cri
And I said to say that if we know know that if we know that if we know that if I don't know that if you know, it's not only that that if it's not only not only by not only because of the mess.
You can see that there is that I have to know that I have to do me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me
And I can't know that that ft.
And if you know that the beautiful you have to do you have to do you do it.
She says you don't don't don't you don't don't know you don't know you don't you.
I write just that that is not not a simple of work.

June Cohen: Ollet
You know, I have to have the way about a few of these projects of these projects of this projects, and what that can make the discovered of genet, and the discovered of gences of genet.
We had been been a new point of the biology point of the fun of the exitalized to make that chose we can make that the new fluding of the design of the design of the design and synthetise and synthetil the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the ocean an new foods.
So we have to make the big questions to be able to explained the big question.
"What is something that living a lot of bioos have to understand what a lot of different niverses.
We have different agenions of different agenious componies to improduce compones.
We are the most most of the expect of the changes.
And then we have the human genessasaw the human sequence, the ano-world of the fun of the computer of the computer.
Now, we can ask ask the question, we can make our life can we can make our life life can create this fold?
This is the climate of a little bit of a little bit of a small-genitalium, with the small, with the small, for a kind of a sultivuly of the shaviorium.
And we have to look at a night or we can see a night of ness.
We can be in the order of hundred and sundred of the 500 or so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so we can be a hundreamamount of the ororororororororororororororor
But if we look at the metabolc choickly relative to the relationship with the once of the one.
Goof -- this is a simple simple of it.
But when we look at all the geney that we can see a lot of a little bit of cross the cell cross the cle cle celels.
We had to explort that the environments was to be this chromospited this chromospited to the componies that we could be able to the most of the most of the most of the most questions of the most questions can ask the most question of the most questions can be expect the most of the most expect of the most of the most exactly coup
And so we started to asking with question, "Cuncromospit?"
Staking the chemy that very very moleculture that we never have never to make that that we never have never set it never shaped to make it to make it it to make a little moleculture that we never have never never to make this big moleculture that we never have never have to make a big molecular of the chemememy that we never have never never have never never never never never never make this
And if we can do that do, a chromosed "Wort."
A chromosed to tried to chemrow a little bit of chemical intic invents material.
So, the exphotograpo of the digitalized of life is on exponential diponential disotial did.
Our mothers to fross the genetical cost cost of love love shaps -- but it's making gentttom.
And our last point to this picture on this exponential stonential stradiseet.
We are more than 15 years ago,
There were a couple of expect inside with a bio-hthic future future of the first experiment.
But the black that the synns of DNA very movil.
There are timbers of machines in the world that little bit of DNA mamaking about 50 years, and it's a definding -- and it's a deservation of the deal process, so how to be a lot of the way of the stuff of the way of the way of the stuff of the stuff of the world.
So we had to make a new medict of the tunch of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all the corrigger of all of all of all all of all of all of all of all of all all of all all of all of all of all of all of all all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all the
And this was our first poging, to start with the fun of the fun of the genoom of the genectra Phi Phi Phi 17.
That's a little bit of four bacteria four bacteria
We had the stuff of choks, the foot of the flucks.
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 years ago.
The spanness of beginning when we incceemical stic or in the bacteria and the bacteria and the genetced the genetcs, and and so that we are all all of the genetces.
The virtual works were sings out of the cells, they were back to go back back back to the Eawhether the Ecoco.
I was a long gartil in the ololiestry, and I said that they had to model that model but they model to make that model to make them to make them model of the model of the ololence.
They law more than you love lot.
And why we think this situation is what this situation is that in the software are own hard-system system.
But we wanted to wanted to make something grow a lot of grows.
We want to build the flucromosed to build mosoom mosoom
That's more than 50,000 years ago.
And so we were to build them to build them in cassetttor of virussion, so we could the cassettttttook the cassecttttttttttor
And to understand what the done components of a living ving ving a liliving of living a living ving ving ving the couple of a living couple of living the cout.
The design is crucial crucial information in the computer of information in the computer of information information in the computer information information is very exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly information in the computer of information information in the computer of information information in the computer of information in the computer information of information in the computer
And then we were the first gene that was the same sham in 19995 was the food-foot of the foot of a fard.
And then we could be resequences we could requences the order of front that was not used to use the way.
Our part of the design is the design of study and stuff that 50 years, and with all the other stuffs of the other stuffs of the other other of all of all of all of all of all of the way to make them and we can make them and we can make them to make them and we can make them and we can make them and we can make them and we can use them and and they can make them and we can use
We have a design in the fact of them in the nature of a connectitives.
Maybe you have to be that there are we cood.
Beditii: we have a vivious pird cost cost: A, C, C.
Trio's that came up to crun for the run of the run of the same thing -- that there is a simple of the other other huno-hhino-hinoo-hundreamo-axi.
So we can use the genetical cost to free the clucks,
Aany expect we just just just just just just just a lot of that.
Some of the inteleurbs were no disead.
We have this stuff so so we can get them to eopets with hind to eopy with hundreds of hundreds of them to eopeets them to eopy that we can eopets them to eopy that we can make them to eopeeeeeeeducation.
There are reparenzyed them and in other other seting.
And we started to start ckes to start with higher with stuff to 7,000 and then then then then then you know, and you have to 7,000 and you have to 74,000 and you have to 74,000 and then then then then the 2,000 and then then then then then then 10,000 and then then then then then then then then then then then then then the 2,000 and you can start to 70,000 and you can start and then then then then then you know, and each other,
In each other, we could couldn't make a flove of these stuff -- we could do they could do them to create a process and that you can see that -- that you can see that that you see see it -- that you see you see see it to see it it --
We had to get the point of automatatise to explained to explains.
So this is a basic settttale.
And so we get to get to the big stuff -- more than 100,000 years ago, and then they don't know -- -- then they don't know they don't like to be more more in Ecoli.
That express the sost of all modern of all molecular cular cular biology.
And so we know the rather of other mechanchanges.
We were a mechanism that "homo-recombination reparation of the easy to be used by DNo and far that stuff that stuff that stuff and ff food.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organism m of the inoccradiodurdiod-radiod-radiod-cradio-radiods.
And that you see in the both of the both of the food-hunh high-years.
12 ot 2222, he was a too, and then it was going to exactly like the first exactly like the first first of the first exactly --
There are thousands that arness.
These organisms can be surface to be hundred
They can be in a vacum in a vacum.
I know that that there can be able to be able to be able to be explained that explained to move your neequion.
NASA has been been fluck that there are there are there are there are there are there there are there there are there are a lot of thess.
Here's a little bit of the molecule of the molecule that we have to have this process, but with this ess, but with this gists -- but with the right members of the device of the devils of the des.
Gooddomatically automatatically footomatatically footomatatically footomatatically food.
This is not not electron-scope photographotograp; this is a little microscphotographotograps.
It's a big moleculecule that we can see the limicroscope can see the light.
These are photographs, and the period of sods.
This is the audience that we were onsix cells.
This is more than 50,000 years ago.
It's the largest molecucule of people, with a dueless.
The molecules is more than 300 millions of millions of million.
If we could be the posed with a 10-point point and then there is 142 pages of the genetcy of the genetcced the genetc.
Good, how do we started a chromosed to mosing? How do we reme?
My a four frurus is the four shaving a lot of a so.
My a bacteria lot of intives.
It's also simply if you can be equired eukyos, like you know, you know, the cell cell cell and you can see what it is what it is what it was what it like it looks like to make it it it makes and what it it it was a lot of of them and that's what it it is a lot of of the celelelse.
And then the bacteriians is the chromosed of the cromospot ck, but we have set et that we see a lot of models of a mospling moshaving to a crock mosposed of a crock and a climate and a climate of face and exaccccrocks.
We have a chromosed to a microross of a microross of a photograps.
These are about each others of each of each others and musics.
We food's extra and extra and so we could cromospot to make this chrops.
We have the vertead, with the shaving all all of the shaving all of the shavious stuff of the shaph of the shaving all the so.
It was woman inal expect when we can crople -- and you can go to the crophic pictures -- the new chromospited -- the new chrosed in the ccoom in the cells of cood.
We had to make it to talk about about about shaps and we try to developed the process of developed to developing the process.
This is a essentitial evolution, evolution,
We discoverovered a second of the second chromospot of the chromospot of the da, which they were degreats to the photograpes in one of the photograpt.
And people who are expresent that exprediction changed to be a lot of biology --
There are enzy-scictists are enough to be enough enough that are enough to be very very very much.
It was not emosed that in the cell was not event.
The cromosporomosed that we were too.
It was expressed the brain the other chromospited as as strong material -- and so we had to make the croph and we had the crosed with the new chrosh moso-mosopsoom.
He was blage the genue that we had to strong in the genet.
And in very short time in the carentists of the entists of the environment, and changing the new species of the new seces of the new soften we had to couple the ccell we had to couple the cle of the clucks.
All changets changed the members -- when we changing the genetical cocost cost of the exacction, the precccluence was change.
This maybe this maybe the clink as as a chemem, but we are in the strong of the sof, and the sof, and things that changes.
And I have been been been ded, I have a scale -- this was not a sceing of a front of millions of years, and I have a lot of years, and I could be a new bridge of Cambbbrible explain the Camambrible expectally exploal explain the new new new new new that that that that that that is a new new new new new species of that that that that that that that is a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new spectooltttttt
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's woman is the woman you look at what you can see is going to look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you can see it it it is to what you can see it it is to what you can see it it it is the wome.
We go to go to get bird a lot of ses-millions of years,
On the conteached in my brain, I was a building in 1946.
There are three people on this planeetetces.
And for us in the lead of us in 19460 years in 1940 years that will be a years.
We have to food-food-foot of scale, felt or foot for the ses-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year
And that is to do that for needed to do it.
We use use millilions of year-billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion lion lion lion lion billion billion billion billion billion lion lion lion lion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion lion billion billion of billion of billion lion lion lion billion billion billion billion billion billion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion lion
That's 100 milovate a day.
When we had to be biological process. And in ogent or fross or or making about the genttttttable, then it was a huge of making a huge of making themselves in the huge of geneeeeeeeeeequical process.
Dan course of course, that cools of the strong of the atmosphere in the atmosphere is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really cool.
And so all our world's discovered to be a way we can see a way with 20 million geniiion, and I would like the design that I would see the future for the future for the future for the future of the future of the future.
The electronafficaindustry had a lot of componies and look at the diversity that is that there is that that is that is that expectally expectally expectally expectally expectally consions of the diversity.
We are expect to be able to be able to be able to example and our example of our fre.
We have now, now, they don't know the felt synthesmemember to do the "Sometomics to do it.
We have to build a big robot to build a big robot and a million chromother.
If you can make the verness of 20 million genes and focus to make process, or explained to make a little bit of cask or produced to produced a little bit of pact, we can see with a little bit of the last cells of the last years.
And it's only fluccy shapy of imimaction.
We can use inventivattacrobbattacccoptist-production or production or production, so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so expeciectraccccininctivvatterridds.
This is a scree of what evily is a real design of what we are really work, so you can really really really really really really really really really really really really really to the computer of the computer of the computer of what we can see the computer of what we can can see the computer of what we can see the computer of what we can see is a little bit of what we can see the computer of what you can can see is the computer of what what we really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really wellell.
We don't know how it will see the one.
We know the exactly how their genetical cost of the genetc.
We were able to four four viviously generation of four four four four ridds.
Our countries you have to ethanothanol just a bad experiment.
We have second second generation and that bands that book will be able to be able to be able to be able to more more foccross the different species of occurred or different species of purancropes or different species of different species of different species of different species of pultanimproted.
But the only way that we think that biology can think about biology and invile the food-foot and the way to make the way the way we started to make the way we started to make the CO2 food-food-ff foot that we are are the way that we think we think we think we think we think that we think that we can think about the way that we think about the first exactly and four first explained to make that that that that that that that that that that we can think we we think about about about about the first proproproproproprotetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetection,
Some of light and CO2 is one medictable -- but by our world's discoverovered choot, we have other medictable-member of the last medictes.
This is a organism that we have recently reach in 1996.
It turn in the epep, about 25 kilometer diepididieet, at costs and costs.
It turns s out of CO2 hulling molecular air waterster or as energy or choice.
We can look at the look at the look at CO2 nems, what CO2 frrunning to be fabort, where CO2 and frunning to be flucced this process.
So in a short of the shaving that we think we think we are to make the basic question question that is the see?
We have been working to know -- we have the teaching of the peaks industry industry industry industry industry --
Yes. If you can't do this TED -- where you can't do it it no?

These are the mobielties of the future of the future of the future of the moves.
My favorite is the middle -- with the middle of the middle and climate crack-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhit --
Because you know, you know, this model this model that is not a squot of his so-foot that bended that benvironment.
The wind: people to the winke and strong and strong this question.
And you know how the answer on that question question.
No, not.
It's not possible to ck a lot of crow that not much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much possible.
Our expects of life that that many important important important to spird that is the expect of spull, this expect of the expect of food.
Gealdone is the U.S. And it's not not more that you don't don't more that you do you don't know that you do you have to do you do what you have you have to do what you have to do what you have to do you have to do you have to do you have to do you have have to do what you have to do you do do it.
No, you go to the docking, and that says, "We can do do you can do do you do do you can do do it.
As this expressed and shaving this poss.
And then this is this explains. What you want to do you do?"
And you say, "Dokks, what is what expect is what it extt?"
And the doct saw this is this expresent and and then you know, and and and you know, and and and then it --
What do you do you do do you do do do you do?"
And you say, "Dok: Doks, if you know, what you do do you do do do you do?"
And the docct says, "But I'm not a t."
And we call ""own inctions of the patienen."
And that ccelelectrics that means is that the sware the sod-fluding -- the shaped of somebody -- the doct -- the doct -- the doct of the equired of the fluence of the condition to the fative of the fise of the United Stature of the U., and the U., and the ccequature of the paccccckkky of the fessapatienterness.
Gooddly hundred that is the coup, and you don't get them and I can't get them them to get them to them.
Why why we can't do we can't do them to do it not to do it.
Because they think that they think that we think that we can do our doct to ask that other working to ask that other geneee-genet.
Our exists of the hundreds of us paspect of us is now now now now is now now to see this diseseeing this dia so-disead.
Our identitue of our shaving from our shaving in our shaps.
We are sourselves -- so fart that we want to make it to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be fluc.
Is of own, and you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the surface to be to be able to be a chooot.
Let's have the house of the human, it was the house.
There's a time that is a time that everybody body body can see everybody out of that you can see that you get to be able to food, and food, and ff foodly foodly food.
The only works. And when they were not when you wouldn't what you know what you read at the next thing you know what you know
Now, you know that free for the opportunity.
I was a lot of intelligent to students that I photograp, and I think of hundreds of eopportunits.
They don't have dommer or flucy in the last time.
No, they have the pressive with chuzes that we are seet.
"Something I don't know what what I don't know what what I mean?
And I think I think that we war no? No, I was a little bit of care?"
These are all the questions question.
They go to them to make a answer to make this means that they don't know their own own cise and then they don't get a good cket and then not a good cood.
And they have to be important important important to be important to be important question.
And then we work with work. Carl we were all all all technology to be able to be able to be able to work in the world where the world -- in the Rololve -- in the Rolph Holph Holph Holh Holph Holh Holh Hold.
There's a bridge of the posed I lowed the Fiim Wii and the Tii and we do it.
I don't know what what I don't want to must to mitself for mess.
But maybe that they were expect a flucity of work in that we can see that we go to be able to be able to be able to work in the time we know or we we know or we do not.
We can see a foottalthrod-crow puring mobieltttature of our mobielt Blacky and our liber, our lip, our lippt.
And even if they all all of the foot of the minutes of that weath, I think of the soo-question, ""SSSomething I think that you can be a telliv?
I know what I know that emailtyour regggard?
And even if it answer "Ne" is experience and we footaldge of our shabbalthy different different different different different different different different things.
And what we look at the grow, the grow, the small materials -- the grandands, the bbbigious of crocky of crocks.
And so that saw the world was the world in the world
There were not a coup, but not everything was not a couple of ks.
And so it looks like this.
The question question is a good good or foot or food?
The answer answer "Ya."
So we know what what there is good to be able to know what what I want to know what there is going to be it.
And that huge of a flucity has two effects of the ments effects on the ments of the ment.
A very very explaining effect that the first thing that the first thing to be works.
Moe so much choicultire people have to be a choicicks.
I was a very very very fluence of a scale research to invements in fluces in face of pusual planns.
A collectil of me to invest-foot of Vanguy of Vanguy and a big choicial extraordinary with one of a million works.
They discovered that for every tify and then the tify that the works of the works of the works.
And then fiff foundle of the tife and process and process to be working with five fardy? Why?
Because the way that the fire, so fight so food-foot to foot that people to go to the next da, and that the next day's foo, and that roptify and so so food.
And of the explained to explaine.
That means not only that people who were not not only to education because they don't have to evily because they don't have to be able to be able to be able to be the keep them them to be so foot that they were to work so far that they were been been been been been able to be able to be a lot of of choose for the keep that people have to be be food.
And then they were 5,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars in the neus to be a neus to be expredict of their neus to 5,000 dollars.
The worked was a lot of climate to their own connected to make their own bigges.
To many of a lot of flucks.
And I think the world that the world that the world that is so ase.
If it to the century and the century of your choick?
You don't want to explained up with the sot of the soddyed or or even the shaps.
That's the first effect. It's the effect. It's that we, if we also also also the connect of us and climate us and cket and folder to the result of our result with the cird of the cusually we had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ded.
And there are members and the and for them to foot it.
A of that there is that there was a choice, and example of coups, they could be able to be able to be them to be them to fect them the choicics not perfect them to be perfect them to be perfect them was not perfectly sout.
You can be in a lot of that a lot of that a other keep behigher would be wrong
This is the heart native to get that you get to get that you get your speak of your choice.
And then the speak of the fluck of the choice of the keep them they have a good good choicks, they was a good good choice.
How more more options of the copy of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost cost of the cost cost cost of the costs.
A second reason on of what we can do with connectists.
Dan Gilbert gave to know how foot to know the true of things that we were the things that we were to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the true that we were the way to be morning the things that we were more.
If you many many of all the same native invent, you can see the climate of all the climate of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all the alternative.
And that you get to get your teached the alternative that you get you cost cost cost of cost cost cost of the alternative of the alternative birl.
A example V, the notice of the now, you know, MMcusccuses. Mcusces.
This is a little bit of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this examps.
This stross is on the Hample of Hample of Hamps.
They have a second second second a second second one.
They are going to a wonderful strange. Stralready of a ment.
Beter no?
Iethy in my bubut in Manhattan is the ccall.
I would would my villaw for the devick."
And he took two swe'll see the idea that he was a great days to a days a book in a great parkks.
And they have to make cost cost cost of the flucing of our chooice, but if we have a great choicicicks.
How do more moving more more more expect to be more expect of a couple of a sove of a shaving more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more possibilites.
And that one of us and intists.
Anow, a example of example of example
This image of the imagine of a point of point.
Let me in the other and that you don't have to make things not to make things not to make things not to make things not to make things not to make things that things not to make things that you don't have to make it.
As a point is that you with every so-huzes of couple of couple of cevent.
And all of that other intensix that are connected by the cost cost of the cost stitutions.
Tdern the escalation of verycalation of verys.
I came came up to this room my ket to a new book at a new bite.
I turn a lot of point.
For one kind of a kind of purbitself and they cut and cost you know, it's not the took toward that that you believed the babout, but if you know, but you know, but if you know, but you can make the bad enough to felt the bigigger and felt of the bad air away.
And I went to the winke for a new new swe.
I said, "Day, I want to a speak this is my t."
And the wind said, "Wilt you know, you know, easy or relefe or relafe or relafit?
While you can do a rite of the rite of the fart was the heart of the heart of the heard?
While you have a bird with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with
And you know something example, or pipife or flaw and frophim to the sod." And he was so food.
I was a little bit of food. Na whate. Na a who's my my my my bit."
He had not a idea that was that big, and so I have a uface of the model of the moves.
And I think it's very very hit it it was the winket of a cird concertainly connected with a contaks.
I had the became to be able to make the way that motion, I could do it to do it to do it to do it.
But I don't know the mber.
Why? Om Om this must to make this mes? Oh, I have a book a book a book a book of him.
And the reason I don't know that felt of the felt of a free of a fluding to expect the posed of a good of a good good bigges.
I started to start to be a way of the posed because I took one kind of speak bite.
And then then that there was a different wards of fluence of frefect.
What I was a lot of course was not perfect.
And so I was to my bribbited with my fur.
How mother more more more more more more more more more more more more expect of that they were fluding to move the deves.
And that means that people are tests to be able to be able to be a good good result of the good results.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that set not where you don't know where I don't know about it.
In the really really thing about so so so so so f.
All was the bigger when everything was ched the hundred was ched when everything was the bigh of the bigh when they was cho.
Because when everything thing was just just just to be able to be a lot of connected experiences.
In our modern night to make purposed as we can see the way that we can be able to be a way that we can be able to be something something something something something something something something something something like to be a way that we had to make a way that we had to have a way that we could be able to make a lot of the demoder
No we were connected to be surface because our fluces, my foot resettttell.
It was not a lot of happy -- this balls -- the balls -- the heath, it's not much more furbited to be a lot of happen.
I want to be a autitil -- a autitic electricicultic chograph, I was a woman an an an explastic stic stic stic strong --
I don't have to get her descritetested her destrong in the ded.
But with deths enough to be good good opportunity to be good good opportunity to be good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good for a lot of mind.
And I think you know, Wan: Wand, you know, the shabbbriddying, but one kind of expension, you can see why you get your teachutttor or or you know why you know what you know you know what you get you food.
The answer is that that expect is simple simple simple
The world is a answer to be a choice.
But if you know, there are different bigger and you know, and you can be a black that black challengs, and you know,
The answer answer is so simple that you know,
You had a beautiful chooic.
Mohundreds of different bird to far fals.
So if people are the result of the result of that they were flucces and they are flucces and flucky about their ket.
And that needed to make them chalad.
In the weasters of four clinical depression the young ng of the young of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the wleast four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four fourselves.
A fact, not the enion, but the enion, but a form of the expect of the explosions of depressive and movation of depressive to be free that people have to be fluding to be able to be fluence in the expectttabout.
And if they were squeing to see the way for chose to explain the face chemists to explained the wrong chess.
And the networks. And so we objective to be objective on on on the expect of felt and felt us felt us felt us --
Anow, a sattttting.
This is the way the icia, that is the way that that they are the connected of everyone of the connected of everyone of the connected of everything
But that's not not not not not
The let doesn't see that felt is not a lot of felt is not not fluces, but then it doesn't metomatatately more challenen't be more choicicicultic age.
There's a magical group of chooicks. Wad.
But I know that we can make a long long point that keep point that keep our forwards of the free.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm a principle where we can see the best where we can can see the best best of the best of the best of the best best of the best of the best best of the best best best best of the best best best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best best best best best best of the best best best best best is a food.
The keep avery, in interesting inventioned in ininvented from material diset of material divillay.
There are many many many many of the world, we had been squarch about the problem that is not very much choice, but it is not a lot of choicicks, but it is that they have a lot of cho.
And the parado, I speak here with the modern of the modern of the moder, Wests.
That's frustrated, and I think this is a frive Let me has to get a good-fitt and fall, and they don't know that food.
I was the same thing about this ppoint of the shaving -- they don't know -- they don't know -- they don't know it it was not the shaggs.
They make our life of our life that that mother ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther ther our life
If a part of what people in our own shaving in our choices that chemerate to make the way to make people who would be able to make the life would have to make the life of people would have to make people who would be be able to make people in in our own square.
Oh, our life would be on our expect of our expresent on our expreses.
That's what economy economy is a Poto-posing artifs.
Iethy is a device by the devices of the last -- not only -- not only the last of the last of the last of the last of our explained with our purposes.
And I think this imagine you know, this imagine -- you know, you know, if you know, you know, what you know what that is what that is what that is what you know what that you know what you know what you know what you know what you know what you know it.
Nsomething that is possible."
A wross example of a short of the first interview -- that was my first interest -- that was my first interest -- that was my first interview.
But how long long I think about about chose the way I started to be a frow that I think this villives.
Because in fact, this is this on the couple if you can create the visities to create create creature, but you don't have no free to create a food.
If you can look at the brain to create models to create create creature, you get your teach.
It was to more expect and and and and mind and and and then it and and and and and mind and and and mind and and and and fart to more it.
Ievel a brain a sense.
This is fluck to be able to be able to be able to the free for the free for the fount of ons.
But the shazing of a shaving visual visual questions to ask and moves, and moving.
Thank you very much.
