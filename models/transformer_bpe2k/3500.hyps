The s@@ he c@@ ou@@ r@@ e is is that is that is that is that is that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that s@@ om@@ e@@ 's s@@ om@@ e@@ 's going to h@@ at@@ .
Y@@ ou@@ '@@ r@@ e was a b@@ ac@@ k to be a b@@ ac@@ k to be a b@@ ac@@ e.

So if people are people people people are people are people are people to be to be the s@@ y@@ e@@ n their s@@ y@@ st@@ s and they were the s@@ y@@ st@@ s are the s@@ y@@ st@@ s of the s@@ o@@ s of the s@@ o@@ w@@ n they were the s@@ el@@ l of their o@@ w@@ n their s@@ el@@ l their o@@ w@@ , they were their s@@ el@@ e@@ n their s@@ o@@ .

And then we have a little b@@ i@@ e@@ n to be a little b@@ ac@@ e of this is a s@@ y@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ e of this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this s@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ al s@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ l their h@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ al s@@ y@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ t their h@@ er@@ e@@ n their h@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ er@@ s of their h@@ o@@ w@@ n their h@@ o@@ w@@ n their o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ .

The c@@ ou@@ r@@ se@@ , is that we think that we think is that we think that we have to be that we have to be a s@@ om@@ e@@ n of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y to be a s@@ y@@ e@@ n to be a s@@ el@@ y is the c@@ am@@ p@@ l@@ y, but we have to be th@@ e@@ y@@ m@@ .
N@@ o@@ w@@ , a very m@@ on@@ al s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ on@@ .
This is the f@@ ir@@ st of the s@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ e that that that that that that that that that that we have a b@@ ac@@ k to be a b@@ ac@@ k to be a b@@ ac@@ k to be a b@@ ac@@ k to be a b@@ u@@ p@@ le@@ .
But that's the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d is the c@@ ou@@ l@@ d.
The c@@ ou@@ n@@ d not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not to be that that that that that s@@ om@@ e@@ n that not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not s@@ om@@ e@@ n to be th@@ e@@ y@@ '@@ t be not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not s@@ om@@ e@@ n th@@ e@@ y@@ m@@ .
