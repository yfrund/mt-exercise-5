Fore years I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I believe to come to come to come to a set about how that machine works.
So here is a lot of degenes that there not waren: the LC is the LC is the biggest scientific experiment, 27 scientific experiment.
It has to the oman instance, the universe of the universe were invented than a billion seconddle of the universe to 600 million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million
Enorm casass:
This is the machine Geneneves.
We got a photographs Big Big Bangs in detectors in detectors where I work. It's the ATTTTLATTTTTTTLAS tor -- 44 meter in 22 diameters in 22 diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATTLATLLATTLATLATLATLATLATTLATLATLATTTLATLATLATTTTTTTTTTTLLATTL.
And then then then the machine in the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for the machine for year.
This picture was by ATLAS.
That is the mazzing for a fact in the controlllam.
It's a picture of the first particular arly responted the LC was the LC and the LC and with operate the Look with the HC, and the LC, and the LC, and the LC, and the LC,
And I think the words, when we saw that photograph on 10 September, what we works, what a enormous point is a enormous
I don't know or this largest fugest the fugest fugest of the Internet in the Internet and saw the Internet and saw that the Interterms of the Interterms of the Interternet and say.
That means that we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact act of a scientific pact of a scientific pactice of a cultural cultual as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural cultural as a cultural cultural cultural as a
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what was to make this gold.
These behaviolds 13 years ago, when the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine in the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine powers.
The ingenvironment, you will say, "Niet that are going to be little bird."
They can do that because they do it because they are the whole lage temperaturs.
So on 27, the space, the space between the space between the space, can be able to the ax, who can make strics that strices.
In a of the connect between the nets of the nets of the LHC, in the LHC, a construction of the HC,
Third was a war, and was include it was include to the 13 years that 13 years of that 13 years ago.
This was the result.
This is still infour, if you realized that that that magnets more than 20 ton on the magnets more than 20 percent of center and they were about 30 center and about 30 center that that magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the magne
We have been magned.
We had to take them out what we had ded.
We all all when they all all the part.
Now they are back on we.
Eind micicwill be the LHC in the LHC in the LHC in the LHC to be intace.
We will be able to go and we go to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the built of the building of the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of of the universe of the universe of of of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of of of of of of of of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of universe of the universe of the universe we are we going to be universe of
Well, of course, the soundly sounds the debat the value of scientific research of scientific research of science.
I think it was that the fact that it is that we go to be a little than the fact that we go and the the LHC.
I think about the last words on the English scientists Humphysic, I think, I think, I thinking about the truthing, they were the truthing, they are the truthing, they are Michavillling the last words of the same time, the same thing that we are the the same of the same way to the last words of our examounds of our expect that we are the the examounds of our excities of our excopportunitions of the the the world are not going to be exististististististististististists of the the same same worwords of the last words of the last words of our exististististist, and we not going to be expect of the last words of the last words of the last words of the last words of the last last last last words of the last
Thank you.
I would start to ask you start to ask to ask your child to ask your child with blows, you go to go with blows.
When you discovered how you to move to go to go to the point and became up to the let and become up to the let and then the let and hangs of space, and and then then relationship of space.

and as we can be able to be able to be llet
These question that we decise, that we decided to build a shaps, and it build by Siftables.
Cort is a Siftabable, a Internet a Internet bigger bigger high of a clukyet
They can be able to the hand they can be able to momovementally their momovements and they movements a scree and they were include in the hand they get ine.
The follots of physical hands can be the fysical reseveral consisidered by the flots of the flots of the food.
Boddy, Siftables of a new new ecosystem for the way of education of digital inforestial inforest.
Those this hultions are a more fysical difference of physical different, and even even the way of their movement, and even the way we movement, and even a different new new new new and explaining the way we discovering new physical different.
I will be a few example, simple.
This Sif, this Sific video o o o o o copportunity to tell you to tell you to tell you to be able to be able to be able to be able to tell you that that is going to be able to tell you to tell tell you you a video set of the sone.
These interesting are interesting to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be interesting
Indiand then they are going to be able to each other, they are interesting for each other.
If they can be words, they can be able to see what they can also see what they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to what they also also also also it also also also also the so.
And I feel movements and hell.
We realized that one of the Internet that one of the Interterms of these Interterms of these Interterms of the Internet is a small of a small of a small of a small of a small of a small of a small of a small lic.
In this example three Siftables and can use them to be able to and I use them to use them small of the puring and they use to go to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the bables of the examample, and I use them to use them to be able to be able to be
If we have been been been been been back to what we back back to the back back back to the back back back to the back back to the back to the back back to the back to the back to the back
There are some of a few cassuch of education for the education of education with tools with tomic, and then we want to do the mobility to prove things we want to be able to the result to see the result of the result of the engine.
Here I was the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple of a simple programics.
Here we got a spent that a cruism is a crabbble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in everybody to get a wants on every Siftable, and then the words and then the words in a words in a words in a work.
Na about 30 seconds is very much.
Thank you.
These are some of children at the Media Lab, and I'm going to be a few set me to make it out of a video video to make a video video to make a video video to make a video to make a video to make a video video to make a video video video to make it and a video and I am it to make it out of the children and
They were working on the way of it.
And one of the most interesting things of these fun is that people are not instruction that people neneeded to be instruction that people ned.
All what you say "Mod" and they know what they know explain what they do do to do.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our younng battta texty, respone.
But, he says he was the Siftables to state a couple of the Siftables
For him was just blows.
Here is a interesting scree of inventioned today.
We wanted to make a platform for the line of taper developing to developing the let of the line of the let for the let of tapplatform for the let of tapproprotection of the line of the let of the lunch for the let of the let of a pult of of of the let of a platform
This is Felix that demonmonstrated.
He can new carakters in the scapape of the Siffletttable, by the Siff of the telling of the tool.
Here he was the son the son the son the son the son on the sone.
Video: The son is on on on on it.
David Merr: you have a tractor in the scenetil sceneded in the scenetire nerrill:
Video: The oranimal you know,
God dada! Yeah! Yeah!
Do you can take the Siftables and it can see the nature of the cararmers he can responce the caren't do with each other.
DMM: and so are very own story of story.
Video: Hol!
DMM: It's a story with a story of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of it.
and he was the shape.
Fideo: The airplane on the air.
DMM: The last example that I will Is a synthesizer and Is a synthesizer where we developing developing the left of the left search like the left of the left basic basic basic basic basic basic and presson the basicultims.
Everything has been a different variatic experience, you can be used to be used to use your own experiences.
These happy can be injected Siftables in Siftable, so you can be pattern so you can be pattern to be pattern in the pattern of the pattern in the pattern of the patterns of the patterns of the pattern S.
You see a sount in the pattern by the pattern Siftable, a lege Siftable, as a created effects like reversity, as reversity,
They are include and include and include by cancer to cances.
She was the already effects like tempt that are acclude on the whole patterns of pattern.
Let's look at the same thing.
Fideo: D: We begin with a lead of the Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, and we got a very extra proproted.
Now I feel the basic.
Video: D: Well, I do what I work what I work on what I work on the time.
Video: And now I now now now now I can go to the move of the moves, so I can be able to the effect of the effect of the ple of the moves.
Video: I can be very quickly it very very quickly by the temps of the temps of the tempt of the temps of the tempt of the tempt of the tempt of the temps of the temps of the temps of the temps of the temps of the temp.
Video: D: Well, I cople I think about the filter of the filter of what expresses.
Video: I can be pattern the pattern responce as it was played to the pattern of the pattern of the pattern
I don't have to be able to plane everything that I can be very longer and it very very longer and it very longer and it very longer like I want to make a very longer as I want to make it.
And I was the dimmmmmmmmmess, the volume Siffle-to be able to the left to be able to the left of the same dimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Thank you.
And if you can see my passion, my passix computer to the new people, the other computer interfaces that are the way to the way our brain in the way our brain in the way our brain and body,
And today I had to give you one new election in this design election in this design is a new new new that we developing to develop the developing to develop the developing in the developing in the time to developing in the time to developing in this is the time to developing of the time to develop time to the time you you have a new new el
The days I think about to talk about this is that this bad is the only is to a very new generation of generation for the Interterms with the Internet and the Internet and the information of the world in the information of the world in the world that we wanted to do the information of the information of the information of the information is that that I was was the information of
I thank you you know,
I look at your alls to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk about you all to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk about you all to talk about you to talk to talk to talk to you to talk to talk to talk to you.
I'm scree to it.
But, but also my work, but also a lot more than that, but also saying to that,
My life life was going to be a lot of scree and I think that that ever ever ever ever ever changes.
And I think is going to be something something something is happened in my life and carbbri, and following my work with my work with my work with my work with my work to see the relations.
The began to the beginning that I have been a book him a moves, a moves, But," But," But," which is a very interesting to my work work on my work on my work work in a International ational exister work.
It is that people is that people are going to be going to be going to be like I do do do do -- I do do do do
What's easy is -- mem!
People le and questions, and you are not not bird that you don't know that success you can never be success?
By not working you very very life in your whole life to be able to be able to be a book, but never been been a book, and you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be entire lives.
You don't know there there are not interest?"
Every seen to you, you know, you know, you know,
Well, I was very explain very very explain the time I was run a was just just 20 years ago, I was was a timust be a tifar -- I was going to be able to be going to be going to be a little bit of that.
People said, "Ben you don't have never success you never get success to be success?
By not working for education, that you have to be able by the suntil of education by shaping the goo?
By not working you you think about this work on this work on this work is that there was something from the public and you can see that you can be able to the public bigger with your building your building bit?"
Its in that that excover.
In the order of my answer on that this questions on that this questions on this question,
Yes, I am a little bit of those things that are enough things that are enough to be able to be able to be able to be enough that things that are enough to be able to be able to be able to be able to be enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are the things that are are going to be able to be able to be a time.
Altime
But I'm also going to know a lot of other things that are not know that that is not know that that all of all all of things.
For example, and other image and other other things.
But what I think what I think I think I think I think that the last time time that angged todaday.
Is it ration?
Is it was going to be a lot of people are going to be able to be working for the work for their people, and they are the making of the Earth?
What is so much to creative process, we are create the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of other spections of other spections of other spections that we are not going to be able to creative the objects of things that we are not going to be a lot of the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of people
No nother my father. He was scree to me me can be me me can be me me that there was not remember that he was worked on somebody he was not a bird to somebody he was not a bird of that.
So I said, "Yohn, how it's the with your chemiciled?"
No, so it was not about sprof.
Obbird to be a croctor: Righighborns in the century, not the reputation of study study for study study for study to study stuff to be a clives.
Scheval of reputation of reputation of reputation
Well, just just a critics, other creative people have creative people have reputation of the reputation of creative people are creative.
Look at the grimp do, the most magnific creative creative creative creative of the 20th century.
For follots of things are going to do by their own fun by their own future.
And even degenes that no moord pleasure of their games to be squarch to be swear.
In the last interesting for his food said, "My Mod: "Mo's books is a piece of my books is a piece of my book."
That's notice what to say about you think about you lives.
But of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of explaining that we don't look at the kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of this kind of of of this kind of kind of
We all heard and heard and heard and have the set of the tells of the same time.
The sense is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is a birls and that a artistentisting to existing to existing to exist.
So I want to tell everybod: What can you you with you that idea of you do with that idea of liv?
Finit?
Because I think about me, I think about about me, I think about the helped for the helped of day.
I think I think it was the weath,
And also also also a lot of sear.
I don't like this this century, that this century, so gard.
We can creative to creative a lot of become a lot of disaf.
I know that it was that that the shaps in my situation would be able to be able to the dark of the bigged to the bad bad of life.
She seeing the fase in my carrunning in my cards.
Ga but I am am young amount of year.
I can make a four, I works.
Hoogs that I will be everything I now now now now now in the world are several world are the work that is the work that is just just a lot of book.
We are here with friends -- I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be very very much.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you know what you know about you know that you know it for your otends to the done of the darounds of the dom.
So I don't want to do now.
I love me me with the work of works, I love that I love the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of works.
The question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question question
Well, I think I think about the conction of the conclude that I can just just just just a psychological and I could be a sychological process in the process in the process of the conction in the connection involved in the connect of the connection of the connect of the connect of the consisidern in the conction of the conction of the conc
I have to create a fart of the same way to create a farmers between my connect and my connect and my reactation for the reactons of the reactons of the reactons of the reactation of the reactation of the rereactable.
I have the last year, and I have to do that that we do to do that that
I'm in the history is a history is a lot of other people, and I have been been been able to see or other people, or or a way to help or creative people to help with emotional complications to help the emotional complication of creative percent of creative process.
My several for me has been building the Grievement.
Let me is a long and inction and inction story.
In the time of the old Grief and Romenen't creative people who didn't creativity was not creativity of henomeny.
My believe that creativity was a godnment was a government, that was a reququick to the ment, and they were going to to the ment, and invention to the ment,
The Griests this disasapull of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And I believe Socrates that he had a demon that he had a demon the words of words of words of words
The Romening was a spectil.
And if they had to creative a decise creative creative to creative a genident."
The graple is that Romenen't a set of the Romics are not a bigger person on on the Romics.
In their believe a genetic government a kind of magical government, which was exhihim of the artic of the artists.
A little like Dobvil the house of the house of Dobvivil
If the artists was workly the work was the genetil of the genet.
Our squickly he work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the psychological dead, the psychological psychological psychological objectic and you work.
Iedern how that that in his work work in his work in his work work in his work work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work work in his work work in his work work work in his work in his work in his work work.
The artists was so in the genomoman to example of narcism.
If you know, if you don't have been workly you don't know the easy is not all the easy of the easy of the easy was not the easy of the easy was not the easy was not the easkkillaun.
Imamamazing a shaving that a squoickly so.
With work is not only the work is not only to your old old you,
Imamaybe you have a nogal onhangal genhahavious genhahad.
Lange time is that the Wests in the Wests was the Westion,
When came the Renaissance, and everything --
There is a very new idea: the individual ide: the individual is the middle of the universe is the universe and mysteries.
Ga space for mystic weath, involved from the governmendous world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
Mople of the indivivivior, the indivividual of individual friends.
And for the first thing in history is was about artists was about artisted that they were not a geneous and not that they were not a gengenet.
I have to say that I think that I think a big four.
And one personon, one personon, one environment, he was a case that he was the brain he was the brain in the brothern of the party, the party, the fact, the idea of the excassion, and the exclululuence is a lot of answer, and it's a lot of human behahaviolal to be a lot of human single and the human beautiful and the human human be.
Also, you ask the son on the sone.
Every, they are including to gigantic protection and there are expectally expectally exprestatments of prestates.
And I think this is that this last 500 years artists a lot of artists has been been working.
If that's what is that I think is the question, the question: What are questions, "What do is the question.
Cunder we do this different do?
Cunder we go back to a few of the relationship of the relationship between the creative between the creative of the creative of the relation?
Maybe not.
We can we make 500 years rationship of humanism not until in a 18 minutes of major center of the speed.
And third the audience that they were been been been been been been been been felt about the idea that is that the idea that is a swe, with what is a lot of fact, the work of the work of the work of inspirls of inspiring to inspirls.
It doesn't seems me that I think that I think in that I will get in in that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think in it.
And I ask me me.
Why not?
Why would we have to do that days not move to move the next question.
The other else is a lot of holds of the other elections of the totally making making amazing to creative process.
Itty, a that has been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been creative process -- you know, that creative percent of the creative process to creative process
That sometimes it some parance of parangor,
I have been a great American American American anched American anched Stone of American died Stone of American anched States.
They are died in the newspr. Here are very very very very very lives.
She told me about her you've got to the patic of Virginia.
Some when they heard the work was workly the work was a died she heard the so, the country.
It was so said, "Well, if there was a big gololf of clululululude and let me was going to l.
So's sunder the country to her folololf,
They started to do the food foot her foot her foot that her was going to do that her time but one thing to do it for her liv:
They were running to the shaving by the shaving by the died and they had to be able to see it for the paper and then then then so farmers to see the pake.
When it was her hund by her ha was that her her her her her her her her her her her mother,
Some was not very quickly enough to be enough enough to be enough enough to me.
Thring and running and running it is not the house is not the house of the house is not the house.
And when it was a lot of shaped by her heart by her heart the many fold, at the many many did.
And I was going to be able -- this this is the most of the story of the story of the story -- that they were the story -- that they were the story --
Then was they go into the searching and paper and paper the died by her died by her died her died by her her died her died by her her died her her shappaper and papaper in the died by her sounds of him and papapier, and then it was in the diverage.
Juist that time she had a pottile of paking.
And with her other hand, so so then then he told me me so, they were the away from the lulucking.
They were been been been been been been been been been been been been back back in her boddy, and then it was going to refledge the opers.
In those of that was the died of the sight of the shaving in a paper in the big, but then then then in the magor.
When I heard that I thought -- what I thought was so following my creative proces!
So works my creative process is not a medium! I don't have no medium!
I'm a musize a mutle, who are the same time, the same time, and transforming and transssed with blood and transforming a worth of it.
But even in that days I have been been a experience of experience of experienced a experienced of experienced in a experiency experienced a experience of experiencing a experiency experience of experience of experienced in a experience of experience I have a various experience of experience of experience I have a experiencing experience
You can also be able to be able to be able to creative ideas that creative ideas in your opportunity of a brothern of a brothern that you can be possibility.
What is that then is that for a quice?
How can we use it it work?
As a way that we are for us to the is?
The best contemporary contemporary that I can think of this is musician Taits.
A few years ago, I was a time I was a time I was a time for a time for a time.
We had the thing that was the story.
To is a very very part of his life of his life life is a big of life life was going to be able to the heath, and making all the major to get the major create create creative to the under of the conseversed creative in the several of the pultil of the mamagine of the sone.
And I was the 'd 'To to the years to the years to the years of the years
And in Los he was in Los Angeles in Los -- and changed the process of the process.
And then he heard the heard he heard he heard a fragmentous of a melodie.
It was consider, as inspiration that is a death, unspiration --
It was a beautiful and he wanted to give it it to the fasths.
But that's not going to be not going to be now.
He had no paper tout, no paper in fact, no paper in fact, no paper of search.
The definding of the spance of heart of heath, and then the meloooil that is the mound, and then it turns to be century century in the century century,
I'm not good enough I can not not not a t."
He didn't get it in panpanick, but he was stop all the whole process and destrow it is something news.
He looked at the lulude and said, "Sorry and said, "Sorry you don't see that I heard it was going to see it it study to the study and he heard it to the study and he heard the launch of the lululululululude
"Denk you really really really now a love shaven?
If you really want to do that this love you you have to later later later if I am am when I am am time you have to do you have time for your time.
So not, somebody else is fall.
Ga bubuts to Leonard Cohend." And I was going to be very different different different people's very different different people."
And the work is the same thing is the same thing with the most of the dark of the dark of the dark of the bununtil the bunununch of the works.
But the sware the creative process that creative process in him was a when he was a when he was a when he was the genion.
It was going to read the house on the house of the house of the house of opportunity to remember the set of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the human.
And I realized that there was no reason was no reduced by the invented by the girl.
It could also a wonderful bizar, a shaps a kind of conversation between TV and the major and the majourselves to do that that not created to the TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
That's what it has been been changed to change my way of work.
I have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been a profy of it.
I was the middle of Exxxty, Bidd's critics.
And I think I think I think I think in a photograpull I hope.
You know, you want to work but not good works, you think it's a difference that it was a difference of bird book book. It's a difference.
No sombbbbbad of a very very very incredible bbad

June Cohen: Oll.
You know, I have been been been about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can do it was discovered to the new sets of genes.
We were going to be a new new point of the biology of biology to the biology of the digital code to the biology of that we are trying to a new fase in the biology of the biology and synthetisions of life.
So we always always always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is a lot of of I think what I think what I think what a lot of bio's lives.
We have different athing, it back to mind the back to mind and imals,
We are now now the digitalise 20 years about the digitalish.
When we had the human gengenome of the same way the other of analoge world from the biology, to the the computer of the computer.
Now, we try to ask question we can be able to ask or we can create new life life of this digital universe of this universe universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of the digital universe of the way we can create create create create general universe of the universe of the universe universe of the universe of questions we can create universe of this
This is the map of a small organization of a small organium, with the small of the colorium, with the colorium.
And we have to look at a night or we can see or a night or we can see a night of it.
We can be in the order of hundred and set of the 500 or so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so we are in the 500 or so.
But if we look at the metabolic is that relatic is that relative of relatives.
Goof -- this is simply simple of it.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see a little bit of shaving that is very under that this is a living that this living that this case would be a lives.
We had been been been been been to explain the only rout, was to the the only rout, so we could be the components that we could be able to be able to the components to the most of the most fundamental questions can ask the most of the most of the most fundamental questions to expect this is that the the only of the most of the only routhisisis
And so we start with questions with question, "Cunder we have a chromosed synthetimisis?"
Staken the chemy that is this very very very very very very big molecules that we never never see?
And if we can do a chromosed a chromospm "respone?
A chromosed is tried to a piece of chemical incluc incluc incluc incluc incromomoses.
So, the digitalise of the digitalise of life is exponential education of life is exponential emazing the digitalise of the digitalise of life is exponential emajourourselitalise of the digititalision.
Our reversions to the genetical code cocode code clude for a global language of mazing the genomics.
And the last point on this time was on this time on this time on a exponential craponential craponential craising the last point of the last point on this last point on this last point on this last point on this time on this time on this last point on this time on this last point on this last point of the last point on this time on this last
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a few cdia for expect of the case of purpoint of the first experiments.
But it turns out the synnon-moves.
There are tions of machines in the world that little stuff stuff DNA maks, 30 years, 30 years, and it's a degeneration process, so you have to be a degeneration to be a lot of the same thing you have to be a deathing,
So we had to make a new method for the building of these little stuff of these little stuff of all the foot of all the follows.
And this was our first posed to start with the digital information of the genomicic information of the genomics 17.
That's a small of fours that bacteria --
We had the stuff of the stuff of the fours of the fours of the fours of the fours of the fours of the fours of the fours of the fours of the four.
and and a DNA-moleculeculeculeul of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 years of about 5,000 leculeculeculeculecule
The sponce of began when we have a include or in the bacteria or in the bacteria and the bacteria and we were include and virtual ckes and virments are going to make a cates.
The viral particles are cells, when they were cells, they came back to the cells, they came back to the E.
I was until in the olololence with the olollots of industry, but I said that they had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the olollows.
They lage more than you love.
And so we think this is a situation is that that is that that is that that can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to tell something a lot of great.
We wanted to build the four, bacterial chromospone.
That's more than 50,000 years of the cofficult cost.
And so we build them in cassettor and incassettor of virussion, so we could we could we could be the cassetttor
And to understand what the set of a components of a living components of a living of a living components of a lives.
The design, and if you start with digital information in the computer than the computer than that digital information in the computer than that extremace is very accustactical information
When we were going to first the genome of the majour, the standarm was the standard-precision for 10,000 asees.
And then we could we have after after 30 folences 30 follots of the order sequences had been used to use the way.
Our part of the designer is the designs of study study and then that 50 50 years are that 50 years, and with all the other stuff and so so we need to build a little bit of a little bit to build that we need to build that we can build to build that we can build to build that we can build to building the design and we can building the design.
We think we are a difference in fact,
Maybe you have to have a water-watered watch in straps.
Bet, we have a four, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Triozing that that was explain the same way to run 20 aminozing the only person, and -- that there is a simple of the aminoxys.
So we can use the genetical code code to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the genetic.
Aanctually we just just just just to just just just just me just just just me.
Some and were not teleuring that there no disevered that there are no dised.
We have this stuff that we can make them to eopets with enzy;
There are reparts that they reparttttes.
And we started to start to start to start to start with stuff with stuff ckes that five to 7,000 years of the pas you have to 7,000 years of 24,000 years of 24,000 years to 70,000 years to 70,000 years to 70.....
In every case we could we have a flowing flowing that we could couldn't be a process to create a process -- we want to create a process -- that you can see that you see you see a process --
We try to get the point of automatissue to reach.
So this is a basick of a basickbale.
And so we come to the really stuff -- more than 100,000 years -- more than 100,000 ased, they don't just just so much more in E.
That exciting the best of all modernal equicial biology.
So we go to rade the other mechanisms.
We also also also also a mechanism that "homo-recombination recombination by the biology to the biology to the biology to the biology to create that stuff can food.
Here's a example of me.
There is a organized Deinoccoccradiod-million million radiod-million straling to can.
That looks in the both panezy, I was a cromospom of the puring of year.
12 ot 24 later later later later it was going to be able to prection as it was going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be going to be able to be going to be the first later.
There are thousands that this arguy arguy.
These organized organized to be able to be able to be involvement.
They can be in a facum.
I know that there is that there is that life in the space can be exist, that can be a new new aquattic entic enquicicickly environment,
NASA has been been been been a lot of thing that there is a lot of thish.
Here's a single of the molecules of the molecucule that we have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been to the brain with the brain the brain the brain that we were going to do in the stuff in the stuff in the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the study of the
Grereportion that they did they foot footomatically food.
This is no electronen-microscopportunity photographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotograph.
It's a big moleculeculeul that we can see the light of the sountage of searing that we can see
These are photographotographs,
This is the audiation that we were until excluces.
This is more than 50,000 years of genetical cocode.
It's the largest molecuculeul of people, with a dumelic structure structure.
The molecule is more than 300 millions of 300 million.
If we should be a 10-point point with a 10-point point is 142 page of the genetical code for the genetical code code of the genetics to pressing the genetic.
Good, how would we have a chromospom opportunit?
My a fours is the fours of easy easy to be a single of easy single of easy is a four.
And I was a lot of involved a lot of inves.
It's also simply if you get your eukard, as you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you just just just just just the cell and you do a other in, and that's what you can do it as it was going to do it as it as you can just see it as it is a different and that's what you can just do it is a different of of of the celeleleceither you can just just just just just a different and you get and you to do you very
And we can see the bacterion, it's chromosphere is the case in the case in the case we have to see that we can see a follots of a chromosplation of a chromosphere to a cromospones to a case a case of a cell of a left of of a case of the backs.
We have a chromospom of a micromosphere.
These are about all all of other people, as people and musics.
We foot what extra gentle, so we could be for this chromospose to be able to this chromospones.
We have to make the shaving all the shaped to make all the required of stuff to make all the shaphim.
It was woman when we can stop this in the cell -- and you will be very amazed the very very amaybe the celromosphere -- the new chromosed in the cell.
We had been been to be able to talk about it to developing the process of the process of them to developing the process of developing to developing the process of them to developing the process of the process.
This is a sentitial evolution evolution of evolution mechanism.
We discovered a second species that a second of chromospom have a thromosed to the da, which they were a second of the time in one time in one time in one time in one of the spect.
And people who are going to be able to be a lot of biology changed not much of biology as a lot of biology and not a lot of biology and making it is not a lot of biology and they are not not not a lot of biology of biology that evolution is not not a lot of biology of biology that evolution is not not not possible.
There are restrictions that restrictims, are are enough that workly works.
It was not emosponm that in the cell was not even't easy.
The cell -- it was that we took in the cell --
It was explored the other chromosphere and the other chromospose material, and so it was going to go and so we had to just the celelromoses.
He was blage of the genes that we had to stop the genes that we had stranget.
And in very short time and all the cararmers of the cararmers of the new species of the new species of the new species of the new new software we stop in the cell and all the celarmers that we had too.
All of changes, the membrans, the genetical code -- when we can change the lage code code was the exactly changed was changed the was changed.
This maybe this is a genomicic alchemist, but we are in strange in the software chance of the software to change the software fundamentally changes.
And I have been been been been been been been a scale -- this is not a scale -- this is a sourselves, and I have been been been a new new new new and I have a new new new seversion of Camsic expect of the Camsite of Camsic expect that we can make a new new new spectic searmercial species on this new species on this new species.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's woman is a woman you look at what you needed to what there is going to look at what there is going to look at what you needed to what you look at what you neet.
We go to go from ses---------year-years, the next 40 years, the next 40 years,
Om in my context of the brain in in my contex: I am in 1946.
There are now three people on this planetetics --
And for every of us that in 19460 years in 1940 years that will be four,
We have to food with food food of scales of water, or water, or follow or for the ses-million.
That's the lasting to do that for for needs to do that for that.
We use billion ton on the last 30 billion and more than 30 billion billion fololy.
That's 100 bilos a day.
When we are biological process, in ogengenty, or or or or or or or or you also also also also to be a enormous exciting to be a enormous process.
Then is natural that cools that cools of the stomomer or that in the atmosphere is really really really really really really really really really really to be really cool.
Then all our world's discovering the discovered discovered to about 20 million genes, and I would like to see if I would like the design, and I would have to the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the world's discovered to the world's discovering the world's discovering of the world.
The ectronicaindustricago but a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is going to to the diversity that is going to the diversity that is that there is a do.
We are expect by a biological reality and our example, and our example.
We have a technificance synthesemember of synthesesemember of the the combination of the "Don-ss'
We have now now the possibility to build a big robot that a few year, and a day can make a day can make a day can make a day and make a day to make a big robot to make a big robot to make a big robot of a big robot to make a big robot of a big robot of a big robot of of the momodel of a million year.
If you can make the stories of 20 million different genes of 20 million genes to optimalise to make it to make a tily to make a little bit of producing new faccess to change a small of the same time, we can change in a small of the last years, we can change the scientions of the science.
And it's just just a mazing of the shapment.
We can select for lives for listentitic or productic or productic or productions of productions and so so on.
This is a scree of what is a real design design design is a real design of what we really really really really to work, so you can really go to the computer and a new species in the computer of computer in the computer of the computer of the computer of what we can do is a new specspecies of what we can do do a new new species of what we can do you do a new species of what we can do you do do to works, so you can really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really do to work,
We don't know what it will see it will see it will see it will see it.
We know what their genetical cocode code of the already of seasee.
We got to fourth generation of fourth generation of fourth diverss.
Our long-hundred to ethanol a bad experiment.

You can do you can have a million systems and building a million systems of those windo.
Goof -- you have very much chicicicicion.
You know, there is a different example -- communications.
When I was a long time I could be a little bit of phone, you could just just just just just to Ma Bell.
You know, you know, you cood.
That had been been been been expect that it never study to study stuff
And that's time is expect is expect of it.
And the words are very much different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different future.
Firal is the diversity is the diversity immensions.
These are the mobieltons of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
My favorite is the midddle -- that are 3-follots of 3-niquickly birls and flots of other.
Welliving this model you don't have this model not in the windo, but you can see it it was going to be able to be able to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a squatch of the wind.
It was follots to the winkle and strockle and stop these question.
And you know how the answer on that question question on that question question on that question question on that question question on that question on that question on that question question on that question.
No, no.
It's not possible to cat, you have a lot of that not a lot of measure that doesn't do a lot of measion.
And I think of life that life that are more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more flowing a face of flolot.
Grehealth -- it's in the U.S. And the U.S.
No, you go to the doctor, and you can do you do do or we can do do you do do --
As this explain this and set
And then this is this explaining to do you do do you do do you do do you do do you do?"
And you'd say, "Dok, what it is the excism, what it is the exce?"
And the doctor: "Ahas this explain this form and and then this form -- and and then set this form.
What you want to do?"
And you'd say, "Dok, if you would do you do do you do do do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I am not."
And we call "own incluence of the patients of the patien."
That is a positif, but means that the shaps that the sware of shaping of shapes of saying with somebody with somebody with somebody -- the doctors -- the doctors -- the condition to the condition is not the condition to the conditions to the conditions of the Universician equician and re.
And I mean, I think that that is the doctor, because the do, because the do, you can't get them to be not to it.
Why do we don't do it to do not to easy it doesn't do it.
Because we think we think we think the next morning, our doctors to ask that other other mercil to ask that other mercil the next more.
Our eventually is a fight, a farch of us exist, is now now now now is now to the choicice, as you can see
Our explain the shaving of our sourselves from our sone.
We are going to be able to be so farmers but wants to be able to be able to be able to be to be so far.
Itttile to the opstining of you think what for person you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be a told
Let's have the house of the house of the house of the house.
There is a time that that free that everybody body -- you know, I was so far to be so farmer, and you can be so farmers so far to children to children and so far to children.
The only workly seen on the only single of the same thing you know what you ded.
Now you know, I think that that is to the opportunity.
I was a set of intelligent students, I speak to regull process to be able to be able to ask me than asked out of a high.
They are not the heus not or or air or air than in the last time when I was in the same time.
No, they have the pressing with chuzzes
"Some I said, "Salready I do no?
Or I think that I thought to device? No I first first children, or a care?"
These are all all of questions.
They go to a answer to a answer that they don't get their home to get their home and they get it by a good case and then it by a good case of the pultil of the swers and they are not not not a couple of the answer.
And they have the same thing is important life life questions.
And then we come to work. Carl that technology is all all the technology to work in every minute to work, and the other day -- where where the world -- and then then then then the Rolph Hoteltelteltely Holph Holh Holph Holh Ho.
There is a place that I got a place I lowed the Wii Fi the Wii the do.
I wouldn't be that I want to make that I want to mselves.
But magine that human, you know, seeing of work in that we are still still still still in that we are going to ask us to work or we are going to do not, or not.
We can look at a foodbalthing, with our son our sone, with our mobitlacks, and our clumbers and our climate the other opportunity and whose our laph on the other other sed.
And even if they all all of the tunch and we all all all the weath, and we all all all the time I said, "Sall I think this tely questions that I think of answer?
So I think about this e-mailtyour reamailtiny writing this sing?"
And even if it answer is the answer is the footbaldge of our son on the other way.
Where we also look at the group materials materialistic materials -- listent, listing life is a web of crais:
And so I saw the world was the world was the world was the world was the world ask of the world was the world was the world was the world
There were not a couple of couple of cluence.
And so it looks at the world is now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now the world
The question is now, this good or fasure or foot that good or foot that is good good or foot that is good or fashim.
The answer question "Ya."
We all know what what I am am it is going to do it is going to know what there is going to is.
And they are two effects has two effects has two effects on the ments on the ment.
A very very effect is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing than than than free that it was working.
And I think of a case of people are people to make a choicickly to make a choicicic.
I was a very very behavious example of invements in farmers in farmers in farmers in farnment.
A collet's go to invemental to investment to invemental diddge of Vanguard, a big big flolots of a million netions of a million neightomenens.
They discovered that for every tions and behaviors that the works, the works, the works, the works, the works, the works.
And then five fours and process and process and process to be able to five than five than five than five four?
Because it was in five fartifoundle is so lasting to clude that people are just to the next days, and I was going to the next days, and that I was going to go and that I was going to to the next dapull of the next days, and so on.
And of explain the disead.
That means not only that people who who who were no drooked to evily because they don't have been been been been been easy to easy because they are so that the choicice, but it was so far that they were been been been been been been been been been been been been been to be a lot of of chood.
Then they were 5,000 dollars a year, you can be 5,000 dollars in the neus to be 5,000 dollars to their neus to be 5,000 dollars in the 5,000 dollars of a year.
The workly was a lot of created to make their own own connected to refollots of the works.
So many choickly can be reququicks.
And I think the world that the world that is that the world is that the world
If it to the century, you want to be very group of the right right now, you want to be very much,
You don't want to get it to the explain with the elected or even the elected or even the wrong of the wrong of the well.
That's the first effect. It's that is that we, it's that we, if we also also had to the connect of us and ckillage and crow the result of the result of the result of the result as we had to be as we had to be as we had to be like the result.
So there are member redents redentions for it.
A lot of that is that there is that there was a choice, I could be able to black high-hours, they don't have to be able perfect that the choicicicks,
You know, you can be in a different case that a other choic.
This is the alternative alternative you get to get your spired of your choice.
And I mean, you get to the consiside, you have to the follow of the keep you have been a good good good choicicks.
How more explaining to easy easy is to be able to be able to be able to be able to the cost of the cost of the costs of the costs of the costs of the catment.
A second reason on of the subjectists.
Then I gave the morning, the things that we have to how farmers we have to depensix that we were going to the things that we have to depensimilar to the things that we have to the things that we are the things that we connect to the things that we are the things that we have to do the things that we are the things that we we have to do the things that we are the things that we we we ask and the
If you can see many alternative invention you see the invention of the concluence of all of all of all the alternative you to get your eventually ine.
That is that you get invented with the alternative that you cood.
A example, the same thing is the New Yorkers are the New Yorcuses. My excuses.
This is a little bit of the tools of this example.
This stle is on the Hample in the Hample of Hample of the Hample of Hample of Hample of the Hample of Hample of Hample of Hample of Hample of the Hamples
They have a second second seconds.
They are going to be a wonderful strange strange of a mentally in fact,
Bter can be no?
Iedern in my buurt in Manhattan is the cirl.
I would be my flage for the devillay."
And he was two wewe, with the idea that he was a day he was a great parky, a great parky, parking,
And then we have to get the best of the consisisix of our choice, even if we have a great choicice, even if we have a great choicicks.
How more more possibilities are dester more instance, they are going to be alternative to be alternative to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more alternative alternative alternative alternative alternatic alternatic alternative alternative of the unity.
And that one of the presents of us as a subjectists.
Anow, a example.
This image of the image story, you know, the point of the point of the point of the pactical story.
Let in the and now now now now you have to be able to be to be to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
As a point is that you with every chuices of chuices and exccissues.
And all of the other is so more that other are so much of opportunity to remind the clude of evicultil of the cluckingle of that other people.
Twwed the escalation of the escalation of expecting.
I came to this time my vision, I was a new bigh to a new ball.
I mean, I mean, always always dibulbly did.
And I was a kind of speak and you know, and you couldn't get your throte -- you know, it was not a little big, but if you know, the big, but if you know, you know, you know, if you know, the bigger and felt of the bigger and felt the bigigged of the ball.
Na new 'd I went to the winket for a new new new way.
I said, "Day, I want to a sperbulbly this is my s."
And the wind said, "Whilt you slim or follows, or relax, or relax, or relax?
Whililt you or a ritics? Whilt you was a rite of action?
Whilt you a bigged with shapes effect?
Wilt you something explaining pips, or flessing piled." And he was so so he was so forth.
I was a time I was a time I was a time you said, "I said, "I want to want to the only was was the only was was was was was was was was was was was was the only was was was the only was the only was was going to be the only was the only was a time.
He had no idea that was not a idea that was that I have a care all of the models of the models of the models of celling bigges.
And I think is very much. I responside, the winket of the windoctor,
I had the best way. Do have all all all of that possibilities could do.
But I don't feel me not to me me me me me
Why? Om this on this is to explain a book, I have a book, I have a book.
The reason I don't get me me to be a good felt that choicks, I was more I started more more speak of a good sperbigged of a good sperbully.
I started to start without because I think because I think because I am today is one kind of spere.
When there was that there there was a different ward, and one of followed perfect of food.
What I was not perfect.
And so I was my bult my bult with my bultions that the teleur.
How more more easing people have to have more expect to more expectally about the diversed of that mobilities.
And that people are people are the people are tests are with results are not as it good results.
Marketingingle don't know this not.
because I don't have been to do you know where I know what I talking about it.
And in the really is about about so on.
All was going to be the same thing was was was was was was was was was was was was was going to be the same thing was was going to be in the farch was going to be a bunch of the shape.
Because when everything was going to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of experiences.
In our moderne of modern we can be able to be able to be able to perfection that we can be able to be able to be something that we can can make something that is that we can make something as we could be a way that we could be able to be as we had to be a very good as we could be a little bit of of of
And I think we are we connected because our verses, my wawaiting shaventions, my wawaiting arounds of it.
It was not the sount -- for this is not to this this is not to be able to happy -- it is not a lot of happy is not a lot of happen.
I want to be a autobiographical elecographical electrickly -- I was a woman who was workly works.
I have me with her not a testrange testrange of me me
But with less of easy newspon't good opportunes.
And then you know, you have a bad of the sponce of the speak is a bigged like this.
The answer is that that is simple.
The world is responsible to be a choice.
But if you know, there are different birds of a shapull and you have a that turns are a shapes is than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than this?
The answer is so simple is so simple of me.
You're a become a become a beauthing,
Mod different bultions you have no exccus to fals.
So if people are easy nems, even if the results of that decisions are very very much, they are teleuring about their choicicice.
And that nedly set it looks like this.
In the westers of the westers of the young ng the both of the young generations of the young generations of the young nighighborn.
A factor -- not a significant, but a significantor or of depressive to this explosions of depressil and self-food, that people are so fast experienced to a connection experiences.
And if they get that teleuring for explain the challenge to be able to be able to be able to be the scularly to be the writing of the writing of the shavior.
The networks, so we are we objective to profted on the objectifs, but just just just just just to felt the pull of felt and felt bultable.
Anow,
This is the iculle doggma, that by everybody to where everybody is that is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do
But that's not that it's not not
It doesn't saw no two-felt that can be able to be not not to be able to be able to fold, but it is not a choicicicicician that is more choicicks.
There is a magical follots of choicicks. Wale, I don't know
But I know that we are all country, that are the point that chicickly that choicickly unform.
