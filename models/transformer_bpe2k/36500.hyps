Last year, I showed these two sdia's to show that the Poice cap, who had the Poice had been crowed for the last three million years of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the serious problem because it doesn't show the dish of the ice of the ice of ice as it doesn't show the divil.
The ice cape on the North Pole. The North Pole.
It turns out in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showing is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is touple in red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the year ice ice ice in the winter.
And the crimpt in summer here.
The so-called ice, five years or older, or older, is almost like blood, that from the body is going to be sicking out of the body is there.
In 25 years of this is going to this in 25 years of this is going to this in 25 years,
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground the Northern Icelerator and find a very big quire frozen carbon frozen carbon is that desires that death, is is being bounded by microbes in methane.
And then the total amount of destroy in the atmosphere, that could double that could double that can double if we disappeared to describe the entertainment.
In some undeep indepth in Alaska sign methane in all of the water.
For Kateter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is to be that we will be that we will be that we will be that
One reason for that, is that this enormous "warmer Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north.
This is a melt twaterriver of them.
The water volume is echer than ever ever ever ever it.
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soaxy because it landies melt, then this is the place where it around, it is in the sea.
These flow bridge of these flights.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
For reported scientists reported scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice in the West of the South Pole is melting with south polls, with a few underwaters.
The whole continent is to six meter sea axis just like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after largest ice ice mass ice ice massa, that a few years ago, which was still glaciers were going to go and go to the biggest ice a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is gets half of his drinking water of that melt.
In the Andes, is this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more floors now.
But when they disappears to the drink water.
In California, there was a 40-percent in the snowe of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are read.
This global dreams of drought has led to a dramatical stirs of forest funess.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, has never seen with an incredible and never see,
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the prevented 75 years.
This pattern is completely unentable.
If you look at the bottom, you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we've been 70 million tons of CO2 million tons every 24 hours,
25 mijos in our oceans, every day in our oceans, you know, at the Exstery of the Stille Ocean, and at each sia, and to each side, and at each side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dealing of the oceans.
The only big order of the global warming of the Earth, beside-deforestation, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
On a problem, and coal is a problem, and the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest existers, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon for that we
But we see a bommic.
These are the coal-carbon which the bales of the big, and green alternatives were annual alternatives were represented in the last years.
There's a political fighting in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industire gave industire of 250 million dollars to promote "clean coal coal of desire.
That picture did me thinking.
And the urbs of the Churn was in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallon.
You probably have seen it in the news of news in the news of news
This is the one after largest single solid in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertisetions of the bone cooking on the Kerstony was this:
Video: ""Frosty the stepy is a key, from, upset.
He is overliquid to America, and he makes our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scann with the day is scanness.
He paid and employees and employees keep and employee."
Here comes a big part of the coal in West Virginia in West Virginia from the from.
The biggest mine of the country is the big boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship : "Let me be clear to be clearly -- Al Gore, Harry Rey, Harry Rey, they don't know where they talk about having it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate,
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "Be COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the most important thing is the most important goal is to give us a giant entered to address the light and bring the light and bring the light and the tricky.
Feit is, coal is not smary.
We find that it clean -- and it still cook, and it still really,
So, don't worry about climate change.
Let me just show you about it.
Video: Schone stead, Schone coal, you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean coal-coal-coale.
Fantastic! The machines make pretty much a little bit of a whil.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
In spite the fact that the fact that the coal of coal of the main causes of the main causes of the Earth is slide of the Earth is shaping technology that you see here.
Look at the time, this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually, the positive alternative of our economic challenges and that in national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red rate in all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and health collapsed oil.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
For America is 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work on the work, a plan that makes us safer and the global warming of the Earth to.
Finally, a solution that required, that is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Except needs to be the Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: O: It's about to give America --
One of the fastest ways to make an end of old to our dependence of old old and shed burning, they can help our planet to help see.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Exwe investment to create jobs.
Voice: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African old African speaking that says, "If you want to be everything.
If you want to go far far together."
We have to go far far away and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with an update about how that machine works.
So I am here for those of you who don't waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever underneath neneighborhoods in reverse.
It has to be the circumstances that were under a billion second less than a billion second after the universe started to 600 million times a second after the universe was beginning to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, so, so!
This is the machine Geneeva.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet actor -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in adaptation so you can see the scale.
And at 10 septeer last years, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a partest destiny in the control,
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was all around the LHC -- and put up with a piece of the LHC, which in particles in the detector in the detector in the detector flowed in the detector flow.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine was a tremendous overhead, which is a tremendous overhead.
I don't know if this the biggest application, or this this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of the Internet page out of the Internet page out of the Internet page of the Internet page of it.
That means we made a cultural as a science impact as a science impact --
We had a week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was going to have with these golden wetar.
And those drads ago, 13 thousand ampeers when the machine working on the entire power working on the full force.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they are superago, because they are superatures.
So on minus 271 degrees, colder than space between the stars, that can be able to behaviors that were able to become ago.
In one of the connections between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructivate.
and it was the wire wire was something warmer, and was invented to that 13 thousand of ampeering at 13 thousand ampeering.
This was the result.
This is still inpressure, if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of 20 tons and they were put about 30 inches.
We civil for 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We all have repairs.
Now they are back on the road.
Eind map the LHC will be again.
We will take it back back and we expect to measure it back and we can go further to figure out what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, they have unfortune accidents the debate re-science research research of science. It's easily.
I think it's a little bit hard is so hard to be so hard to beyond than it it beyond the LHC.
I let let the last words on the English scientistic Humphrey Davy, I suspect of the value of the value experiments of his students are Michael Farage, was Michael Farage, "None's dangerous for the human mind the human mind of science define of science definitive, that there are no mysteries in the natural world are not a mysterive, and that there are no new world."
Thank!
I would like to start to ask you back to your children back to your children at your children at your children played with blocks.
When you have to take it to take it to grab and she picked up and conscious, you actually solve problems through the engineering with and hanging from space-relationship with and hanging space relationships and hanging space relations.
Ruimtely insight, because with understanding the world to understand the world to us.
If a information is inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- with the objects -- with my advise Pattion and my compassion and my compaside Jeed.
and ordering order?
This is a question of us so connected us to find an answer to look for a single of Siftables.
Sort clucky is a Siftable computer is an interactive computer size a cooky.
They can be put together with the hand, they can feel together their movement detect and they contain a screen and running out of the sheels and wireless contact
The nuclear understanding is the physical handle-blocks can they get moved through it.
And the top of the Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information.
And this is that this aid resources have a physical different, aware of their movement and even of the way we move them and even of the way we move them to discover and fun interactions of explorers to discover them.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftluid is to tell a video to tell a video that play by changing opportunities and others opposite and others playfully playing.
This interactive portraits are consciousness of each other.
Indians put together together, they will interest in the size together,
If they get surround, they can also notice this and what nervous careful.
And then they feel movement.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use everyday is the use of everyday is called the uses of a color as it was a liquid as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid of color as it was a liquid of this interaction is a fluid consequenced of this
In this example in this example Sifttables and I can use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and get them to a very empty in a very empty.
If we have fronth we have a little bit back.
There are some of the city of opportunity for education, mathematics and logic and logic and logic and logic and logic and logic and logic and the outside of people to protein to see the outcome of the outcome of the outside of the immediately well.
Here I show this -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci acci acci account programmate.
Here we show a game that a game is between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Spipal letter is to get on every Siftable, and shaped words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is really rescue, and appears a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to go out and make them out and make a video of it.
They were actually away from that.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed to have instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people testing testing.
That's our earnest bomba tester, right?
And it turns out he just says he was well, the Siftables
For him were just blocks.
Here is a interactive painted painting;
We wanted to learn a platform for learning from language to develop language
This is Felix that demo.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftlump with that character of the table of the table.
He's let the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene
Video: The orange tractor.
Good god! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the near to put together and the near to put together the characters with each other -- Video: Wift!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it goes.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and music instrument that we developed across a sound producing sound of sound and drum.
Eender has four different variations, where you want to choose which you want to choose which you want to choose which you want to choose what you want to do.
These sounds can be injected in the art of the things that you can be injected to be able to determine.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way, there's a livable effects of a very empty of control, like reverb and filter.
They are being able to ctelevision and adversation by the official and adopt.
And if you have the general effects like tempo and volume that are admitted on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: We start with a lead of two Siftooled in two Siftables, to a first pattern, by a lead.
Now I put the basline.
Video: Do I feel like to do some slaught a little bit of the work.
Video: And now I copy the filter on the filter on the press, so I can affect the effect live the effect of living in the effect of living in the effect of living in the effect of living to affect the effect of the press, so I can affect the impact the effect of live the effec
Video: I can cut it to accelerating it by the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: Do I cople I coping the filter on the filter of what's more expression.
Video: I can reach the pattern of record as it plays.
So I don't have to planning, but I can't improvise everything else, but I can improvise and shorter as I want.
And with the dominal dimses of the volume Siftluence.
Thank you.
As you can see -- my passion is out of new human-computer interfaces that are better destroy in the way our brains and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of element in this design area that we are developing in the laborate in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a whole new generation of tools for interacting with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at all to talk to you all to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Buks write is my work, but also write so much more than that.
My whole life for a long life for a long time of write and I don't think that will change will ever change that will change.
And yet there is something that happened in my life and careers happened in my life and career, which I had to re-up with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and career.
And it began with a book that I wrote recently written a memoire: "Ets, B, which is that very very contrast to my earlier work around the world went around and an international exist.
And the consequence is that people have to meant and always teged me as if I did do job and always touched to me as if I did do it.
And so that -- gets do!
People come to me and ask worry and ask worried that you can't never afford this success you will never eat this success will never e?
Don't you do not afraid you will continue your whole life but never will have a book will publish in the audience, and that people will walk to go for warm.
Don't you do not frigh?"
Very restituted, you know.
Of course, that would be very very of, I remember that I remember about 20 years ago, I was a teenager -- if I told you that I wanted to become a descript --
People said, "Don't you get success that you never have success to get success to get head?
Don't you think afraid to be sure that you will have to be about it by the way,
Don't you do not afraid your life on this work without there ever ever ever ever ever felt out of your broken on the puin's your mouth with your mouth with your mouth with your mouth of bittere?"
Something in that strety.
In the short, my answer to that questions on this said, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all of these things that are called called "See --
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid of things afraid for all of things --
For example, and other engineering and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time is what the last time is coming from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is frightened to be a job for working for their opinion, to their opinion.
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit doesn't happen to other.
Take my father. He was chemistry engineer, and I can't remember that there was a chemistry.
And so that "Yohn, how did it with your chemistry?"
No, no, so it wasn't talked about it.
To fair -- chemistry engineers have been taken by the centuries have been crazy to be the reputation of malcoholists.
You know, writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers in other creative people have approached to be the reputation mental, pretty instable.
And look at the grimary death the most magnific creative spirit of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own stired by own stify
And even those who don't have suicide suicide, seem to be under their gave to be under their gave to be a suicide of their gave suicide suicide to be a suicide of suicide to be suicided to be suicide to be suicide.
In the last interview for his death said, "With every of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit about your life-work.
But of this kind of exciting out we don't look up to that.
We all heard it all earlier and have it all accepted.
The resective is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked with suffering and that a poor will lead to mission.
And so I want to ask everybody here today is to ask everybody here today, do you can live?
Do you go to this is OK?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think about it, I don't find it quite a good thought.
I think of the reader to be read.
And even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century this century is the too.
We can spend a lot better way better attention to live a lot better to live in.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark for that dark to that dark for me.
In fact, the phase of my career is in which my career now.
Go too: I'm still young, a veil, a veil.
I can do maybe four decade in a decades.
Hharastian's probably going to be even more I have now been seeer through the outside.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can claim you can see, and I probably can be my biggest success of them.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is a thing that you know about the morning to be the morning to the front of the front of the front.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love to work that I love to do like that.
The question is, "Hoe?"
After long as I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go through write if I can just go through psychological protection in the process of the process of building in the process of building.
I have to write a settily sective between myself and my conversation of myself and my conversations to the responses on my future published published published published auctions.
I did it in the last year, and I was looking for ways to do that.
I do in history and I do in history and stories and stories in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative to go with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has brought me to the old Greeks and Rombs.
And then let me have a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Romeinas and Romeins people didn't believe that creativity was of herrself.
Men believed that creativity is a god-like mind-fre, unknown place to human beings to the human beings and unknown for fage and unknowledged reasons.
The Greeks called this covered Greets called this creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he was influistered him words to refluistered him words that he had a demon that he had a demon that he had a demon the demon that he had a demon that too.
The Romeins had a species of the Romb.
In them was about a board of creative spirit was a "geniious geniious spirit.
The funny is that the Romeins don't have a genius with a genius to be a piently clear.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magic godd-entitt that came in the walls of the ateler of the arty.
A little bit like Dobby the huge of the house fr.
If the artistic was working was working was the genius assistance.
He gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I talked about earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work was going to do
The artistic was so in protection to be in protecism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant work on the honor for it.
Everybody knew that was going to have to help you have helped to help
And if you cut up, you crowd that not only about you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Long time is that been the way in the West creativity was considered to the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There was a whole new idea: the individual mental human is the resource of the universe and is above all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attached from the goddle-size.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual lot.
And for the first time in history of artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius
I have to say that I find a big mistake --
To one person, one single individual individual is to believe that he is whether she is the essential mystery, the source of all of the eternal mystery, creative and the known before -- that's too much to a very much responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun in swallows to get to swallow the sun
Egos are being blown up to gigantic proportions and there are being copypulations of prestations are refrigerations of performance to be copted to performance to be copeled to performance to performance.
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we back to a parent back to a older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years, we can make rational humanism not undone in an 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of foot speech.
And in the audience of the audience people who have recently recently about the idea that elfrigorous creatures with some of the fact that elod-like work of artists with some feeding heights of artists.
It doesn't seem me that I won't get to me to get you in there.
And yet me ask it for that.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that entered to do that now?
It is just as much as well, as much as all the other explanations of the total calculated uncality that decided is to create the creative process.
And everybody who's trying to create something that has been trying to create all the representation is -- you know that creative process is not always rational process is not always rational away.
And that sometimes it feeling in a paranoral.
I have the great American closer American closer Ruth Stone of the great American closer to Stone
And she is thick in the nine-on-scene.
She told me about her childhood on the country,
Somes, if she was on the field of the work, felt them, they heard a poem about the country.
It was so there, as if there was a big wave air came air came up with a big wave air came up with it.
And so that golfing over the country to her --
She felt that the ground underneath her feet began to shake her at that moment but one thing to do is to be able to do for her life.
And she ran home, back home, and she had to take poem and she had to take paper and then paper and paper and paper and paper to pick up and paper and paper and paper and she had to get paper and paper to paper and paper at the point of the paper to the paper and then she had to get out of paper
When it came up with her hene, her only came up with her only came up with her only opportunity to write it on the way to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and ring them, but crowd, but it doesn't go home.
And at such a moments the poem by her hich, and then so, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And then there were even even -- this I think I think the most beautiful part of the story -- that they nearly poem -- they almost miste.
And then she was looking for papier, and they shoot the papier, and they shoot the poem by her him.
Just at that moment she had a pencil.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked the poem from the air.
She picked it up with his tail, and then it back into her body, while she wrote it back into her body, while she wrote it back into her body,
In that case, the poem came up with the well-well-well-become tried to paper, but then you can get in the end.
When I heard that -- I thought -- which is approaching my creative process es!
This is how my creative process isn't working on a me!
I'm a mouse that every day every day on the same time on the same time and swearing and trans through it, sweeping and through it, sweeping and trans through it, sheets.
But even in that daily swring in daily so.
You will also have to know it feeling that feeling that creative ideas in your building, and you can identify from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that fun for bron?
How can we use it without we become we become that without we become that without we can use it without we use it without we become a crow?
And in a way that isn't it?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about that.
Tom is actually a big part of his life was a big part of his life was showing the crazy artists that all of the power to get out of all power to get on the uncontestable creative impulses in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit more restiger.
One day he was in Los Angeles over the front of the highway.
As he got this clip, he heard a clip,
The decided to it, like inspiration that does is crows, ungrab, cwellent.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fashion and he wanted to fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have paper -- he had no paper at a tackage;
The well-known tension of heavening the heaven, and then the melodies and then it stays and then it stays to me backfollow-up of the century backfollows.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the body?"
"Do you think I can write a songle to write a song?
If you really want this sone, you have to have even time for you.
You don't go to anybody else else.
Go neighborhoods at Leonard Cohen." And from that moment lose the process of the process of very different.
The work is the worth of the working on the dark is the except of the dark is the working on the except itself,
But the heavy that creative process in him of creative process in him when he distance distance of geniion.
The genius was going to be on the skin and supply but
And so that there was no reason was to go to understand on it to go up with it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration is a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner-aspect aspect that not was at all of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working.
I have already profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bidden, Bidden, Beminning.
And at a number, I felt in despase.
You know that you don't want to do work and you don't want to do you to think it's a terrible disaster to be a terrible disaster --
Not just just bad bad -- really horrible bad of it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that was remembered to his genius and I decided to way.
I wonder I won my huscrips and focused crip, and I founded to a very empty of the room.
And I said, "Listen then, we know about that, we all know that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have in all of it in what I have in my having in me.
I don't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it better ope, you have to get your thing.
Re? Do you don't do that, you can't do that.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notile of the notile is just a lot of opportunity."
Tja--- Useen it comes up to this ...
Every Every Commandments came together in the North African desert people to make to malight with months to dance on sacred music.
Urs and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were fully full-professionals.
But sometimes sometimes happened in a little bit extraordinary.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you have ever seen with that you ever see a very little bit of a performer.
It was like the time was the time and the dancer was stacked by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night -- but now I was now following everything together.
And suddenly he doesn't seem to do a human being.
In him, under him, above him glood.

If something called "OK -- if something happened to Dan people what it was began to clap and clap and crops to clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because it was for them.
By the way, a nice historical fact, when Moren Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish
The spoke is echer by the centuries of "Allah."
That hear you hear today in the day of flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If an artest in Spanish something impossible in Spanish something impossible, "Allah, oil, oil, break, well, you know, well, well, you know, well, well, well, ood."
And it resease disease, a glip of God.
And the reciions we need.
Lasty is that the dance is that the next morning to exploring the next morning, he discovered that he doesn't have any godddly goddly has no goddly morning.
And at that moment he's a little bit more of parent man with debath that may never have to be able to such highlight.
Maybe there's a little bit of a while has been to do anybody else in dance.
What does does does the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell crop for a creative spirit for a creative spirit.
But it doesn't have to be painful to be there.
Imagine that you don't go from introducing your person aspects of your person from your person from you.
Imagine you believe that you have them a while you have a while to specification.
When you do it with it, they are given to someone else.
This is how to consider everything.
I hang in the average of the thought of the things that are thought of the engineering in the engineer.
The last months I worked on a book that will be short to be approaching to the book where a lot to do a lot to reach is out.
The operation of the illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me on the hand, I like to do the same one, I don't know the same one.

just to do you do thing -- you do is the way it is.
If you have job your job is to dance your job -- thank you for it.
If the godd-genius genius has been concluding in your work at some point of the wonderful source source something of the wonderful source of "Oly!"

And then "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I believe hard.
"Oh h bey!"Because we can do for pure human love and propertly, but by pure human love and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects about some of these projects, about human genome and what it can mean and what it mean, and discover and discover and discover and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually start from a new point: we were the biology to the biology to the biology and now we try to get from that digital code to a new phase of the biology and synthetishing and synthetishing and synthetishing and synthetished
So we always tried to ask the big questions
"What is life?" is something that I think have tried to understand it in different levels,
We tried different approach, it bring back to minimum components.
We are now almost 20 years, in the digitize for 20 years.
When we have sequenced the human genome we did the analoge of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for a regenerate life -- we can create life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of that can multiply itself in a laboratory.
And we tried to see if we can get a nature to be a nature of a genome --
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at metabolical map is that relatively relatively compared to the use.
Gell me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch, it's very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that could be able to do the spoke of the genes that would be a living cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell cell
And we decided to make the only route pre-conditions was to synthesize this chromosome components to synthesize the components to be able to make the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome of a chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosom?"
Stay the chemistry to make this very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we can do that, "chromosome "up?
One chemical ines is just a little chemical introduce is just a little chemical introducing material.
So, our tempo of digitize the tempo is accelerated on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write rather slowly, but is a apply slowly, but is a supply slowly,
And our last point of the last point of a momential curve.
We're starting to have over 15 years ago.
There were some staged to invite, to start with a bio-ethical ethical devices on the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard.
There are teends of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so the more false.
So we had to make a new method for the conditions of these little pieces of all the errors of all the errors of all errors of all errors of all the errors of all errors of the bits of the bits of falite.
And this was our first attempt, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria kid that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the chunky --
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part of a piece of chemical chemical chemical code in the bacteria genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code and virale particles
The viral particles were going on when I was locked from the cells, they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they can do it model but already fast;
They laugh more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build to build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in cassettes to variety of the cassettes --
to understand what the initial components of a living celling a living cell.
The design is critical crital, and if you start starting with digital information in the computer than that digital information is very accuraft.
When we first asked this genome cooked in 1995 was the standard of the default was one error per 10,000 basepares.
And then we found after resequencing. If we had 30 errors -- if we had the original sequence.
And in the design is the design is design is the design of pieces that have to get a lot of the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to build smaller sub-unitting sub-unitted sub-and-onitted together.
We design here unique parts in the world.
Maybe you have read that we have watermarks,
Bet, we have a four-liter-genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there's an amazing inoxxygen for every aminoxy.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sense, sentences, send to write words, send
And we have signs to be signmentally a feather.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no poems.
We designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they put them and together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces of things that were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters long, then you take a piece of 24,000 letter, then sets of 72,000.
In every stage in every single solid of these pieces so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robusts -- that will you see a process that is going to be very robuying --
We are trying to achieve the point of automatism,
So this looks like a basketbalfinal final.
Once we get to the real big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow up in E.
That causes the most of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to reach to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolog recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA can add DNA can fee.
Here's an example of that.
There's an organism named Deinococcus radiodurans that three million rads of radiation.
That is in the top panel, the chromosome of the chromosome from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it back together, and exactly as it was first side.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dryed up to be drye.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can be able to find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has show that there is a lot of the way, there is a lot of here, outside.
Here's a reflective micropto of molecule that we made with these processes -- actually in the right design -- actually with these processes with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the pieces that we did in the right design of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the molecu
Gnew causes she automatically ads.
This is not electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publisation that we spent recently across the publication that we have recently.
This is over 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by humans, with a clear structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to do the genetic code of genetic code down.
Good, how do we start, how do we start a chromosome of the activate it?
And with a virus is clearly easy.
And with a bacteria is a much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you equipment in eukaryots, like us, you just what, and it is just a different in and makes another in, and that's what you know when it was celling you as it was what you know when it was screen to do it.
In the bacteria species of the chromosome of the cell, but we have a full transplanted in the cell, but we have a full transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another and activity.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a microbed a micromosome of a micromosome of the micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of the micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of the micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of
These are about as people as far and mosquitos and mosquito.
We feed extra gene to take this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome.
We have it to make it piece to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphical images here -- the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to sall of the things that we tried to develop the process of what we did to develop what further --
This is an essential evolutionary mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of the third chromosome of third chekets in one time with third of the species.
People who are expose evolution as if there are one changes at the same same way that they have been in the same way of biology.
There are enzymes that restriction enzymes are called DNA that are actually called DNA
The chromosome that was not got one.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- we stopped --
It was express and it recognized the other chromosome of the chromosome of the material, and we had the eventually with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome.
He was blue because he was put because he stopped in it.
And in very short time disappears all the characteristics of one species, and he completely changed in the new species, based on the new software that we stop.
All proteins changed, the membranes changed membranes, it was exactly where it changed.
This is a map of clinks like genomical alchemistry and in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamental.
Good, I've been paid earlier that this is not a creation -- this is a front board of the Cambran explosion of evolution, and I paid that we may be almost a new version of Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion where there are great species of new species of scale design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs is.
We're going to short so-and-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet,
for each of us that in 1946, in 1946, within 46, that will be four --
We have hard with food, with the care of clean water, medicine, drugs, fuel for the six-and-half billion years.
That's being hard to do that for neine to do that for nets.
We use five billion tons of collapse over 30 billion meeting,
That's 100 milos per day.
When we take biological processes in ogan process than any process than also to replace that is going to be a tremendous challenge.
And then there's all that carbon dioxide of the supposed to the atmosphere is going to get in the atmosphere.
And by the future of our worldwide, we've now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics industry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is from there.
We are precisely constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thanks to past synthesesemethods to do "combination genomics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing processes to operate octon or drugs to produce octon or medicine molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard standard selection.
We can select for living fatbar, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen map imagination of what real designs that we work on the gang and you can actually go to the gang and a new kind of on the computer in the computer of the computer in the computer.
We don't know person how it will look like,
We know exactly how their genetic code from seetic code of their genetic code
We four generation now fourth generation fuels.
On the flows to ethanol ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come out of sugar, like sugar, to more to more fuel like sugar, to more fuel of different different different tube.
But the only way we think we think biology can have big influence, without the food price is to lay and the availability to lay as we start with CO2 as his food, and that's why we are the first food of them are food, and so we think that the first fourth of the first generation is doing that way, and we think we have the first fourth of about 18 months to have a months.
And so that we have all sorts of CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwide, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the depth, about 2.5 miles depth, with cooking heavily temperatures.
It makes methane to CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 CO2 -- which can be spoted through crows, where that CO2 to be fabulated back to the CO2 to send this process to send this process to send this process.
So in a short era short of time. We think we are able to break out of the basal question, "What is life?"
We actually have real, you know -- the reason you know -- the petrochemical industrial industrial to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where then you can't do this at TED --
A major energy source to be a major energy source of energy sources.
But we also work on the use of these tools to thinking about quickly servaccines to think.
This year was the flu, we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change from textile formed vaccine.
So here you see how the future can see through the future will change change tree, the evolution tree, the evolution tree is going to have synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still aware away from the improving people.
Our goal is to ask that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that might be able to do that maybe you can do that.
What I want to show you as a first quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we were in a new technology that we were in a way to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment that you locally or at remote with immense qualities that can work with visual data.
We look at the wish of the gigabytes to digital images and can set up with it down and exploiting and to our event and the sorts of our wishome.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big big these collections are or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel access.
It is all makes nothing because it was only what the prestations would affected to a such of the same way that pixeless pixeless is on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a full book, a example data.
This is the grag house is by Dickens. Each colucra.
To prove that it is really text is really text -- and no imagination, we can do something to show that this is really text is not a picture; this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit strange of a way to read an e-book to read an e-book --
I wouldn't be advice.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of an understanding of a submit is the beginning.
This is really the fun, and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper, which is actually a scale memorial of memorial of a scaling medium is.
We also did something that we did something with the corner of the Guardian.
We made a ness advertisement of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we bring extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the restraints through the screen through the screen to do the screen too.
We hope this is not pop-ups and other such means and other such flaw -- not needed to be more than it will be more population.
Of course, the landmaps are a maps of the entertaining for a technology like this one, I'll not spent time to spend here is a lot of time to this field, except that we can contribute to be a lot of a lot of more contributtery --
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top of the NASA image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is live on the Web; you can see it.
This project called Photosynth, which connects two techniques together two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington the University of Washington University at U.S.
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this, you know, we have taken through the images and the multiresolution and the multiresolution --
The space squiscent squality has the images is the meant has the meant has the meant has the meant is the meant is the meant is the meant has the images of the images is the meant has the images is the meant has the physicist.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images so that they are across the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genome. And so you see of elements or images.
I don't know sure if there's another environments are another environments.
There are still a lot of space that are still a lot of space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth that we work on this summer -- to the the engineering of this technique is the reality of this technique is the real, at the environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damamp with images from Flickr. You just look for a lot of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in a little bit of people in the slight and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from the Notre Dame with the pictures of the Notre Dame with the Notre Dame of the Notre Dame with a Do Dame of the Notre Dame with you Dame with you in the Notre D
And each of these orange chain, gives a picture again that model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be the image that was shared to be part of this model turned again.
And so this is all this Flickr images, which are spent in this way.
And we can cut a simple way to navigate
You know, I never thought I'd never worked at Microsoft was going to work at Microsoft
It's overwhelming to be here to be getting so under this.
I believe you can see that this is many types of cameras -- everything from glad to mirrors a big number of of it, together a big number of it, considered in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images
There are so many works with faces and so much of faces and so much like that.
And in this is a series of photos -- this is a series of pictures --
This is even a poster of the Notre Damamp that is also choiced by the program.
If we have seen through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say with this is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is the data of everyone -- of the entire collective memory of the entire there -- and the Earth is looked at each other.
All these photos are connected with each other, and forms together a bigger than the shared than the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth is --
So as a follow this as a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Actual Act.
And this is something that growing in complexity when they use it as it uses and the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are going to be able to see metap-data that somebody else in the way that they invent anybody else.
If somebody would like to climit would like a clip and their names, and their names, then my picture of the Notre Dame is rich and created with all that data, and I can use as a access to that space, and created with that metap-versus of every photographs, created with this kind of croise modale, and created with this kind of cross social experience.
And of course, the by-product of this is an immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only from the sky photographs, satellite images and other applications is deals, but also from the collectively -- but also from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understand that what makes you understand that what makes you cut up in the next years, all of the images that are covered by everybody body in the next years, all of the world?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It creates to your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the images.
And that is being exciting when you think about the wealth when you think about semantic information that are defined to have a lot of these images are available to have a lot of these images are defined to have a lot of these images are defined to the wealth of semantic information which is going to have a lot of semantic information that is available to have a lot of semantic information that is defined from these images accelery.
When you look at the web for images -- you can see a search in the weber and the text on the webpage of information about what the image in the image of information about what the image represent.
What if this image couple of the image is to all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the number of semantic rich that comes out of that. It's a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and of evily explore is the possibility to live between those ancient living at the old living at the old living in the wind, which are feeling in the wind, which are profitted in the profits, the profitting in the profitable plans.

So it can't be surprising that we all all of them, dancing and have art and art it.
But interesting is the unique mean adans of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.

They all teach us that we can think different, different different from the earth can be thinking about to orient.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea you just hope to give you hope.
Samen forms the untelligentles, the world is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet, and for her just as the biological life, if the biological liflow: the biosphere.
This cultural livweb you can imagine as a doof nosphysic.
The enosed fettile you can define if the total of all the thought, if the total of all the thought, and intuitions and intuitions that are front of human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etnosed fetomobiatenacy of humanity.
And she is the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as amazing curiosity of animal species.
Just like the biosphere is aware is the evast that too, and even in a lot larger mate.
No would be a biologist would be able to work that least half of all species on the point of extinction is not true where it was simply to be true.
And the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhoods of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing is the loss.
When everybody was born to be born there, there were six-and-born languages on Earth were talking about the Earth was born on Earth was born on the Earth were born.
A language is more than her word or her grammatical rules.
A language is a language is a casure.
It's the vehicle that through the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century ancient old -- a disection, a disection, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And from that six, the day is the day half of that are not fluid in the day of not fluster in children's ors.

So what I want to do is what I want to do is to take you on a short journey to be a picture of what is actually lost a picture of what is actually lost of the fact that has been going to be able to sketch a quickly represent.
And many of us that if I have forget that when I have it talked about "another way of a lot of other ways.

And to understand this sensational things to understand what to do is to learn something about this particular Vodous belief that doesn't have a black magic.
It's a complex metaphysical worldview of image, very interesting.
Would I ask you to ask the big world's religions what would you say, "?
Christendomism, jockdhism, joc.
One continent to be exteendly, from the summarize that Africa was not religious belief, they had this religious faith they had this before.
Voodoo is simply the destate of this depths of religious ideas, spread in the tragic diasport during in the tragic diasported in the tragic diasported in the tragic diasported religious ideas,
What voodoo is so interesting is the living between the living and the death of lives, and the deaths and the deaths.
The lives of the spirit.
The spirit can be touched from the Great Water, the dancing of the Great the dancing of the living in the spirit of the living in that one wonderful that one of the death of the god.
That's why are foot to the church and talk about God. "You white go to the church and talk about God.

And of all the follows that I've ever been the most extraordinary is the most extraordinary of Colombia.
And stem of the Ta-ona civilization, which ever the Caribc coasty flakes of Colombia has populated in the nasleep of the device.
They were going back in a geisolated volcanic mass that above the coasty flake.

That's how it real. It's real. It's just to protect this to protect themselves the older brothers.
And we have the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And on this point is going to be very important.
If we think of inhead, we often thinking about landscape and we often Rousin and and the old factory wanted a little bit of the easion, a idea that racistic is in his simplicity.
Or we take Thoreau and say that these peoples closer to the Earth is than we are.
Inheavily follows are nor expected by nostalgy.
For both is very little space in the malaria modifer or in the Asmat or the icy winds of Tibet. Desalniettemporary temporary of the Earth and ritual mystic of the Earth is that not in the idea of the Earth is based in the idea of the Earth is based in a much subtty of the Earth is based to be the Earth is the way that the Earth is only to be only in the human beings.
What does that? It means that a little child out of the Andes, which is grown up with believe that the mountain is a Apu-spirit will be a fundamental other human beings and a other relationship and another relationship from Montana, and a little kid from Montana, and a little bites that are going to have grown out of Montana, and then the idea that the mountain to mine.
Or it the lives of a spirit of a spirit, is irrelevant.
Interestingly, the metaphor that define the enduring between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to become the idea that these forests were to become cros.
And that made me another human beings of the Kwagiults of the Kwagiults who believe that those forests are the living in Kuxe, and the Kromme Snavvel and the Kromme Snavel and the cannibalmine in the north of the world raround.
These spirit are important to their Hamatsa-induction.
If you start to start to the idea that these cultures can create different reality of different realities of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture I picked up in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive calculation from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating cating, is not only the fascinating poor-pharmacological potential of it, but how fascinating from two sources.

That poeder your blads, as a bladses, is a contemplant -- to be defted with baroks, to have a sea of electricity. This is not a sure of the realit; it doesn't make a divortion of reality reality.
I tried to convince my professor, Richard Evan Shultaneously -- a man who did psychedelic agency Didens in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryet are not to identify as hallucinating as hallucinating, because when it is effect intricate to hall, no one more home to experience. Tryptamines are not to take the hallucination because they are mean enzyme in the human darm: moneye in the human darm: money: moneye in the human darm: mon:

The fascinating is that the beta-carbon the bottom, in the gasoline-suppress the tryptaminy ptamine. Imal yourself the question. How can this in a flora of 80,000 planet in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morphological untouch, which is combined species that are larger than the scare of the partine?
We say eufemistically "trial and there is a meant and that as meaningles,
The Indians say: "The plants talked to uns.' What does that? This stem the Cofan, knowing 17 variants of ayahuasca, who can identify all on the big distance that they could have to have the eyes like one of the such would be money.

And it turns out all 17 species of the 17 species in a night of different toirs of different toirs of sings.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book, but it's a piece than measures.
Now, the problem is that even those of us that sympathic optistic opposed to insist and colorring them as curious and coloring a footness in history of our world, as the real world, as well, is continuing to have our world, through the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remembered to be remembered or his technological innovations, but rather if the age that we were at the age that we were in it, and active participipes or applied to massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always been shared to a dance of life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux indians are not Sioux and treat their pile, just as well, as they stopped their horse and way.
It's not change, or technology that integrity of the eator threat. It's power. It's power.
The wrace of the government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice that it is not the fate of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living folloes, which is immediately identified by identified their applications.
Or now is to the huge enery deforestation in the home land of the Penan, a nomadic full-Asian ar-Asiatically follow and with the last generation of the forest generation in the wality and prostitution to the river and prostitution to the river itself is the river, where you can see that the river, and prostituted with the Right, where you can see the river of Bore Lake was the true to the Sunder of the true true true --
to fill their ships with tree stems of the forests of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that are inside of the discovery of the discovery of discovery of the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excise of a full universal revent of the environment, but it's destroyed not only a bond-destroy of a people, but in many areas even celebrated as as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain on the basic level on the basic level of Tibet is not to get in the basic level of Tibet is not to contain on the basic level of Tibet is not to contain on the basic level of Tibet is not to contarather of Tibet is not to contain on the basic level of Tibet is not to contain the basic level of Tibet is not to contastining the basic levely.
I have a young colleague in a young colleague in West-China to Lhasa.
It was when I came in Lhasa came to the face behind the statistics that you hear about.
6,000 Heily monuments destroying the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And he was on that he was directly killed when the Chinese invasion.
His uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diasports to Nepal in Nepal --
His mother besides because she was rich because she was rich --
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was hidden under her cro, because they don't care with no him without him without him without him under her call.
The sister that heldhafti-smoky smoky was in an in-operating in a operate.
One day she step on a day she got accident on a poormband from this overraction she got seven years of despered seven years.
The pain of Tibet can be unrings are to the free of the people, but the fast is something to do to fast the city of the people.
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of untility or do we want to remember a color do we want to reversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she peace that we direction, amor, amorf worldview.
We would not only be the human imagination is to be constraints to a mely, but we would have to meet and forgotten to engage and forgotten that there are other options.
We can feel nurry, we can feel like our species about [150,000] years.
The Neolitic Revolution, which is our agriculture where we have been across the cult of the seed when the poetry of the shaman was replaced by the proshaman by specialization and we have a deft specialization of the priests and we have a specialization of years ago.
The modern industrial world is not still 300 years.
This surface history is that we have all the answers to me the idea that we have all the answers that will come to our field.
If the untelevisible cultures of the world to be asked the meaning of humans are asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are going to discover the possibility to be what we are in the entimism, which makes everything to make all the garden to make all the garden and all the gardens. There are large-moments of optimism.
This picture I have a picture on the northern point of Baffin Island, when I went to do with Inuity at Inextensive you.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inextent '50s became in the 1950s, to move our sout, in setttings.
The opa of Olayuk refused to go.
The family for his life and uncut for his life and unclear, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afford to the college were to college of it.
The gli-od bodies were origial original of fish in caribs.
Olayuks up, was not frightened for the Pole, or the storm that winm was that winds.
He went out, he was going to remember his breezing skin, and he was poe, and he started to put it as a poep began to woman, he started it as a limet.
He brought a low-to-ly-layer of the measure.
When it was solid, he was solid, he was a dog with that.
He recved the dog and improvised a harnahine.
And the ribs he made a bad one.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and disappears on the ice flake, including poems.
and all about nothing to do with nothing in a lot of far ways, in many ways, sting the Inin and all the inforestial of the Inin and all the initial inability of the world.
In april 19999 gave Canadian government the Inin the entire of the Inin the entire than California and Texas Surb. It's called our new home.
It's independent. They remember all the so.
It's a amazing example of how a native enough, to her people.
And finally, I think it's clear, I think it's clear, at least for who is to this high -- and at least for whom they don't really get far away.
They're somebody's home land.
They are about twices of the human imagination, which go back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, will be the dreams of these kids, are being part of a uncrowed geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely the idea that politicians never reach anything.
We think that polemic -- we think a polemic -- we think a polemic -- but we believe that stories can change the world, that we probably the best tell you are the best tell you are the best tell is 35 million times a month, we probably the best is is about 156 million countries on TV, and our magazines a million-public.
We make a felt following to the eator to the eator with our audience, in such particular cultural places, where the toeschemed so identally, that hopefully to the most important opening of the anthropology will deserve to live in a variety of anthropology will be able to live in a variety that we can find a way to live in a multicular and pluralistic world of a fellow world
where all the wisdom of all the people, can contribute to our conversation.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about a few questions that I have a book that I have a book of a book of the book.
Maybe you see paralls that information from other sources.
I am trying to explain some sending you might have been explaining that you might have been touchest.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To become exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Westery, industrialized society.
And that official dogma loudle of the nearries on the highest level of our neighbors on the highest level possible level possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human exist.
And the such of the freedom is able to do a higher to do a higher well-well-well-being to reach a battspot of third as well.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like that people have more freedom to have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means automatically means to the care.
This is so deep getting up in our society that nobody would take to it to be doubt.
And in our lives is this dogma step of celebrated for a supply.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
And to the 175 chance classified threat at at the supermarket, in my supermarkets of extra-virgin oil-viral balance and tweled different ball.
And you can make a tallow of your own threats to make the case between 175 species of you don't have anything in it.
So that's the assume of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can put your stereoset -- let lucks, cassetttesple -- cassetttesple radio, versturing.
And in that one electronicastore storke, you can choose from this number.
You can put together a six-and-half million different systems, with the parts of the store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communications.
When I was young ago away, you could ask all sorts of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You hurt it up. You don't bought it.
That was the way that it had never been device, it has never been a piece of it.
And that time is ford.
Tuilian are a lot of different devices.
And in the cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- who was the middle -- that with behire and cringer and crings out of the fun break --
And if you haven't seen this model in the store is that model is but you can be sure that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy that doesn't do a mobitial to buy that doesn't do too much does.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, is this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth care, it's in the United States is not that you go to the doctor and you go to the doctor and tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A A or we can do BBut,
This is this front and after that.
Bs has this front and took this front of this one?"
And you go, "Doctter, what does you find it?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and down, and B has this front and down.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doc, if you were to me, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you go."
And we call "own input of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but in a fact that the causes of decision, that the causes of decision of someone who destation of things -- the doctor -- to a bad someone who is free and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient. For on advertises -- the patient becomes a lot of advertises are being created much compared a lot of competitive becomes a lot of competitive becomes a lot of recion, and not the best condition is -- to be in the best condition of the best condition of the best condition of the best
Good up with the bath that crazzy group, you can't buy them.
Why do do if we can't copy them to copy?
Because they think we think the next morning, we are going to ask our doctor to ask that other mark,
Our identity, yet a price, aspect of our exist, is now overbulling choices, as you can see on this slide.
Our identity, our identity,
We find ourselves out -- so we just want to do it.
Everybody morning to be considered to think what person wants to be thinking,
Let's talk about marriage of the marriage, the family.
There's a time that freezes everybody else out of the car that you could be married as quickly as possible and then as possible to kids as quickly as possible to kids.
The only reality was with who, but not when and what you do was not when and what you do about it.
Now free everything is going to be able to get up with it.
I teach a to intelligent students, which I was going to have to do less housing.
They don't have a heavily or in the early of the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Would I say, "Would I not? Am no't marrie?
Or do I wait? Let me first kids, or a career or a care?"
These are all the things that are all the way to ask for that.
They go through to an answer they have an answer to them to have a good catch and not a good number of cat.
And they have right. They're important living questions
And then we come to work with Carl just gave that technology has been able to work every minute of every minute of every day in the world where in the world -- except in the Rolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love to a secret I like to well, where Wify it does.
I don't think because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that enormous choice, which is to make us ask in that we are incredibly asking up and then whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a football of our son, and we can look at the one hand, with our Blackberry on the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand.
And even if they all all of the things are we all of that competition, with all sorts of these things like that, "Am I said, "Am I answer?
Is I response this email? Is I write this letter to write it?"
And even if the answer is "Nee" is, we experience the football of our son's son's son's son's "No.
Where we look at the great, the small materialist things, listim of lifestyl: life is a matter of choycle.
This is the world used to be the world to be used to be there.
There were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choices.
And this is the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what we do is good about what is good about what is bad about what is bad about it.
The enormous choicy choicy has two effects, two negative effects on the human being.
And it's a very conversation effect is that it fairly paralyzed than living to be free in the paralysis,
And with so many choices find people find the harness to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of that, a research of investments in volunted-plans.
A colleague was access of me access to investment data, a big policy-far, a big policy-foot properties with about 2,000 founds spread about 2,000 vements.
They found that for every 10 policies every 10 policies that took the working on the working on the working on the working two percent of the partner.
And in fiftles did at five percent less employees to do less employees than five than five scales. Why?
Because it at fiftig is so hard to choose that people are just to choose the choice to the next day, and that I think of the next day, and that on it, and so on.
And from the exposed to the destroy is coming down.
That doesn't mean that people don't have to eat their pensionate, because they have not been enough, because they don't have enough money to have put enough, but also that the choice known that she was working on the working on the work-parted part of it.
They went to be able to do about 5,000 dollars a year, on their nose.
The working was crafar to endouble.
So too much choicy can work work can work on paralyze.
And I think the world is coming through there.
If it goes to the century to the century to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be recommented with the wrong phone, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we have to do the paralyzing of our and choose of our and choose are less testrangees with the result of the result than it would be if we had less options.
And there are multiple reasons for that.
One is that there is a choice, for example, for example, from past to appear to see that the choice isn't perfect.
You ask you put in this case, that a different choice would have been better to be better to be better to be better choice
This alternative alternative is that you get to get to you on choice.
And then does soon break on the entire choice that you made you made it even if it was a good choice.
The more options, the more options, it's too easier to have under the way of being elected to the element of the options.
Secondly, a second reason with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave already on how often we make the value of things we depend up with the things we comparison.
If you can indent, many alternatives you can see many alternatives of all alternatives that you can see from all alternatives that you defense that you wouldn't deal with the end-off-takes that you can see many alternatives you can inthink of all the alternatives that you can include your enternatives that you can indent,
That makes you less testening with the alternative that you chose.
One excuses. The non-New Yorkers --
This is a little bit of the strettches of this example.
This is on a slide in the Hamptons.
They have a bunch two.
They are on a wonderful strand. Straland. Stralance.
Don't be able to do "Don't you thinking, "Don't you see this man, "It's auggusts.
Everybody in my neighborhoot in Manhattan is excited.
I could car for the door, I could make my car for the door."
And he's about two weeks to the idea that he miss this idea that he misles, and he misles.
And substitutional cost of the entire that we have our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there are the more attractivvator alternatives.
And those presents are substitutional cost of our as substitutional costs.
One example.
This image story, is going to a number of points.
Life in here, and for example, and you don't have to get over.
And one point is that you can do with every choice other choice.
And all that other has so attractions are so attractions that are elected options, which is less attractivity.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this and I came up to a new breeding a new breezing of a new breeze.
I always turned out to be able bridge bridge.
And the most of the stuff was only one kind of stuff that bought you can do it was incredibly uncomfortable unately, but if you the breet, but if you the bird enough to waste, felt the bird of the bited to be the bird at the time, felt it right.
After the years I went to the store for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to have a spirit is my meas."
And the winter said, "Would you smart fit, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Would you be knotor a rhys? Would you like a running or acid?
Do you want to make a bombs on effect?
Would you expand something extraordinary expand whether of pipes." And so he went through
I was there of a spake of it. After a time I said, "I want to say, "I want to the only blow."
He had no idea which was not a any idea which was and so I have an hour countries all the possible breeding all the possible breeds of the breeding of the breeding of the breeding that was a hour country.
And in the sense of that, I left the store ball, and finally I fit with a extending breezing breek.
I did better than I did it better -- I could do it anything that I could do better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Well, for myself out of myself, I wrote a book of my book,
The reason I don't feel better with all of this choice, was that I started expecting to expect of a good job of a good job bird brid.
I started without any any expectation, because I only started to have one kind of spalong to have one kind of spalong of a spirit.
And then there was different from there was different and one of them would be perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I compared my blowing with my expectations, and that asked me that count.
The more possibilities have to have the deserve more expectations they have coasting about the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means people are less testing with results, even if the good results.
Marketing ingdom.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about.
And in the really goes out of that.
Everything was better when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was better,
Because when everything was worse when everything was worse to have a lot of experiences have a lot of experiences.
In our modern society, we can expect as a well-perfection, but the best thing we can get to get to the best we can get to get to the best we expect.
Never we become a touch, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations, and high up.
The secret of happiness -- this is that you have all come -- the secret of happiness is not too much expectancy.
I want to have a little bit -- a car biographically elementary biographically -- I am with a woman who is really fantastic --
I didn't ask me with her less tested with her less testing.
But with less enoughs taking are good opportunities.
And finally, when you have a bad sat a bad bad bad breets if you have only one kind of form is just one kind of predicting you can ask why you can are.
The answer is that case simple.
The world is responsible. Because you have no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bills are available and you buy it turns out to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just as simple. That's just as simple.
You have a better choice.
With hundreds of different bills you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people take decisions and decide even if the results of those decisions about their choice.
And they take themselves out itself.
In the Western societies clinical depression underneath the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the end, but a significant factor in this explosive increase and suicide self-murder, is that people have been so often teleurial experience of their high expectations.
And if they try to explain that teleuration for itself, they give themselves the define itself.
So the nettoresi, is that we have to get objectively on the objectively of it, but our bade.
Another summary a containing one,
This is the official dogma, which is by everybody is being touched by everybody is being touched by everybody is being touched by everybody is being touched by everybody is being available to where everybody is being touched.
But that's not.
It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than not can choose choose but it doesn't automatically that more choice.
There's a magic fluence to choices. Welke, I don't know.
But I know we have been a long time for a long time for a long time to the choice,
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choicy in comparished countries comes out of materialized material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about where the problem isn't so much choice, but right there is too much choice, but right there is too much choice.
So the paradox I speak to the modern, so that I means for the modern, which is the modern, which is the modern,
That's frustrated, and this is frustrategister -- you know, Steve Levitt is told that expensive and sat the kids are not helped from your money.
I say the same thing about this dure, complicated choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to do it.
They make our lives less worth.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all these choices to make all these choices where people have to have a lot of option, life would have to be able to get out of those people have to go forward.
And we have to go on on the way to go forward.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement call a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better from reverbation of well-freddenly poor people -- and that comes through the choice, which we can carry with our our heads we with with us.
And finally, if you read this picture of the sculpture -- you read this as a developed of "Ah, what the fish is here?
None is possible in a fish."
A scrale, a short solid worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, the time I understand that this fish is a little bit of the during of this is a smart.
Because in fact, in fact, this is the hand: If you breeks to create possibilities, you don't have a freedom, you don't have a freedom, but balance.
If you get the fish crops to create potential to create potential of job.
It leads to more disease, and less access,
Everybody has a fish.
This is a free to limit -- possible even for the fish, but definitely for us.
But the absence of a figurementary fishing is questions to remove and disputil.
Thank you for your attention,
