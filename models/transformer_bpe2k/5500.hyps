But this is the entire of this specific problem because it doesn't the desert of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem.
The ick on the North pool is in a seck in the clopple of our global climatter.
It's like the winter and crimpt in the crimpt in the side.
And the next dia that I shows is a very quickly explain the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened to happen.

Forig year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I read back to come back to a update about how that machine works.
So here is a lot of the degenes that there are not waren't the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever education.
It has to the environments that was going to be a billions that were less than a billion second of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the second of the second of the second of the second of the universe were in the universe of the universe of the envirtual second of the environmental homest
Enorm ambition,
This is the machine Geneevation.
We took that the mini-Big Big Bangs in the detectors in the detectors where I work. It's called the ATLAS ASSctor -- 44 meter -- 44 meter in the detector -- 44 meter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the calculate that you can see the scale.
And at 10 years of the year, we put the machine for the first thing we go to the first of the first thing to the first of the first thing we go the machine for the first of the first of the first year.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that are a fact of a fact in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particularly particularly that helped the LHC, and with the operate of the LHC, and the cools of the LHC, which is in the tector of the tector stricks.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September of 10 September that the machine that the machine is a huge over.
I don't know or this is the biggest future, or throw the biggest of the internetpages of the internetpages of this is so from that the internetwork.
That means that we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact that we made a science.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what was working with this golds.
And that behavided 13 thousand of a thousand of the machine on the machine on on the machine on on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine in the machine of the machine of the high
The engineers will say, "Niet you will say, "Niet value of the behavior."
They can do that because they are superidendend his temperaturs.
So on me in 271 graph than the space between the gard, that behaviors that strics that behaviors that strics can be behaviors that behaviors that behaviors that behaviors that behaviolence in 271 degrees that behaviors are the birds of the gars of the grids.
In a of the construction between the needs of the needs of the needs in the LHC, a construction physics.
And it was wireless something black of the black electrical weather electrical weather than 13 thousand of the thousands of the wird of the wird of the wird of the wirell of the wireless of the wirell of the wird of the wirelelectric weath,
This was the result.
This is another inpressure of the desponding that that magnets more than 20 ton that that magnets more than 20 ton the time to be about 30 center works.
We have been making about 50 months of 50 months.
We had to try to talk to the story, what we did did it.
We all have them all the parent.
Now they are back.
Eind mound's going to be the LHC on the LHC on the LHC on the LHC again.
We will be able to go and we reflecting it in juni or right in juni or right and we can go to the challenges of the universe of the universe.
Well, of course, of course, that insluckes the debat the value of scientific research of science.
I think the fact that the fact that the fact that we go on the fact that we go on the fact that we are the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Some phrey Davy, dested the last words of the value of his living the value of his living to the engineering of his life, "No something that are learned to the human beings of the human beingingly for the human beings of our imagination of our imagineering that the world of our mystern that the griciculate of our myster, that that are not a a little bit of the the mastersterstersterstersterstersterstern that the the the the the the the last words of the mamagicions of our mymymysterstersterstery of our mamaggegegegegegegegegegegegegegegets of our y was was was going on the last last worwords of the last last words of the
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask you back to ask you back to your children at your kids in your kids played to play with your blocks.
And when you discovered how you had to go to go to the surface and they were going to get to the line of the teaching of the teaching of space relations.
Rufact, Rure, because with the understand because with the world of the world to understand us to understand us to understand us to the our head.
If a inform inspired by the name of physical interaction of physical interaction of physical interaction and my advision of Kalanithi -- what we started to asking me -- what we would ask me -- what we would ask a computer of the things like a little bit of the wire of a bital of a bital of a critical character that are a bities of a a cross of physical physicicicicics, we could be a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a little bit of the major of course of course of the way of the mamamamajor of the mamamajor of the gragragragragragrainy the cky that that graduce of course, the grew of course, the grew of course, that that
and as we want to learn as we wanted to do?
This question is that we decided to be a answer to look at a answer of Siftables.
Cort a Siftable is a Siftable a interaction of a cookket of a cookkill a cooky.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to do each other, their moved, their movement and they are a screen and they turn a screen and turn a screen and turns out of the hand and they can get a screen and they can put them with the hand they can be able to be able to the hand they can be a battace with the hand they can be a battacking.
And it was beginning is the physical handle is the physical treate, as blocks by the physical trees to go to go to the physical hands.
Boventudies are Siftables a new example of a new ecosystem for the way of digital inforce of digital inforest.
And that these are a more physical differents a more physical different, and even of their movement and even of their movement and even of the way we move them to discovered them in the different different and we have different new and discovery.
I'm going to start with some simple.
This Siftable is including a video to tell a video to tell a video and another, and others are played to be able to be able to be able to be able to play a little bit of the cell of the couple of the cell of the sone.
This interaction of portravics are conscious.
And Indians are each other, they will be able to each other.
And if they are working in the circulate and what single single of single single of them and become and it also become and then it also be.
Do feel they move and hell.
We realize that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the use of these interaction, the use of a little bit of a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a list as a list of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a list of the wire of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of
In this example of three Siftables of the Siftables for and can use them to go to a little bit of a living to go to be able to go to be able to go to be a little bit of them in a call.
If we have been connected to the back.
There's some couple of craping possible for the education of the education of the tape, mathematics where we want to do people to get things to be able to be able to see things that we want to see things that we want to see things that we want to see the result.
Here's the ton -- this is the development of a Fibonaccess of a simple response of a little bit of requice.
Here's a tell that a cruising is a cruising of Scrabble and Boggle.
And the principle is that you get in every single letter on every Siftable, and sense of the words in a words in a words in a works.
No about 30 seconds is the rescure, and different, and different, and differently.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursize to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it out of them to try to make a video of a video of a video of the video of the purposed to make a video of the squate.
They were going to be able to it.
And one of the most interesting things of this future of this future is that people are not instructions of these future.
All of what you have to say "Mole.
Here's some other people on the tests.
That's our both bird;
But, he looks like the Siftables wled.
For him this only was just blocks.
Here's a interaction of a interaction scree.
We wanted to learn a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstrice.
He can bring new carakters in the scapape, by the Siftable with that carakter of the table.
Here's the size of the sone.
Video: The son comes up.
David Merrill: now he has a tractor in the scene in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God was daan! Yeah! Yeah!
Do the scue of Siftables and the nature of Siftables and the carakters and the carakes -- Video: Wife --
DM: and so his story of story.
Video: Hloclock: Hloclocka!
DM: It's a story with a story with a next end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
and he decided to the govern.
Fideo: The cate.
DM: The last example that I will be today today today is a synthesizer that we have been development that we development have been developing a sound of the heard, as the lead, the lead, the basics and press the lead, the basice.
Eengineer, has a different variatiation, which you can be able to use a little bit of your your want.
This sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be inject the pattern of Siftables of the sounds of the sounds of Siftable.
You put a sound in the pattern in the pattern of a life-Siftable effects of a controlerable effects like reverb and filter.
They are a sound sounded to a case and including by cancy.
Salthy the already effects like tempo and exme that are the entire pattern.
Let's look at look at it.
Video: We started a living in two Sify placed in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a very very very lead.
And now I am the basline of the line of it.
Video: Now I feel what slagwork what slages.
Video: And now I now now now now now the filter of the filter of the filter of the filter of the philods.
Video: I can make it very quickly connected by the changed of the tempo bloks.
Video: DM: I'm going to get the filter of the filter of the phililililil.
Video: I can remember the pattern of the pattern of the play.
And I don't have to be able to planns, but I can make improvision, it very long and make a very longer and make a very longer and make a long long and make a very long and make a long and make a long and make it very long and make it very long and make it very longer and make it very long and make it very longer and a very long time.
And in the animms of the dimmming of the volume Siftable to the same of the couple of the couple of the couple of the dimmms.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion is my passion of passion from new people, in the new people, that are involved on the way our brain in the way our brain and body.
And today I had the time to show you one needs in this design is in this design in this design and sams with some of a few possibilities that we are in the lab.
The dareal I want to talk about this is that this only only the connection is the entire generation for the interacters, which is the interacters, which is the information of our world to our world to our world to our world to our world that we want to our world to our world
I thank you you know,
I look at at at your alls to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk about you to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to you all of you to talk to talk to you all of you to talk to you with you to talk to talk to you with you all to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to you with you
I'm write write
But, you know, my work, but also my work, but also more than that.
My whole life in the country, I think of the write of write and I think that that will be change.
And yet, there is something expresent something happened in my life and career, and career, and career, which I had to see my work on my work to be.
And it began with a book, I have a book that I have a memoires, a memoire: "Ead, Bempty that very in the world in my my days and a international work and a international working about and a international sell.
And the consequence is that people are always going to be like I mean or I mean or I mean
What's what -- --
People come to me and questions and you are not bang that you don't know that success you can never be a success that you can never be a little bit of the things that you can never be a little bit of the things that you can never be a little bit of the things to be that you can never be a little bit of the things are not going to be a success and you can never be a success to ask and
Don't job you are very living your life is going to be able to be a book more a book, but never been able to be a book on the blood?
You don't know that bang for that.
And the running of ststitution, you know,
Now, course, that would be very much. But I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a tiener -- if I told a -- if I wanted to be a little bit about -- I wanted to be write that I wanted to be a little bit of -- I was going to be a little bit of the regular.
People said, "Ben you don't know that interesting you never get success to be success --
Don't join the way of education, that you are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of it.
Ben you don't know that you are your life on this work is a lot of that there is a little bit of your your building and that you will be able to your build your building your building your bitters, and you are the bitters,
Its in that that exciting.
In the short is my answer on that questions on that questions on this this is "Yeah,
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are enough that enough.
Althy.
But I'm also a lot of different things are a lot of different things that are not know where all of the things that all of the things that all of other things that are a lot of different things that are not going to know that all of other things that are not going to know that all of other things that that are not not know that all of other things.
For example, example, and other things.
But what I asked to ask the last time I asked myself the last time that angle of the last time
Is the rational el?
Is the logically that somebody is a bad for the work for the work for the work for the work for the work on Earth are see?
What is so for creative process, we create us to make us to make us to make us to make the effects of the equiple of other, something that is not happened to do the effects of the other.
No nothing my father. He was a little bit of artical arguy, and I can remember that there was in the 40 years that there was ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever been in the 40 years for he was not a joined for him or he was not a little bit of it.
And so that you say, "Yohn, how is the chemickade?"
No, it was not about it.
And in fair to become beyond the century of the century of the century of the century of the equired crazy of stuff, depressed coholists to be away.
Scheat, which have a kind of reputation.
Not only write requickly other creative people have been able to be instable.
Look at the grimming doctors the most magnific creative of the 20th century.
For stive young, fellow by the own future.
And even degenes that not move to be a self-pursus to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a self-pursuing place.
In the last interview for his food for his death said, "Meat every of my books is a piece of my books of mselves from my book."
That's what to say about you know about your life work.
But of this kind of explaining to look at more op.
We've all heard the first thing and have heard and have heard the little bit of all.
The head is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is that a poor and that a poor poor of eventually eeventually eventually eventually educated to read to read the end.
So why I want to ask anyone here today question, you know, you know, what you can ask you with that idea of you can ask anyone of this idea of why I want to do you to do with that idea of the question.
Finitial that OK?
Because I'm going to think about a good about it.
I think I think it wead.
And also even even though of course.
I would not like to see that this this century is so gard.
We can creative a lot of more than a lot of approach.
I know that the thing for me. I think it in my situation, without of my situation, without of the dark of life.
And this is the fase that fase in my careers in my career.
Ga but I am a little young, amper veying.
I can have been four decades.
And the way that is probably going to be what I now now now now now now now is now the outside of the world that is the work on that extraordinary book.
We're going to be able to friends in the though you can be selling you you know, hope to be my biggest success of the success of success of the success of the success of the wall.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think if you think about your your your your your your eyes to the hours to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me love to the work of the work of works.
The question is, "Hue?"
And after the conclusion I think I am to the conclusion that I can just just just like a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion of the conclusion in the conclusion of the
I have to create the write of a free far distance of the pull of the pell of the reactile of the reactons on my future.
I have the last year, I have been able to do that.
I'm in the history of the history of the history of the history in other civilizations to see or others in other days have a better way to help a way to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My setttook me to the old Grieved in the old Grieved and Romens.
Let me just just a long and including story.
In the time of the old Grieks and Romenenen't creativity of people who was creativity of hen-self.
Men believed that creativity was a godd-re, that was a re, that of a re, to the human place.
The Griest of this decided of this decision.
And there Socrates that he believed that he had a demon that he had a demon the way that he was a demon the way he was a demon the way he had a demon the way he had a demon the way he had a demon the way he had a demon the way he was a demon the way he was a demmmon that he was a demon that he was
The Romenens, the Romene.
And we have to have this been a creative creative to creative a geni."
The graple is that the Romenen't a geny a geny without a bigger person on a genet.
In their policy was a geny species of a magical godd-entition that are in the murs of the poor of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs of Dobvious.
If the artists the artists of the genassion of genassion of the genassion of the genassion of the genia.
Our fact he was work.
Brilliant! That's precishing the first thing I think about the first thing I think about the psychological protect of your work.
Ider, the deal how that in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work.
The artists was so in the artists of narcism.
If you were working on the bird was not going to go out there there are not going to be there.
Ider, anybody took that a unvisible genious geneey of course.
Well you work on your work -- you know, you know, not only on you,
Ider, you know, you a nogal independent of the genion.
Lange time is that the way in the Wests of how in the Wests was available to be available to be available to be ad.
And then the Renaissance, and everything --
There's a very new ideas, the individual of idea: the individual ments of the universe of the universe of the universe and mysterion.
Go for mystic remedicine, the godnment, from the goddling from the godnment.
That was the beginning of the rational houss.
People believed that creativity of the indivividual of the individual came out of the individual of the individual of the indiviviviolence.
And for the first thing in history, there was about artists in history, and not that they were a geny and not that they had a geney.
I have to say that I have a great front that a big front of a great front of a great front of a great front.
And so one person, one enkle individual individual that he or they have the free of the essentially -- the essentially mystery, of everything about -- the godnmental mystery, creative and the connect of the posingle for a lot of the human beingness for a lot of the human sychelse sychallenge.
Alshed you ask the son the songs.
Egos are resears to gone to gigantic produce and there are incredible expectations of prestaties of prestates.
And I think this present the last 500 years artists of artists a lot of artists a lot of artists a lot of artists a lot of artists a lot of artists a lot of artists of artists that has been made this the last 500 years
If that is, and if that I think that's the question: "What do is the question, "What do is the question: What do is the question.
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old of a old beginning of the relationship of the relation between the human being?
Maybe not.
Because we can make 500 years rational humanism not under to make 500 years of a 18 minutes in a 18 minuted.
And the earlier in the audience of the audience that are scientific two-fell purpose that has been able to the idea that fell of the working on the work of the working of the working of the works.
It doesn't seems me that I will get you in that will get in the time.
And I ask the question.
Why nois?
Why would we have not been doing that I thinking that I thinking about that.
And the quickly as much holds as all the other else of the totally crowed in the other ellow of the engages.
And everybody who has been trying to create something has trying to create -- so in fact, so that it is the creative percent -- you know, it doesn't always creative percent of the creative process of the rational process of the equale.
And that some of the parance.
I have been a great American diche-American dichteres Ruth Stone of the amazing States.
They are desert in the ney-nice. Her entire write them in the newspire of the neint.
She told me about her younught on the plattold of Virginia.
Some of them on the follow on the work was felt the slowed them a little bit about the country.
It was so said to it was a great golf lucky came out.
And this is a little golfed than the country to her fun to her future.
They feeling that the ground her food, and they started to start to shud-time that her on that her on that time to do it for her life.
They running to home, and they were seen by the gone and they had to get it to be able to paper, and paper see and paper on the paper than it to pay and paper than it to get to the cird and they were squickly to get and they were squickly to get and they were the death, and they were running the dieight and then the cra
When the dealing came by her hone was a hund seen her only to write the only chance to write the shaped on the crite.
Sometimes it was not quickly enough.
Then running and running the house.
And in the time it was wood, the sight by her head, a about the field of the field -- in her words -- in her words -- in her other dicheter.
And there were a little bit -- this is the beautiful part of the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the disight of the disight of the time --
And then she was them in house to look at and papier, and wood, and whether it by her heard.
Juist on that time she had a potile to pay a potile of the paking.
And with her other hand, so told me sheat the sight of the air.
And she was a little bit of his strong and trofish it back back in her body back in her body while they were the surface.
In those cases that came out of the sight of the sight of the paper in my sense of paper in the engineered in the environment.
And then I thought that was -- what I thought -- what future, so so free of creative percent of creative percent of the creative percent of the future.
And so it works my creative process -- I'm not a medium!
I'm a muiple of a wall every day on the same time, every day in the same time, and transsssh and transsssh and transssformed a work.
But even in that day-swoom of a experience of experience.
You will also be able to know it is a creative that there creative that there are creative in your opposed to a bron of a brothere, you can impossible to be able to deat.
What is that what is that fun for brone?
How can we use it without that we work?
An a way that we have a way to us a way of us to be a way for us to us a way for us for us a way for us a way that we do for us a way for us
The best contemporainction that I can think I think I can think that I think of this is the whead.
A few years ago, a few years ago to a time a time I was him for a time.
We had it to go.
And in fact, a large part of his life life life life life is that example of his life of the heavily of the major of all of all the major of the making of creative creative creative creative creative that in him in him that oppultists in the opinible creative of his life in fact of his life that are the inpictures of the en
And the ''d Tom what ruster was a rust.
And in Los Angeles Angeles Angeles Angeles of the stradical radical radical radical radical --
And as he heard that he heard a fragmentary of a melodie.
And the decided of head, like inspiration that is the fairly dester --
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fasthrow the fasthese.
But it doesn't go
He had no paper touch, no paper in the taper on the tap.
And the whattace of the head, "I got the meloil of the head, and then it turned the melose of the eight century to me the century of the eugrids.
I'm not good enough enough I can't wouldn't be a t."
He didn't go in panic, but he didn't stop the entire process and destood that whole thing news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry you can see that I set it ups?"
"Denk you really really write that I can reflecting a love of a love of love that I can refrat?
If you want to get this song that this song later, you have to go later, you have to get a time for your hone.
That's not going to be anybody else.
Ga neighborn Cohenard Cohend." And then it was love the process of course, very others.
And the work is another thing that is the beark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the works.
But the sizy of the creative process that creative process in him a when he distance of the genion.
It was going to get him the house and living to the house and living the house.
Tom realized that there was no reason there was not to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to to go to go to it.
It could also a wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and the propersation between Tom and the propertent that not helped that not helped that not helped it was not helped to be a kind of Tom itself was not not help
And that story has my way of work.
I have been a little bit of a head.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle -- Bidds.
And in a little bit of a little bit in want.
You know that that where, you don't want to be able to be a difference, and you think it's a difference. It works.
Not six bridge, really really different.
I wanted to do it all of the project of the project of it.
And then I remember Tom that are geney, and I decided to his genii, and I also also a point of it.
I wked me from my manuscrid of my manuscrid to a lege of the cridge of the cam.
And I said to say "Lister done that if we know that if this book, we know that if this book, that's not only by mician is not only by mice.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in my stop in me.
And I can't feel feet
If you find that the better better than you have to be able to your your your your your things.
She? Don't you don't know you don't know you don't thank you.
I write just write because that's now my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are a little bit of that are just going to be able to be a differentor or different."
Tja--- Uinventually it comes on here.
Eeutties ago in the North African wood African wrong people to get to maance in the heily music.
And the rand hind backward glors.
That was always amazing because the dances were completely professionals.
But some of course, very echallenges a little bit of it.
A of that dance was transcendy.
You know you know what I mean, you have a little bit of that I have ever ever seen a performer.
It was like the time the time the time and the dance of a poor, and the dance of a poor.
He did not a thousands of nights in the thousands of night.
Plotsely he doesn't have a long longer only a ment.
In hem, in head, folding him him him him.
A godnment, a govern.
And if something that happened to happiness what was happened to the Dan beginning to clap them and in clap and in the clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because that was the for it.
Tried a leuf, a listoric factor: When the Mors South South of South of course, they were to measures this couple of the historic factor.
The exactly is echeter by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."
And that is a day day day the day day in the day of stips, and flaments and flaments and flaments of the day in the day of the day of the day of the day day of the day.
If a artists in Spanu or magical or magical or magical or magical -- "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, all of the lah, w."
Our understand a glip of God.
Presume need to have to have to have a regond.
Lastig is echter that the dance of the next morning the next morning to the next morning to the next morning 11 hours of the hours of the hours of the hours of the hours of it.
And in that time he was a little bit of a parenty, not a little bit of the living to be able to be more to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the parent.
Maybe never be a little bit of God to be a little bit of the these.
What has to the rest of his life?
That's hard to that.
That's a creative to sell a creative to a creative of creative to a creative of a creative of a creative to be a creative to be a creative to a creative to be a creative to exactly a creative to be a creative to be a creative
But so pinstitute it doesn't be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be a lot of it.

When you get out there, they are going to be able to someone others.
And so it describe anything.
I am intend to invitial that are doing that.
The last months I have a books, that book that book that book that a lot of a long time where many long to be a lot of a long time to excincluding is excish.
The opportunity of that illuster prediccluster

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olet me
You know, I had a few of this projects a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can discover of our genes.
We started to go from a new point, we were the biology on the digitalize, and now now we were trying to try to a new philile of that digital code in the biology of the biology of life, and synthetise of life.
So we always tried to be trying to be a big question.
"What is something that I think about what many biolos have a lot of biolos have a lot of biolos in different level of a lives.
We try to try different approaching different approaching to less imal components.
We're now now now the digitalizing to the digitalize.
When we have the human genome have sequence, the from the analoge of the analoge of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask question, we can create life or we can create life of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of the universe.
This is the map of a little organize of a little organize of a genitalium, with the colorny genitself can connect itself can connect in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a a laboratory of a little organizing of a laboratory of a collaborator.
And we try to look at a nine or we have a non-colly.
We can be in the order of the order of the 500 of the 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metabolic clearly relative simplicity is relative simplicity of the unze.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at the genes that we can probably that this is a living that this is a living to the cell would be a living to the cell of the genes that we can look at the genes that we can look at the genes that it would be a little bit of the genes that it would be a little genes that this is a lot of the genes that we can
We decided that the only roud of the only roud of the routh of the purposed to synthetise that we could be the components to the components to the most fundamental questions to ask this is the most fundamental questions that we can asked this to ask this chromosopportunity to be the only race of
And so we started asking questions like to ask a chromosed a chromos?"
Staat the chemists that we have this very big molecules that we have never been able to make a little bit of course,
And if we can do that that do, a chromosopiped "opinident "respone?
A chromosope is a piece of chemicically, a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is is requickly, on exponential education.
Our moving to write the genetical code write of write in lose of the genetical code of the genetic code of the genetical code cking.
And our last point would be on this time on this time on a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city, for a couple of craping a bio-ethical fun of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synness of DNA very hard to be a difficult of DNA very hard --
There's a thousands of machines in the world that little stuckes of DNA making 30 to 50 letters in lengs, and it's a degenerative percent of the stuff, how to do it it is a little bit of the stuff.
So we had to make a new method to make a little piece of these little stuckes and the corrigate of all the folds.
And this was our first poging, to begin with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi
That's a little four rus bacteria that bacteria
We designed the stucky of the stucky of the fine of the four incorrection,
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spannment part of the stukid of chemical stines in the bacteria and the bacteria of the genetical code cogs of the genetical particles of the genetical particles of the tools of the tunate.
The virtual particles were working when losed out of the cells, they came back to the cells, and then the E.
I was unlanguage in the olied, and I said that they said they said they said that they said they said that they had to go to be good good quicks.
They laught more than you love.
That's why we think this is a situation is that this situation is that the software are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to try a lot of griculture.
We wanted to build the connect bacterial chromosophind to build the completely moso.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetical cod.
And why we decided to build them in cassettts in cassetts the cassetts that we could experience the cassetts --
And to understand what the cell components of a living of a living of a living of a living cell of a living to be a living cell of a living of a living components of a living of a living of a living of a lifes.
The design is crucial is crucial information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information are very accureat the digital information in the digital information.
When we for the first thing that the first thing that was in 19950,000 aged in 1995 was a 10,000 amazing a 10,000 ased.
And then we found the resequencing of the equency of the wards of the wards of the wards of the ward of the way.
Our course, the design is the design of study of studying that 50 letters are going to be able to all other stuffs of 50 letters to build a little bit of the color of the color of the color of the things that we need to build them to build them to build them together.
We design is a little bit of a parts of a parts of a connection here.
Maybe you have a little bit of that.
Bethink we have a four literal genetical code: A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Trio's of that literally crow 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple of the entire environmental to every single of every single of every aminoxy's hurure.
So we can use the genetical code to write words to write words,
As the anks of the signal of the thing.
Some of the eurgested that there were no distood that there were no did.
We have these stuckes that we made them to build them them with enzys.
There's a single single them and in each other.
And we started to start studying stuckes with studying with stuckes that five to 7,000 letters countries that are purching up and you have stuff, and you have to 7,000 letter, to 7, to 7, to 7, to 7, to 7, to 7,000 years of 7,000 letter, to 7,000 letters of 2,000.
In every city, we have a survive of these studges of these studges that we could create a process that we want to create a process -- that will be very robuy -- that you will see you see you very robuy -- you see you see that you will see that you will see you see them to see them in every couple case them on the squences of these studge.
We try to try to get the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so we come to come to the really big stuff, more than 100,000 aged -- more than 100,000 aged to easily more in E.
And that exercise of all modernal exction of the molecules of molecules of molecules of the molecules of the molecules of the molecules.
And why we went to get to other mechanish.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination that is uses by the biology to the biology to reparers, that stuckes of the DNA can food.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organized mespecially Deinoccus radiod-radiod-radiod-radiods.
And that you see in the both pane: my chromosophind cluding on the other.
12 ot 24 hours later sears later the other now, and precise like the first thing was going to be in the first of the first thing was going to be in the time.
There are thousands of organized organized this arguy.
This organizes can be able to be a lot of it.
They can living in a facuum life.
I know I know absolutely that there is that there is that there can exist, a new aquatically move to be a new aquatically environment.
NASA has been able to show that there is a lot of the is, there are there there.
Here's a little bit of the craph of the molecul that we have been made this processes -- fact that we have been able to just a lot of the call, which we have been doing the studge.
Gist that they are carring automatically carratically carratically
This is not electronen-microscope photograph; this is a microscope.
It's a big molecule that we can see the light that we can see the light that we can see the light that we can see the single of a light of a light of a light that we can see the with a light that we can see it with a light that we can see the with a light that we can see the with a light that we can see the light that we can see it with a light of a light of a light
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences we exacaccess that we exactly including under to it.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetical cod.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a thousands of the people,
And the molecule of the power is more than 300 million.
If we would be able to a 10-points literally spent 142 pages of a pages of the genetical code code the genetical code of the genetical code of the genetical code of the genetics.
Good, how starts a chromosophind a chromosophind a chromosed a chromosed to it.
And the thing is the couple of easy is the couple of easy.
And the bacteria is the much invice.
It's also simple, if you feel like you feel eukaril, like eukard, you know, you know, you know, you know, the celkers and do, and that's what you know if you know what you know as the clone.
And we have the bacterious species is the chromosed in the cell of a chromoss, but we have a complete transpline that we can put a lot of a chromosophind a cell of a a chromosed to a different.
We have a chromosophind of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a micromosed of a chromosophromosed of a chromosophind of a chromosouth of a micromosouth of a chromosouth.
These are about about this is about about a little bit of them and muizing and much.
We feed what extra genes that we could take for this chromosed to this chromosed for this chromoss.
We have been contested with enzymmess.
It was wominal when we put this in the cell of the cell of the cell images -- and you will be a very equromosophic pictures -- the new chromosophim in the cle.
We even thought he was even to talk to about it would come out of the process of the process what it was going to developing the process of them to development.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional evolutionary mechanism.
We discovered all of the chromosed a second chromosed or a third of a third thing that they have been been in one time to the species of the species.
People that evolution is going to be a little bit of a teaching of biology is not a lot of biology and regully.
There's a single enzyms that restrics are enough that are enough that works.
It was not chromosope that in the cell was not easy.
The cell -- the chromosopm that we stop -- which we stop -- which we too.
It was express the other chromosed the other chromosophim as a strange material -- and so we had been been been been been been been the cell of chromosophice.
He was blauing the genes that we had been tained in the genes that we had stop in the genes that we had to get it.
And in very short time to the celarakists of the carakistics of the ene species of the new species of the new soften that we had been in the cell of the cell of the cell we had stop in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new sof,
All of the whate, the membrans, the genetical code -- when we was the genetical code was the precishing was changed.
This maybe this main the genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the software in the software DNA, to change things fundamental things.
Good, I have been paying a little bit of this is not a screepping -- this is about 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I have been paying that we might be a new new species of the Camic explosion of the Camic explosion where there are a new species where there are a new species where there are a lot of this is a digital new species where it in this is a new species of course, that we are a new species where there is is not a new species of a lot of a lot of a year, and a a years.
Why would you do?
And I think it's woman is the womban as you look at what there is going to look at what there is going to look at what there is going to look at what there is there.
We're going to go from ses-simple of six half to 9 billion people, in the next 40 years.
And in my context in my context in 1946.
There's three people on this planeetal --
And every one of us that in 1940, in 1940 years in 1940 years of the 40 years of us are four in 1940 years of us in 1940 years of us in 1940.
We have a little bit with food, with the connection of screen water, medicine, fine for the sizes-half billion billion.
That's the way to do that for neighborn that for neight.
We use fibillion ton cold, more than 30 billion of fatton on fatton on the holy.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we ended biological process, in ogency or whate, or which is also about that a huge of the process of course, it is a huge of a huge except of the during of the engages.
Then of course, of course, of the cools of the strained in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
And all our world's discovered in the discovered discovered on about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the design of the future.
The electronics had a dog industry had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is from from the animals.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We don't have a thank these, thesesemethods to do a little bit of the "combination genomics to do so that we do.
We have the possibility to build a great robot to build a million chromosomes a day and a day a million chromosomes a day
If you think if you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes of the case of the call, or to make octon or medicine, new faccess to produce, we can change with a little team of the team of the science. And we can change in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can select for lifes, chemical or brandster or brandstope production, faccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design of what real design, is what real design, so you can really go to the gang of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what the computer of what the computer of what the computer of what we can design and a new species of what the computer of the computer of the computer of what real design of the real design of what the computer of the computer of what we can can design and a new species of what the computer of the real design of the real design species of the the the the the real design of what we do is is is is is is is is is is is is is
We don't know what it will see it out how it will see it out of it.
We know what their genetical code of the genetical code of disead.
We are now on our generation on four generation of future.
Our glanguage have your ethanol of your honol of your experiment.
We've got second to generation and generation that are going to come from from come from come from come from come from from come out of more high or different different kinds of different different types of neighborn or different kinds of neighbor.
But the only way we think that biology is great influence that biology can have food higher and the protect of the describes and the described as we started to do that that the way we are food to be able to design that that we are the way that we are the way that we are the way that we think we think we are about 18 perforforce and thinking, you know, we have the first generate of the making about 180.
Sonlip and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovered our world's discovered in the world.
This is a organized that we have remoted.
It lives in the deepsee, about 2.5 kilometer dippepead, at coals.
It made a third of CO2 with the call, of molecular water water water water water water water water and as energy bron.
We're looking at the same or we can take CO2 CO2 and easily to be fabrout, where that CO2 2 to fabrunning this process to bring this process to brand-to sturing this process to sturbb.
So in a short of a little bit of that we think we are in his way that we are in his basal question: "What is life is life is life of life is life of life is life of the life of the life is that we living in a short of a short of the basal question: "What is that we are in a short of a short of a short of a
We have been working -- have the described the petrochemical industry industry industry industry industry of it.
Yeah, you can't do this in TED -- where you can do, where you can do, what?
A important energy is a important energy brother.
But we work on the cell of these works.
This year, we always was the gricult, we always always just like to the fact the fact on the right fish faccin.
I think that can change that can change by the teaching of teaching cinating faccinincluding to make that you can make it by the cinating of teforward.
Here's how the future of the future, the evolution, the evolution, the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and extending on synthetic bacteria, and extending your cirness of the future.
We have been fardly affected from people.
Our dogle is a changing that we make a chance to make a chance enough to do that that well.
What I want to show you you like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we have to have a years ago to a years ago to a years ago.
And it's a environment in the way in your local or on the dead of the diseen of the governmental fisual data
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can be able to be able to be in the hundreds of the homens, and except the sors of our enters.
And it doesn't make a lot of information we look how big this collections of this collections of images are images.
Most of his normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan from the Library of Congress, and sit in the 300 meapixel of the 300 meapxic.
It all doesn't make not not because the only thing that the prestaties would be able to be influence on a third system, the amount of the cels on the screen on the screen on the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the prestattinfluence.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of not-image of now, a example,
This is the graue of Dickens. Elke cars. Elke is a headd stuff.
And to evidence that the works, and no imagination, and no imagination, we can see something that this really teaching is not a picture, and this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a touch of what a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of what a book of what a took of what to living a book of the way to lip a way to read a a book of a book of a
I would not be a little bit of it.
This is a realistic, this is a example. This is a example.
Every very big image of a little bit of a entire deal.
This is a little bit of the place and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or crape, which is also a scalend of medium is a write of medium is.
We also have something that one of this explain the amount of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this ideas we can really be able to connect the betions of treates of treatats that we can do.
We don't have a population of that means more means and other third -- not eul -- not needed to be more than be more than be more than be more meaningings.
And of course, of course, a nice for the hand a soon gency for a technology as desize, I will be a time on this time to this is a time that we can also have a lot of the fellow of this fellow in the fluence of this follows.
These are all the U.S.
And the picture of a picture, of the NASA

We think that polemic -- we think that a power of a polemic -- we believe that stories is the world can change the world that we probably the best thing that we probably the best thing that we are the time in the world is that we are 35 million times in the 156 million dollars and so we are in 156 countries and we are a million.
We make a fell fell of resister to the education, with our audience, to be able cultural places that the toeschallenge, which is so that that the toeschallallallenge, so that he hopefully the way that he hopefully the world that we can be a little bit of the world that we can find a difference that we can find a way that we have a way to be a way to be able to be a way to be able to be a way to be a requicicicicicicicicicicicultititimultions of a responestestestestestestestestestestestestult a a a a a a cult a a little little bit of the world that we respult a little
where all of the education of all of the consider,
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about a few questions that I asked a book of a book.
Maybe you can see parall, you can see parall.
And so I also try to explain what rebonce you have a little bit of a little bit of a lot.
I want to start with the official dogma.
And we have to become the official dogma of the wester, of all the wester, industrialized together.
And that official doggs like to get the follows, Om the while of our citizens, in the high of our citizens, we need to get them as much possible individual free of freedom.
Freedom is a big good, a great good, a major part of the human entire of the human exist.
Boddle free to treat our inside, to treate, to get a higher while to be a higher without without without without without without of third in the third of these.
The ultimes, we find in choicicial ability.
Mer choice homes in that people have more free in that people have more free.
And more free-free-price.
This is so diep in our society that no one one one of our society would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in our society
And in our life is this doggma step step of the city.
I'm going to give you what example, you know, of our modern.
This is my supermarket a middle of a tunate.
Even about dressings.
No that 175 can, in the 175 can, there are in my supermarket of different extra-virin different extra-virin the phoil different of a ball, and two, and slip in my supermarks.
And then you can take your telling your telling together, for the case, for you, for you've got a species of the single of you,
So that's the engaged of my supermarks.
Look at electronicawindos. You can see itself in the stereoset -- cassetttespiple player, radio, radio diverss.
And that ended the electronics you can care you couple of this approach.
You can have seen six million different systems and a million different systems out of that windoctor.
Give -- you have a lot of chooks.
And I think about -- communication.
When I was was a long time I could tell you you couldn't deal phone-Bell.
You cost the fun of the fun it doesn't fre.
And that had been construction that it never stuff.
And that time is the time is for it.
And the way there are very different future.
For fall of biell phones is the diversity imment.
These are the mobile of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle of the gararksile and cracy and cracy fellow and cracy fellow of other.
Because you have not a model of this model not in the winke, but you can see that that battace that binside of his that happens.
And the data are going to the winkle and stop this question.
And you know how the answer on that question,
No
It's not possible to couple of the purpose that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of life that are much more more more more than the attention of the purposed of choice to, this explosix of choices a face.
Gealdone -- it's in the United Statate, in the United Statates, and that you don't have to do you doc.
No, you go to the doctor, and you know, "We can do do or we can do, or we can do, or we can do.
Another this present -- and tunate.
And then this predict -- and what you want to do you do?"
And you say, "Dok, what is what you find is what you find is the invention?"
And the doctor, "Anow, and and tunate, and and the free of this present -- and tunate.
What you want to do you to do?"
And you say, "Dok, if you was what would you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not going to be not."
And that we call "own including the patient.
And that clinks very positif, but means in fact, that the sware of the shaped of a consideripment of says -- the doctors -- the doctors -- a little freet, somebody who are not seems to a bigger -- the patientire condition to be able to the patiengain the condition of the recenters.
Goodly available to that ners, because the doctory because the do, you can't get them to care them to be not copy.
Why are remaining them, if we can't get them to get them to get them to get them to get them to get them to copy them to do them to do it.
Because they think they think that we think we think that we have the morning our doctors to ask that other mers:
Our identity, too a crapid aspect of us exist, now is now about on this diad.
Our identity, is the way of our background.
We find out of -- so far, we want to do but we wanted to do but so far.
Itttone of the surface to the opstine of your think, which is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the surface.
Let's talk about the house of the house.
There's a time a time that free-free-free carbon on the craise of that you could be able to children and so quickly as possible to children.
The only only work-couple of the choice was not when you conted.
Now free that is free to the opportunity.
I love to read without without a students, which I thinking about twintive percent of the homized and then the except than early early than early lier.
They are not not describe or air, or air, in the early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices of a crapy.
"Sall I got or not? Salready no?
Or I'm going to go to wait? No I first kids or a care?"
These are all the questions of question.
They go through to them a answer to have a answer to be able to get their house and then it out that they get a good coople of them and it doesn't go out of a well.
And they have the same thing thing about that.
And then we come to work. Carl good, as all of that technology us to be able to work every minute every minute of every day -- where, where the world -- it also also -- in the Randolph Hotelteltely Hoteltel.
There's one place one place that I love a place that Wii, where WiFi the Wiii the do.
I wouldn't be able to be able to me.
But good, which is huge choices of work in that we are still asking us to ask us to ask us to go and we go to go or we go or not.
We can look at a footbalthy from our son our sion, with us to look at our six can, and our Blackberry our Blackberry our laptop of our laptop on scree.
And even if they all get out of the task of that we every minute of that wedly asking about all of the questions of the phone of the phone of the phone?
And I all this emailing to this emailing reager? S?
And even if the answer "Ne" is, we experience the footbaldge of our son on a very different way.
Where we look at look at the coll, the coll, materialistic things that life: life is a craise of coops.
And so it was the world excity.
There's a couple of choices, but not everything was a crapy.
And so the world now, the world now.
The question is, Is this good or bad or bad it well?
The answer is: "Ya."
So we all know what is good on is, so I'm going to talk about what is a bad of it.
And that huge of the equity has two effects on the human beings.
A very connection is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first of the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing is that the first thing
And the way of choicallenges of choicickly to make a choicks.
I am a very behavior, a very behavior of investsts in free-investsts in freedom.
A colleagues of me to investment to investment of Vanguard, a big policy of Vanguard, a big million works.
They discovered that for every tions of every tions of the working the work-fare, the particularly two percent of the tomine.
By fif-front foundes in the tunch of the tunch of them in five founds. Why?
Because the thing that the fif-foundation is so lasts to couple of people to see that people are just to the next days, and that people are explained to the next days, and so on.
And of explained to dead.
And that means not only that people after their pensive hold, they have no droog brought because they have enough money was also that the choice was so far that was so laster that they were so laster to have the works.
And then they have been been able to 5,000 dollars a year to their neus in the neus to go to go to go to go to be 5,000 dollars in the 5,000 dollars a year.
The workly was a little bit of the workly to reach their own behavior.
And the lot of choicices can connect work.
And I think the world that the world is that the world of disease of disease.
If the century of the century gasummber, you want to be very group of the choicicips, right?
You don't want to be sure on the electrial fone, or even the elected or even the elected or even the elected or even the wrong of it.
That's the first effect is the second effect is that we, as we had the lost of us -- and then the lost of us and coople of us -- eeducation with the results of the results of us as we had to be like to the feel of the entions of us had to be like that.
And there are measure of redentify to feel it.
A of that, there's a choice, for example, for example, you know, the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choice,
You can be able to be able to that a sense that a other choice that would be a little bit of a choice for that a little bit of a case for that a other choice that would be a different choice that would be a different choice that a other choice for that a different choice for that a couple of you would be in a a sense.
This is droom alternative to be able to you get your your your choice.
And the way to the follow of the follow of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choicice.
And how more optons are easize the is to be to be to have the spike of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cood.
A second reason has been doing with substitutions.
Then Gilbert gave to the morning of how fish we have the value of the things that we have to be able to be the things that we consisimilar to be the things that we are the things that we are the things that we requaling the things that we are the things that we are the things that we have to be able to the value of the things that we are the value of the things that we are the things
If you can invention many alternative to indentify many of all the alternative of all alternative that you deal of all the alternative that you device.
And that makes you get less tests to the alternative that you have cost your minds.
A predictiny notice the New Yorkers on the same excuses.
This is a little bit of the street of this example.
This is on the cample of the Hample of the Hample of the Hample of the Hample of the Hample of the Hample is in the Hamptons.
They have a second second single second to the wone.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend on a ment.
Beter can not?
Ider, a in my buurt in Manhattan is the city.
I would would be my card for the deal for the device for the device."
And he seen two weeks of this single that he was every day he was a great parkyet park-parking.
And the entire of the entire of the population that we have to get of our choice that we have a great choicice.
And how more possible possible to be more involved in the more improduce of alternative alternative to be more
And that presents us as substitutional costs of our substitutions.
Another example.
This image of the image of a number of points.
Let me in the room and now for example, and you don't have to go to go.
Another point is that you with every choice every choices of choices of choices of the choicice.
And all that other has been so much of the changed of the crapy of the crapy.
And third is the escalation of expecially
I came up on the time. I came to a new blove to a new bird bone.
I wireless to play in the spirl.
And it was a kind of play to be a kind of play and the cost totally you know, it was incredibly not the sat the sat the bound, but if you know, but if you were able to be enough to be enough to enough the totally bate.
And after the wind I went to the wind for a newled.
I said, "Day, I want to a speap a speak of a main."
And the winter said, "Wilt you slim slim fit, easy fit?
Whilt you whether a ritten of the rite of the heard of the head?
Wilt you a bird with decision.
Wilt you something explaining pips, or flink or flink on the pip." And so he went out out of the pips,
I was a little bit of the Surcky of it.
He had no idea that was not a little bird that was a hours of a hours of the entire moving to produce a hours of passs.
And thousously of the winkle the winkle the winkle of the winket of a bound.
I had the better day. Do all that possible to be the possible.
But I feeling me feeling me for me.
Why? Om this to do this on himself to explain a book, I got a book.
And the reason I don't feel a felt with all that choicicife that I was started to expect the strained of a good spose of a good spoking.
I started without a few waition, because I started a kind of played in a kind of spotly.
And then there was a different wards, and one of them would be perfectly in the perfect.
What I was cost-cheat, but not perfect.
And so I reach my bound, I was going to go and that the deal of the teleur.
How more possible possible to be more expecially more expecially they have been about the response of that moving that mobilities.
And that means that people are less tests are the results are the good results are the good results.
Marketings don't know this
Because in that case, you don't know where I haven't where I talk about it.
In the really is about what it is about so on.
All was a little chood.
Because when everything was just a little chickly people have been been going to have a little bit of experience.
In our modernal society we can have a experience as a various citizens, but the best thing we ever ever ever been doing something that is something as good as we had been so good as we had been so good as we had been so good as we had been so good as we had to be as well.
And it ever responding to be restraine, my waiting are, my waiting are.
And it was a sound, it is the couple of happiness -- the heather of happiness of happiness.
I want to talk to -- a car -- a car car -- I was a car -- that I was a woman who working is a woman who workly is a great tily that was a great --
I have not a little bit of the tests of tests and a little bit of the ford.
But with less enough needed to be good opportunity.
And so so that we are a bad of the spose of the spirit is a bad of the present of the present of the connect of your your your intests you ask your intests and you intests you are the bad of the sponted.
The answer is that feel simple.
The world is responsible to you have no choice.
But if there are different bounds of different bound, and you know, and you know, you know, you know, there is a that turns out to fall, who's responsibility?
The answer is just like that. It's just so simple of the ice.
You're a better choice.
Meducated different bounds of a bird of a recuus to fale.
So if people decided to take the results of that decisions of that decisions are good about their churged about their choice.
And that needs them to calculate themselves.
In the western of the clinical depression the young of the young generations of the young generations of the young of the young of the young of the young of the young of the clinical depression the clinical depression the young of the garentire of the clinical depression the young of the
A factor -- not the enion, but a significance of the explosive to this explosion, and self-regularly -- that's so ffish is that people are so ffar experience in fact, and they have been able to have been able to have their high-food.
And if they have been able to explain the churpose to explain the cull of themselves to be able to be the scule.
And the nettory is that we have this objective is that we have this objectively to fell us on the fellow feeling of feeling a bad feeling of a feeling objectively that we feel the objectively that we have the objectively that we have the objectively.
Another a little bit of a society.
This is the official dogma, that is the craine.
But that's not it.
And the list not a two-fell that can be better than not be able to be able to be more choicicians are more choicicician that more choice that more choicicks.
There's a magical cluding on choicically. Waay, I don't know that.
But I know that we all country, we have been able to the point that choicices are that choicice.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm going to be a principle where we can be the best of our best on the best of the best of the best of the best of that we can love the best of the best of -- a principle -- a principle -- a principle where we can love the best of the best of -- a principle where we can do it --
The choicick in instance, in including countries are in material ages from material age.
There's a lot of places on the world, we have heard about all about the problem that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there there is that there is that there is that there is a lot of choice.
The paradox that I speak on this is so that I think that I think of the moderne, which experience Wests.
That's frustrerend, and the third of this is that you have been told you you have told you to told you to have a little bit of your your your your your your your your your your your your money.
I say you know, I saw the same about this thousand of this is the choices -- they haven't highed it hone.
They make us us less value.
If a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all that choices of people who was going to have been been to do in the way of people who would have been on the people of that people in the people of that people on the people on the people in the front of the people in the choice of the people in our society of the people who was in our society of the people in
And in the way of life would be on the predicdicine.
That's what economs is a Pareto-connection called called Parea.
Everybody is a better better than the reververage of the map of the map of the poor people -- and that comes by the last of choicices that we have to us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with the home.
And so so you have a lot of the image of the imaged of your mind: "Ach, which is what you know, what you know, is fish of the fish of it.
Nothing is possible in a visual sense.
A scree of a short of a short of -- that was my first interpretty of interpretation.
But how long I thinking about the time I think, deaths I think, I think, I think this is possible slim is possible slim is possible slim of the slim is a little bit of the long time.
Because in fact, in fact, there's this treate, if you know, if you get the fish of the healthy to create the free of the free, but reflecting your free of the treate, but you have no fish to the treate, but you have a fish of the treate, you have a free-fish.
If you get the way to create the way to create possible to create the way you get less testate.
It lets to more reverlamming and less tester and less testacy.
Itther has a fishing of a fish.
This is free seems -- even even for the fish for the fis, but it possible for uncall.
But the destrainy of a figuring of a figuring questions to ask you to ask you know, unheil.
Thank you for your your attention.
