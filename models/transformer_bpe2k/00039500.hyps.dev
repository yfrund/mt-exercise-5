Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the polar ice capture, who had about the past three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this particular problem because it wasn't going to show this particular problem.
The ice skap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It's in the summer. It's in the summer.
The next slide I showed is an accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is taken in red.
Like you see it down to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the shrimp in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, five years or older, which is almost like flowers here.
In 25 years, it has gone to this.
And that is a problem because the frozen free around the Northern Ictual warms, and there's a very big amount of frozen carbon frozen carbon frozen carbon is the death by microbes in methane.
Rather with the total amount of display in the atmosphere, that would be able to double that amount that amount that amount as we describe the point.
In a couple of undeep in Alaska borrely methane on from the water.
Professor Katey Walter went from the University of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is right.
One reason for that, is that this enormous warmer Greenland from the north.
This is a melectwater river.
The water volume. The water volume is a bigger than ea.
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soads because the landics meless, then this is the place where it gets into the sea.
These floods. These flight.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole.
Last month, reported the whole continent has been a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the Southern of the South ple of the South ple of underwaters.
The whole continent, the whole continent stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two-largest ice massa, there are now, which was another couple of years ago.
40 percent of the world's population, the half of his drinkwater from that smell time.
In the Andes, is this gaper the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more flow.
But when they disappears the drink water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions.
This global drought has read to a dramatic rise of business burns.
And the number of course, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen any speed.
Four times over the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely untable.
If you look at it from a historical context of a historical context what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours.
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille Ocean area of America, astonishing, and every side of the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of oxygen in the ocean.
The only great cause of the global warming of the Earth, that for 20 percent of the Earth, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest emissions with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coals.
But we see a circle.
These are the coal-carbon which the bottom was annuated in the last years, and where green alternative alternatives.
There is a political fight in our country.
The coal carbon -- and oil industiry gaven 250 million dollars of to promote coal coal coal coal, which is a contradiction that is a contradiction of dignity.
I think that picture.
And then the home became the home of Tennessee, about four billion gallon.
You've probably seen it in the news.
This is the one biggest flow in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertintentions of the rocope shape.
Video: "Frosty the coal guy is a continued guy.
He's overfluence here in America, and he makes the America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the rosty carbon guy with the day.
He's affordable and estimate and employees."
Here's a big part of the coal in West Virginia in West Virginia,
The largest mines of the country is the great jobs of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know where they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate.
This is a piece from a piece of it.
Video "ALergy COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why it is the reason the major goal is to give a giant connections to advertising for the light and bring the light of the truth of stone carbon carbon.
Feit is, coal is not smary.
We find that the clean is -- and it again.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
So let me just talk about it.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean coals.
Fantastick! The machines are pretty much noise.
But that is the sound of clean coal technology.
And despite the fact that it burns of coal warming, one of the main causes of global warming global warming technology that you see everything.
Look at all, this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative,
Video: Video: America in crisis, the economy, the national security security, the climate crisis.
The red wire winner is our dependence of fossil fuels of fossil fuels, as dirty collects and oil.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
Before of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America work, a plan that makes us safer and global warming.
Finally, a solution that reverse enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Intdet.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Video: It's going to re-energy.
And one of the fastest ways to make an end, to our dependence on our dependence of old fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create jobs.
Voice: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speaks that says, "If you want to be everyone.
If you want to go far together."
We need to go far, and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am for those who are not sure those who are not -- the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever undernear.
It must be the circumstances that were advanced less than a billions of second after the universe was began to be 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious!
This is the machine is the machine.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the scale.
In 10-September last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that caught for a partment in the control room.
It's a photograph of the first particle that was all around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, valvalue in the detector in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that photograph at 10 September the machine, which is a tremendous consideration.
I don't know if this was the biggest apply or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page looked like this.
That means that we have a cultural and a scientific impact as a scientific impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden weat.
Those weathers 13 thousand a thousand equal force.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. They're too small drad."
They're able to do that because they are super entire temperatures.
So on minus 271 degrees, colder than the space between the space that can behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine of nine in the LHC, was a constructive.
And then the wire was wire something and was suddenly electric restance against that 13 thousand ampions.
This was the result.
This is even more impression, if you realize that the magnets more than 20 ton away, and they were about 30 inches -- and they were moved.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to pull them out what we did.
We've been repair.
Now they are back on the way.
Eind map the LHC will be again.
We're going to put it back and we expect measurements in juni or justice, so we can go to figure out what the construction of the universe.
Now, of course, these accidents the debate of the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easily. It's easy.
I think the fact that the fact that it is so difficult that we go beyond as the LHC.
I showed the last words to English scientist Humphrey Davy Davy Davy Davy Davy, who was taught experiments of his learning was Michael Farave was Michael Farather, "Nsomething so dangerous for the human mind that our images of the human mind that there are not a mysteriod, that there are no new worlds are not completely new world." And that there are no new world."
Thank you very much.
And I'd like to start asking you back to your children back to your childhood when you play with blocks.
And when you discovered how you had to grab them up, and they picked up and consciously, you was to learn to solve it with and hands of space relationships.
Ruimtely insight is strong by understanding the world around us.
And if a information that an information, inspired by the idea of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my collaborator, I began to ask -- began to ask -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer of digital fingertop that moves on a plate physical finger that mosts on a plate physical freaublaw with physical physical physical interaction with things.
and we can ordered as we want?
And this question held us so that we decided that we decided to find an answer by building Siftables.
Cort case is a Siftable computer in the size of a cooky.
They can be moved with the hand, they can feel each other, they can detect their movement, and they contain a screen and wireless.
The core nuclear understanding is the physical treatment of blocks, just like blocks,
Bovendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the manipulation of digital information.
And this is that this aid resources have a more physical differently, aware of their movement and even of the way we move, and even of the way we move, there are different new and fun interactions to discover them, there are different new and also interactions of the way we move them, and even of the way we movement them, there are aid.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instony to tell a video, which is that played by office, which is plays and differently.
These interactive portraits of consciously.
Indians next to each other, they're going to interest for each other.
If they get surround, they can also notice this and some nervous as well.
Turther feel movement.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction, the use of a color as it was an extraordinarily as it was a fluid as a liquids.
In this example in this example of three Sifttables, and I can use them in a empty color in a empty color in a empty of example.
If we have the threat, we went back.
There are just a couple possibilities for education, mathematics with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the opportunity to see.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci by a simple calculation programmate.
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
And the principle is that you get around a random letter on every Siftable, and it's controlled words in a dictionary words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds it is very rehapes a new series of letters with amazing possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try it and make a video.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions.
Everything you have to say is "But, and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people test the tests.
And that's our youngest ber right.
And it turns out the Siftables.
For it was only blocks.
Here's an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning from language.
This is Felix that demonstration.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene.
Video: The orantractor.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siptables and Siftables and the next to each other, he can respond to the characters respond to each other -- Video: Watching the characters.
DM: And so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I'm going to show today Is a synesizer and live music and live music that we developed, where every Siftles a sound as the lead, bass and drum.
Eenvironment has four different variations, where you can choose what you want.
These sounds can be injected in empty Siftables so you can determine the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern through the patterns of an empty Siftar. There are live controlable effects like reverb and filter.
They're getting sound to a sound and adapted by office.
Turther the general effects like tempo and volume that the whole pattern.
Let's see.
Video: DM: We're starting with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern by an extra lead.
Now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I add some beat.
Video: DM: And now I copy the filter of the press, so I can affect the effect live the effect,
Video: DM: I can accelerating it by the office of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I'm coping the filter of the bas for what's more expression.
Video: DM: I can reaching the pattern as it is playing the pattern.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything.
And eventually the animals of the volume Siftable to left on the left.
Thank you.
Like you can see, my passion goes to create new human computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better dested in the way our brain and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design region with some opportunities that we are developing in the lab.
And the thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attention to a whole new generation for the interact with digital tools for the interacting with digital media that information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it with you.
I'm writer.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My entire life for a long time of writing and I don't think that it will change.
And yet, there is something that happened in my life and carrier and carrier, which I had to re-relationship with my work with my work.
And it began with a book that I have written written a memoire: Beminnerat, which is very very contradiction to my earlier work around the world, and an international exist.
And the consequence is that people have to go everywhere.
People that -- gets go!
People come to me and questions, "Don't you afraid that you can never get this success.
Are you going to keep your entire life suggesting your entire life, but never published a book that people are going to walk?
Don't you get these?"
Remember, you know.
Of course, that would be very remember, I remember, I remember, I was a teener -- I was a teener -- if I told I wanted to be writer.
People said, "Don't you get success.
Don't you remember, you know, that you will go through this one?
Don't you get your lives on this work without any of this work, without that there ever anything out of your broken on the puin of your broken dreams on the puin of your broken bitter?
Something in that streting.
In the short, my answer to the questions on that "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called
All right.
But I'm also for a lot of other things, you don't want to know where everything.
For example, for example, and other things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time that come from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is affected to be afraid to the work for that they have been taken to their opinion.
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make sure that we make sure the effects of the spirit of the minds.
Take my father. He was chemist, and I can't remember, and I can't remember that there was a person ever asked to him that he was ever asked to him whether he was not afraid.
And that said, "John, how did it with your chemblock?"
No, it wasn't talking about.
To be fair to be fair engineers by the centuries through the centuries are not the reputation of the reputation of mal-depressive alcoholists.
You know, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have turned out to be reputation pretty instable.
You only look at the grimming death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
A lot of young, often boy, many of them display.
And even the ones that no suicide suicide suicide suicide.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "You know, each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's pretty much to say about your life work.
But of this kind of excited we don't see anymore.
We've all heard it all before, and have it been accepted.
The reason is that creativity is that creativity.
So I want to ask everyone today I want to ask everyone today, you can live?
Do you have that OK?
Because now I think about it, I think I don't think I think it's not a pretty good thought.
And I think I think it's refrigor.
And even more dangerous.
I'd not like to see that this century.
We can spire creative minds much better to live.
I know sure that it would be in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live.
In fact, you know, the phase that my career now.
Go too: I'm a young, among a regular year.
I can do maybe four decades.
Hharastony probably everything I now published by the extraordinary world as the work that extraordinary is that extraordinarily successful book.
We've been here with friends under each other, so I can probably you can probably be my biggest success.
Jemy, what a idea!
If you go and thinking it for you in the morning, you know in the morning,
So I don't want that.
I love that I love to the work I love with the work I like like this.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after a long time I think of the conclusion that I can only go to write with writing as a psychological protection in the process.
I have to write a safe distance, a safe distance between myself and my beliefly understanding anxiety for the response to my future publications.
I've been looking for the last year, I've been looking for ways of doing that.
I'm in the history, and I'm doing it in the history, and forced me in other civilizations to see whether any better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search for me to the old Greeks and Rom.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombs and Romon, people were not that creativity was from herself.
People believed that creativity was a god-red, which of a displayers, and unknowled-knowledged reasons.
The Greeks called the Greeks called the creativity of creativity "demon.
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon the words influist.
And the Roman had a similar idea.
At them was called a several mind creative mind creative minds.
And the funny is that the Romb with a genius.
In their polisy was a kind of magic god-magic god-suffered entities in the walls of the ength of the artist.
And a little bit like Dobby the house --
If the artistic was working was the genim assistance.
And he gave a shape on the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance where I had the earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work.
The artist was taken so in protection, for example.
If you was brilliant work was brilliant, you weren't all the hall.
Everybody knew that was an invisible.
Do you get crowd, then that not just you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty inhanded genia.
Long time that was the way in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything.
And there was a whole new idea: the individual people, the individual point of the universe and above all the gods of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures,
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity.
And for the first time in history, there was about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius.
I have to say that a big mistake,
To one person, one single individual -- one individual is that he or she is the vehicle, the source of the century mystery of everything that didly, creatively and the known before -- that is too responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
As if you ask somebody asks the sun.
EGigantic proportic proportions and there are increasingly high expectations to prestons.
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years.
If that is, and I think, "What is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we return on an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between human and creative mystery?
Maybe not.
We can remember 500 years, we can't make 500 years in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes.
Probably in the audiences people who have reduced the scientific people who have rescue about the idea that elflow creatures with some feeent the work of artists.
It doesn't seems me that I'm going to get you in that.
And yet, I'm going to ask it.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we be able to do?
It's just as much as much as much as much as all the other explanations of totally calculated unknowledgement that decided in the creative process.
Everybody who's trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, all the attacks here -- you know that the creative process is not always rational.
that sometimes it feels almost paranorally.
I have the amazing American closer Ruth Stone.
She is thick in the ninet.
She told me about her childhood on the Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was felt on the field, they heard a poem about the country.
And it was, they said, as if there was a big golf air came out of it.
As a poem of golf over the country to its country to her.
She felt that the ground, and she knew her feet, and she knew that her at that moment, only one thing to do.
And then they ran home, and she had to go through the poem and they had to do it as fast as quickly possible.
When it pulled by her hand her hand her her hand her only was her only opportunity to write.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then they roughly won't reaching the house.
And at such moments the poem by her, disappearing over the field -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem.
And even though there were some of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost poemist.
And then she was looking for paper and paper, and paper, and paper the paper by her him.
Just at that moment, she had a pencil.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked the poem out of the air.
And she picked the closer to his tail it back into her body, and she wrote it back into her body, and she wrote the way.
And in that cases the poem came up with paper at paper, but then in the paper order.
When I heard that, I thought, I thought -- which is so exactly my creative process, my creative process.
This is how my creative process! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I am a mouth, whose every day on the same time, and flowered with blood, sknowledge and trans through it.
But even in that daily across that daily had such an experience.
You will also know it ourselves, that sense that there is creative ideas in your recording from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that for brone?
How can we use it without we'll be able to use it?
In a way that is good for us.
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is a big part of his lifetime of the contemporary artist of the power, which is trying to get out of all power in the uncontrol creative impulsable creative impulses in him.
With the years, Tom was a little rusty.
And one day he saw in Los Angeles over the front, and changed the process.
while he heard so he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to him, as inspiration that is a cwell.
It was a beautiful melods and he wanted to hold the fashion.
But it wouldn't.
He had no paperat, no paperecorder.
And the well-known excitement again, "I love the melodds of the celody eterness, and then it keeps me behind me.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
And he didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something.
And he looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, can't you see that I'm behind the sense I set down?"
"Do you really think I'm able to write a song?
And if you really want this song, you have to do that, you have to address if I have time for you.
Don't do anyone else.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Coh." And from that moments lose process.
And the work itself, with the same dark of dark supply show.
But the heavy excited the creative process in the creative process in him.
And the genius, the genius was on the skin and supply just up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go through it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and the actual aspect aspect of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of work.
I already having a profine of it.
I was sitting in the middle of Ets, Bidden, Bide.
At a moment, I agree in despair.
You know that you don't want you to do not good and you think it gets a horrible disaster. The worst book. The worst book.
Not just just bad, you know, really horrible bad.
I wanted to do all the project whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was reminded to his genius, and I also decided to way.
I wonder from my manuscrips and focus crips and directly to a empty corner of the room.
And I said, "Lister then, "Look, we know all of that if this book is not only brilliant me.
You can see that I have everything in me.
I can't give you a lot of them.
If you think it's better, you have to get better than you have to get your thing.
Right? Do you can't do that.
I just write because that is now my work.
Oh, and in the notimate that you have to be distincludes on office."
Tja--- eventually it comes up here.
Remembers came up in the North African desert people together to catch months to month, for months.
and hours and hours and hours, to the morning.
And that was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, something.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know whatever I mean, you know what I mean, you've ever seen something like a performer.
And it was as though time and the dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night, but now.
And suddenly not just a human.
In him, above him, above him.
A godddling him.
And if something that happened to knew people what it was Dan they began to clap them to clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historical fact, when Moren South South South Spain South Spain this way.
And the spoke is the eterness of the centuries of "Allah" in "Allah," Allah," Allah."
And you hear that you hear the day of flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If an artist in Spain a something impossible or magically: "Allah, oil, oil, One, One, Allah, great, Allah, great.
And it's a glimpse of God.
Just what we need.
Lasty is the dancer that the dance of dancing morning to explore the next morning of 11 in the morning of the morning is not the god-size.
At that moment he is again, a little elder guy with cnees that may never come up to such more to such up.
Perhaps never calls anybody elsewhere.
What does it have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really difficult for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be so painful.
Imagine that you're not going to be the most unusual aspects of your person.
Imagine you believe that you have a time.
When you are finished to someone else.
This is how it consists everything.
I'm going to hang that though.
And the last months I've been working on a book that will short. The book that short. And the book where many too long.
The follower of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me on the hand, I love and I love me the same.
Do just your work.
You just do thing, whatever it is.
If you are too dancing, thank you.
If the dival genius that you've been allowed to leave in your work at some amazing source something of the amazing source, then "Okay!"
Don’s not, thank you only go.
And then "Okay!"
I believe that I believe that.
"Okay, anyway!" because we stay out of pure human love and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: OK!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genome.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology of digitalizing the digital code and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology and synthetic and synthetic of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels.
We've tried different approach, it bringing back to the minimal components.
We're almost 20 years.
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the biology world of the biology world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask question: can we regenerate, or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can get to smaller.
We can catch in the order of hundred from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolic map, that relatively simple compared to the so.
To me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch, it's very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell.
So we decided that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions. And so we could take the components to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we have a chromosome synthesese?"
Do the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we can a chromosome of the chromosome "meet?
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way.
So, the tempo of the digitize of digitalizing exponential way.
Our capability to write the genetic code rather slow-slowly slow-slow-side.
And our final point it would take places on an exponential curve.
We're starting here over 15 years ago.
There were a couple of stages for a bio-ethic accethical apply to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA, 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it pieces.
So we had to add a new method for together these little pieces and core the core of all mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the pieces --
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of a little piece of chemical piece in the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the genetic code and viral particles.
And the viral particles were taken out of the cells, they came back and they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but all too well.
They laughed more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes on the size of viruses, so we could pull the cassettes various --
to understand what the actual components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you starts with digital information in the computer than must be very accurate.
When we first gain this genome for the first time was in 1995, the default, the default of a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found after resequencing. If we had 30 mists. When we had the original sequence than it was not able to start.
My of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be surface with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so doing smaller sub-to-unities that we have to design so that they can go together.
We're design unique parts.
Maybe you have read that we stop.
You know, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, Gand T.
Trios of those letters code for roughly 20 aminozurs -- that there's an amazing appears for every aminoxyoxioxyoxi.
So we can use the genetic code to write words.
We are only signature signature --
Some of them had no poems that there were no poems.
We've designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we began to make pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters, who were five to 7,000 letters long, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, and then 2,000.
In every stadiumber, we knew a abundance of these pieces so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust -- that will be very robust --
We're trying to reach the point of automatization.
So this looks like a basketball.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow so easy more in E. coli.
And that explains the most of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanises.
We knew a mechanism that "homologic recombination, which is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA.
Here's an example of this.
There is an organism called Deinococococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radio radiation.
And you can see that in the upper panel, in chromosome of the chromosome from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he put it back together.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dried up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be living in space that can be able to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of this.
Here is a realm micro-photograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually, just yesteriod mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did.
Gesterns it cartomatically.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph. This is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken over a six seconds.
This is the publication that we recently.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we were going to take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, there is 142 pages just to express the genetic code.
All right, how do we get a chromosome of a chromosome of it?
With a virus is clearly pretty easy.
With a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give your eukaryots, as well, you just know: you know, you just know the cell and does another in, and that is what you know as well.
At the bacteria species of chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome transplant transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another, and can activity.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micromosome of the micromosome of the micromosome of a micromosome of micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of the micromosome of a chromosome of the micromosome of the micromosome of a chromosome
These are about this is about as far as people and mic.
We added some extra little extra so we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of these chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of these chromosome extra lot of extra lot of extra little extra little extra
We have response to create all the protein to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you'll be able to the very advanced graphic pictures here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
And we thought, we thought he would come, but we tried to develop the process some process.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
And we discovered all kinds of these kinds chromosome of third chromosome of third chromosome of thousands of characteristics in a species.
People that evolution evolving evolution as though there are not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restrict enzymen are called DNA.
The chromosome of the chromosome was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of the chromosome of it.
It became express and it recognized the other chromosome as strange material, and so we had the eventually got the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome as stly material --
He was blue from the genes that we had it.
And in very short time disappears all the characteristics of one species, and changed in the new software that we stop in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code, it was exactly where it was changed.
And this may sound as genomic alchemistry, but we are in fact, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changing things.
Good, I've been paying that this is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is front boards at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paying evolution, and maybe we have almost a new version of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosian explosion of the Camban explosion of the Cambban explosion of this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what's needed.
We're going to deal of six-and-a-half billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for every one of us who lived in 19466; within 460 years.
We have trouble with food, with the care of clean water, drugs, burning for the six-and-half billion.
It's hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of coal, more than 30 billion lion.
That's 100 miloons of lions a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than any process than to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
Then there is all that carbon dioxide of the dioxide.
And by all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a death different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We are constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of technique synthesesemethods of combination genomics.
We've got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or try to optimize processes to optimize processes to produce or drugs, new vaccines, then we can change with a little team of team, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbular, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a sharing imagination of what real design software where we work, so you can actually go and make a new kind of a new kind of on the computer.
We don't know person to look like it.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We focus on fourth generation.
Is you have seen to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second generation and third generation fuel that will come out of sugar, to more higher fuels like sugar, to more higher fuels as octanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influences without the food price higher and the availability to lay as we start with CO2 as his food, and so we are just starting with CO2 as his food supposed to design that way, and we think that the first generation.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the depth of the deep, about 2.5 kilometers deep, with temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with the help of molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at whether we can take the CO2, which is easily through pipate to factories that CO2, where that CO2 to send the CO2, to send this process.
So in a short, in a short, we think we are able to expanding the basal question, "What is life?"
We really know -- you know -- you know -- the protect of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where?
A major energy source.
But we also work to use these tool servaccines of these tool servaccines.
This year was the flu, we just just just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
And I think that can change from textomorrow.
Here you see how the future can see because the evolution tree is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still far away of improving people.
Our purpose is that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive for long enough to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a little bit quickly the fundament of a new technology that we brought to go to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it is an environment in which you can local or at the distance with immense amounts of visual data.
We're looking at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can be able to keep down there, and challenge and challenges to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at it, how big these collections are or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs of the Library of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel
And it all makes nothing because it would be affected to affect the amount of pixels on the screen of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, which is an example data.
This is the graug house through Dickens. Each column.
To point that it is really textest is textest and no imagination, we can do something, to show that this is really textile -- this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read an e-book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic example. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning.
And this gives you the fun, and the experience of a real paper magazine or newspaper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also did something with the corner.
We've made an advertisement of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the opportunities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen.
We hope that this doesn't mean this pop-ups and other blue flaul -- not neet.
Of course the maps are maps a crowd application for a technology like this one, I'm not going to spend here, except that we can contribute to this field, except that we can also contribute a lot of contribution as well.
These are all roads in the U.S.
On the top of the NASA.
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is Photosynth, those two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other thing is a very beautiful pieces research by Noah Snavely, proven to the University of Washington the University of Washington.
and Rick Sseliski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's been made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, that we can see the images of images, and the multiresolution resolution.
The space of the pictures of the images.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images, so that they recommended with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genome, and all of these things are stabilized images.
I don't know sure whether there is other environments.
There are still a lot of space.
And I'd like to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summer, which is the actual force of the engineering power of this enough force of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to do it with the lawyers and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for images from Flickr, and you get images of people in t-shirts, and the campus, and the campus and the campus and so on.
And each of these orange chests a picture of image that model.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are all copied in this way.
And we can do at simple way to navigate.
You know, I never thought I would never work at Microsoft.
It's overwhelmed to be so extend to be.
I believe that you can see that these many types cameras, everything from guntil reflexcameras, a major number of it, a great number of them, a big number of it,
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much covered by facing faces and things like that.
And somewhere between a series of photographs -- here they are.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churged by the program.
If we dive the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
And what we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- of the entire collective memory of the entire collective memory that everything to each other.
All these photographs become together, and shapes a little bigger than the sharing of the parts.
You then have a model that comes from the entire Earth.
This as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it as it uses and also the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own photographs of metap-data that somebody else.
And if someone would like someone would like to climb and their names and their names, then my photograph of the Notre Dame is suddenly that data, and I can use as an access to the space, that metape versuggests of every photographs, and created this kind of cru-model, and created social experience.
And of course, is the bad-product virtual model of this virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which is not only from air photographs, satellite images and other applications.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible, in the next year, in the next years, all the images that can be did, all the images that can cope to the world together.
BA: Yeah: Yeah.
And it creates to your wish: hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the images.
And that gets are exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of these pictures.
When you look at the web page of images, you feel a search in, and the text on the webpage on the webpage of information about what the picture.
What if now, the image couple of your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that comes out of that. It's a classic network effect. It's a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible.
One of the intense places of traveling and of enographic research is the potential to life between those who are not forgovernment, who don't feel in the wind, that their past.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky axy, or that the mythes of Inexcitement is still traveling with meaning in the Himalaya bunch of Dharma, you remember of Dharma, you remember of the anthropology: the world in which we live in the anthropology: the world in which we live in an absolutely but is not just one of the truth, but is not just one of the true of the work,
the consequence of an applying choices that takes our ancestors of generations.
Of course, we all share the same requiremen: Words born. Brenes kids in the world.
We're all making inforcritics.
Againing with the intent separation by death.
So it can't be surprise that we all all of these things and art.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song and the rhythm in every different culture.
Or now, this is the Penan in the wolds on Borneo, or the Vood acolites in Haiti, or the U.K. Caisut in North Kaisut in North Kaisut, the Curandero in the Andes-bunch of the Sahara. This is the Caravanai in the Sahara. This is the angmas with the instinside of Quoman of Quomangma, on of Q. on the Qenomangma,
Everest, the gods of the world.
They're all that we can believe that we can think, differently.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea you can only give you hope.
Samming the intelligence cultures in the world a web of spiritual and culturally life that the planet, and the planet, and the biological life web, the biosphere.
And this cultural life web you can imagine as an event.
The etnosed feet you can define as the totally of all the thought, myths, myths, myths, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations and intuitions that are consciousness.
The etnosing is the major nalization of humanity.
She is the symbol of all that we can be as amazingly, as amazing curious animal species.
Like the biosphere is the equivalent is the etnosing -- and still in much bigger mate.
No biologist, a biologist, you know, at least half of all kinds of all species on the point of extinct, because that simply is not true.
And this is the most optimistic scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss.
When everyone was born born there, there were six-thousand languages.
A language is more than her word or her grammatical rules.
A language is a refer of the human soul.
It's the vehicle of the soul of every unique culture.
Every language is a century, a century, a separation, an ecosystem to spiritual an ecosystem to spiritual opportunities.
From that six-six-thousand the day of no longer in children are following in children.
They're not taught babies longer.
Effectively means that unless a change.
Is there anything to be held by being held by silence, the last of your environment, the last of your language, no chance of the ancestors of the ancestors of the kids?
And recient that term is somebody on the Earth, every two weeks, every two weeks, because every two weeks, there is an older and dying the last letter of an old language of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, wouldn't be a better place, if we were all better place, if we would speak all the same language. I say, "Super, let's take Yoruba, Or Kantones. Or Kantones. Or Kantone.
Or Kogi.' You suddenly realize how it could not speak your language.
So what I want to do today is to take you on a short journey by the et, which has to create a picture of what is really lost.
And many of us forgotten that when I have a different way of being in a different way.
Take this Barasana-child in the Northern Amazone, the people of the anaconda, the anaconda, that she believes out of following the galaxy of the eye in the tube.
This is a bunch that cognitive the colors of blue and cognitive the cognitive of the odd amazing of the oerforest, which is dependent.
They have a regular language marriage, which is called linguistic exogample, you have to married somebody who speaks a different language.
These are roots in the mythological past, but it extraordinarily in their houses, where six or seven languages, where six or seven language, but you never hear someone a language.
They listen to simply speaking.
One of the fascinating, and one of the fascinating, the Waorani in North Ecuadorani in Northern Ecuador, an amazing.
In 1957, five missionaries five missionaries, but they made a critical error.
Of the air friendly friendly photographs of themselves to our ideas, in which they have never seen this completely had never seen a two-dimensional pictures of itself.
They got the photos and tried to find the shape behind the face behind the face.
When they found anything, concluded, they concluded that the pivel out there, and then the device.
But the Waorani not just outside.
544 percent of their deaths came out of the boardy.
We were able to eight generations back to eight generations back to eight generations, where we found two cases of a natural death.
When we wondered, they gave that one person ever died, one of the amazing of the amazing of the own. But at the same time. But at the same time. But at the same time, at the same time.
Their hunters, their hunters were removing distance and telling which animal kind of it was.
Begin '80s, I got an amazing emergency, when my professor I was asked to me if I wanted to go to Haitii to inmove secret that the basis of presidential power of presidential of presidential Duvalues that the basis on the presidential elitors that it safe and so the summer.
To of these sensational things, I had to learn what to do, I had to learn something about this particular, which is not a black magic.
It's an entirely metaphysical worldview, very interesting.
Would I ask you the major religions, which would you say it?
Christiendomislam, laddhism, jodence, etc.
One continent is always consistent, from the assumption that Africa had no religious belief had no religious belief had no religious belief, they had this.
Voodoo is simply the destily of this profound religious religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during death during the slavery,
What voodoo is so interesting is the living relationship between the lives.
The lives, the minds.
And the minds can be added from the Great Great the dancing of the Great the dancing soul of the living timate time, so during that one becomes the following moment to the follow.
And that's why voodistics degree: "You're going to talk to the church and God.
We dancing in the temple and God." And because you're so consciously by the mind, what can you happines?
This leads to a amazing tourselves in trance that journey-to-follows in trance.
This demonstrates the opportunity of the mind to influence the body to affect the body is extreme when this is extreme is extreme is extreme is extreme when this is extreme is extreme when this is extreme.
Of all the people that I've ever lived with the Kogi is the most extraordinarily -- a lot of the north of Colombia.
And stem of the Tairona-civilization, which ever the Cariban Cariban Colombian Colombia are population in the neash of the distory.
They're going to go back into an isolated.
And in a blood continent, only this was followed by the Spainting.
Another is increased by ritual pries' training but the training to priester is pretty extraordinary.
And the young acolites are hurried to their families as they are three or four or four there.
They're defined in a world of darknis, in stonishing stones to add glaciers, 18 years.
Two periods of nine year, consciously chose to months form the nine months that they bring into the shoot of their mother.
Now they are evidence of speaking in the major mother.
These entire time. These entire time they get the common values that are connecting the cosmic or ecological or ecological or ecological or ecological or ecologicical.
This invention ends up with the day, that they were suddenly, and the first time in their life, if they're 18 in their lives, if they're 18 moment of consciousness of consciousness of the first body of consciousness with her light from the wonderful landscape with her light translator that they have taughters. The pries: The pries: The priess. And the priesters saying in the entirely of the first time,
"You see? It's like I said you've been saying.
This is how beautiful is to protect this too protection." They call themselves the older brothers.
We are the younger brothers, who are responsible for the destruction of the world.
At this point, it's very important.
And if we think about inhearing and landscape and our landscape and we often Rously and the old factor, a idea that racistic in his simple wild, a idea that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we get Thoreau to and Thoreau are following closer to the Earth stop on the Earth stop --
Inheems are no sentimental nor expected by nostalgion.
For both is very little space in the malaria moerass of the Earth has been in the ice winds of Tibet. Desallances of Tibet. Desalniance and a traditional mystic of the Earth, which is not consciously, which is based on the idea of the Earth."
What does that mean that means a little child out of the Andes, which has grown up with the belief that the mountain an Apu-mind that his or her found, a fundamental other relationship and a other relationship to that set out of Montana, which is going to have a little kid with the idea that the mountain.
Or it the lives of a mind or a bunch of it.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines defines the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests.
And that made me a different human beings of the Kwagiults of the Kwagiults that those forests are the forests of Kuxwhukw and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel and the Kromme Snavel and the Kuxiles of the world.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-education.
And if you begin with the idea that these cultures different realities can be able to get different realities for some of their extraordinary discovery. Take this plant. Take this plant. Take this plant.
It's a photograph that I april in the North Wast-Amazone nam.
This is ayhuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayhuascinating makes so fascinating, is not just the pharmacological potential, but how fascinating it is built from two sources.
And therefore there is a wood-carboline, harmine and harmaline and harmaline and harmaline hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating.
If you take only the plant plant it seems that a blue crazy through your consciousness.
The plant is mixed by a coffee of a coffee beat, Psychotria viral ridis.
The plant runs powerful tryptamines, narrative resenserotonine, dimethyltry-ptamine, 5-methoxyltry-ptamine.
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they that snuts, that substance of different kinds of different kinds of methoxydimethyptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami methoxy ever of the Yanomami ptami --
And that powder your nose in bladers, you know, the crazy pictures, paintor pictures, to be paintings on a sea of electricity. This shipping is not the creation of reality.
I was trying to convince my professor, Richard Evan -- a guy who did the psychedelical aged the psychedelic agets in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryes were not to identify as hallucinating as hallucinating, because when the effect is impurposed to the hallucination. Tryptamines. Tryptamines are not to take the hallucination.
They're only able to be ingenoms with something that the monoamine of it does impact.
And the fascinating is that the beta-carbolines in the gang monodial monoamine-suppressing the tryptamine-ptamine-ptamine-engineered species of 80,000 planets of 80,000 plants of two morphological variant species that combind a biochemical variant of the parts of the parts that are larger than the shake of the parts of the partomore?
We say eufemistic "trial and ror," which is going to be recognize.
And the Indians say: "The plants talked to us. What does that? This tribe, the Cofan, knows the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuasca, who can identify all the major distance of the eyes that would be as one species.
If you ask their taxonomy to map their taxonomy in map, they say, "I thought you know something.
You know? I said, "No." I said, "No."
And it turns out, you can hear all the 17 species in a night in a night in a night,
You're not a piece of Harvard, but it's a piece of bunch a piece bigs.
Now, the problem is that even those of us that sympathics under us that sympathic completely and colorful as curious and color and colorful in the history of history as the real world.
The truth is that the 20th century is not going to be reminded to be the wars or technological innovations, but rather as the age of the age that we stone, and active participears or passive participears to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem not change.
All cultures have always been sharing a dance with new life opportunities.
Technology is not the problem.
And the Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux -- when they gave their pile and treatment, just as much as that Americans stop Americans, when they stop their horse and ways.
It's not changed or technology that the integrity of the eventually threat. It's power. It's power. It's power.
The writing face of the government.
Where you also look at the world, you'll notice that it's not the fate of these cultures.
These are dynamic living following existence is identified by identified by identified by their applications.
Whether this is a huge forestation in the home of the Penan, a nomadic Southeast Asian ar-disch Southeast Asian atically ended up to the forest, and living the forest living and prostitution to the River service and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see that the river of Borneo -- where you can see that the river of Borneo for the Borneo Chinese South Chinese Zeight, where you can look for the re.
to fill their ships.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that got inside of the discovery of discovery of discovery of discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical challenge of a completely universal rejudge of a people, but the destruction of a people, not just divide of a people, is not just divide as part of a developing strategy as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level.
I have a young colleague 9,000 kilometers over the country from Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
It was when I came to Lhasa in Lhasa face behind the statistics that you hear about.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
On the basis on that he was killed directly when the Chinese invasion.
His flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which brought the people to Nepal.
His mother prison was prison because she was rich.
He was the prison the prison the prison when he was two was hidated until in her call.
And the sister that held so held smokle in a reflection skamp call.
And one day she got to be accidentally, on a poor of Mao. For this reattracted seven years. And for seven years.
And the pain of Tibet can be wrong, but the free of the people.
And eventually it comes up on a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of simply or want to live a colorful world of diversity?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that we directioned that we direction.
We would not only see the human imagination constrained to a small, model, but also we would be able to expect and forget that there are other options.
We can feel our feel at the idea that our kind of only 15,000] years.
The Neolitic Revolution, which is the Neolitic Revolution, where we gave to the cult of the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the proshaman by the proza specialization of the priests and we found a specialization by the proshaman was only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is no 300 years.
This surface is not gives me the idea that we don't have the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that the next millennia on our path.
And if the intelligic cultures of the world to be asked the meaning of people, they answers to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that song that we are going to discover the opportunity to be what we are, a conscious species that everything in the work and all the gars and all the gards and all the gardens of optimism.
This photograph I've taken at the northern point of Baffin Island, when I went up with Inextently in the narwal --
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inext, in the 1950s. And in the 1950s. And in the 1950s.
The opa of Olayuk the Olayers.
And the family of peace for his life and record him already all his cars, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the col; they use it to use it.
The glass of their sleepers was originally made of fish in caribs.
Olayuks from the guy was not afraid for the poolnight or the storm that reach.
And he went out, he showed his greenhouse business, and he was poeped in his hand. When the Poop began to woman, he had it as a limmet.
And he brought a low-play on the sides.
When it was solid, he slaught a dog with it.
He had the dog and improvised a hearnas.
Of the riban he made a sled.
And he was a dog in the neighborhood, and he disappeared, including poems.
Over with nothing. And this is a lot of far, in many ways, in many ways, the state of the Inin and all the inine of the Inin and all the impacts of the world.
In april 19999 gave the Canadian government the Inin the entire of a piece of country bigger than California and Texas is our new home. It's called Nunavues.
It's independent. They're independent.
It's an amazing example of how a nation state,
And finally, I think, I think it's clearly, at least for whom to these uithoes of the world is required, that they actually don't get away.
They're somebody's home.
They're going to go from the human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of time. And for all of the time. And for all of us all the dreams of these kids, just as the one, part of an undefined geograph.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely the idea that politicians never reached anything.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic is not convincing the world, but we believe that storytells the world, that we probably the best tellers in the world, and our website is 35 million times a month-sharing in 156 countries on TV and our magazining our magazine public.
We make a fold to travel to the eat the eating, with our audience, with our public, to such extraordinary place, in such extraordinarily by what he can see, so hope by what he see: hopefully the major openation of the anthropology will be able to live in a multiculation in a way that we can find a way to live in a multicultural and pluralistic world
that all of all the people's wisdom of all the people.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book that I have a book that I have a book --
Maybe you can see parallel with information from other sources.
I'm also trying to explain some sense that you might have been telling you that you might have been meant to you.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly the official dogma of all the Western industrialized society.
And that official dogma is follow: To shall of our neighbors on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is an essential part of the human existence.
Freedom of freedom is going to be able to acting a higher which is to reach a higher well.
And the ultimate freedom.
More choices that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically.
This is so deeply in our society that nobody would read to it.
Even in our lives is this dogma.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A resource group.
Even about dressings.
By that 175, 175 chances are threats in my supermarket, there are in my supermarket, and then extra-virgin the supermarket.
And then you can make a bunch of your own threat, for the case between those 175 species for you.
So this is the connection of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can get your stereoset -- loud speakers, cash player, cassettesh.
At one electronicawincle, you can choose out of this number.
You can put six-and-a-half million different systems, with parts from that store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
another example -- communication.
When I was young, long ago, you could ask all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You hurt it up. You won't bought it.
And that was the advantage that the advantage.
And that time.
Today, there are a lot of different statement.
Especially in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with behind player and crusher and crush.
Don't seen this model you haven't seen this model, but you can be sure that that's happening.
And the result, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do.
Also in aspects of life that are much more important than the attend of stuff, this explosive explosive increase of choice.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States in the U.S. that you have to go to the doctors and you tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and it says, "We can do A, or we can do, or we can do.
A front this front and down.
BB has this front, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dekter, what do you like this?"
And the doctor saying, "A has this front, and B has this front and down.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you were doing me, what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not."
And we call that "own inputs of the patient."
And it sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decision, of someone who devices -- the doctor -- the doctor, someone who is freezing and not the best condition to take decisions, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient.
Good considered that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy it.
Why advertising, if we can't buy it?
Because they think that we think that the next morning our doctor our doctors to ask that other brand ask that other brand measure.
Our identity, yet, yet an engineering aspect of our existence, is now regulated to choices, as you can see.
Our identity is capable of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we just want.
Everybody morning, you have to think about some person you have to think what person you want.
Let's talk about marriage, the family.
There has been a time that free everybody's automatically: you can married so quickly, and then it could be married to children.
The only choice was the only choice with who, not when and what you did.
Now is free everything for it.
I teaching at particularly intelligent students, which I was event less house work.
They're not sumer or not dommer than in the early time.
No, they have pressure with choices.
"Well I married or now? Is I now?
Or will I wait? Take first kids, or a career or a care?"
These are everything to ask questions.
They're going to have an answer, as it means that they don't get all their homework and not a good number.
And they have right. They're important life questions.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just that technology is allowing us to work. Carl every minute of every day. Carl every minute -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There is one place, which I love secret I love secret --
I don't walk like that, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, that huge choicy choicy of work in that we are incredibly wonder, or whether we're going to work, or now.
We can look at a football of our son, with our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other hand.
And even if they're all out of these things are going to be a minute of that compete with all sorts of questions, "Am I answer this phone answer?
I write this email, I write this letter? Is I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "No." And we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, materialistic business style, life style of choos: life is a question of things.
This is how the world looked like.
There were a little choices, but not everything was a issue of choos;
And so the world looks like this.
The question is, Is this good or bad?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about it is, so I'm going to talk about it.
And that enormous choice has two effects on the human beings, two negative effects on human.
A very contradiction is that it works rather than confreedom.
With so many choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I'm going to give you a very dramatic example of that, a research of investments in volunteers.
A colleague of me had access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a great policy with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fees.
They discovered that for every decades that for every decades that employed, the particular two percent.
At five-frombers did 10 percent less employees than five percent less employees than five and five foundses. Why?
Because it founds at five-foundly to choose that people just choose choice to choose the choice to the next day, and it up, and so on.
And from expower.
It doesn't mean not just that that people after their retions don't have a dream of food because they don't have enough money, but also that the choice knowledge, but also the choice knowledged that they have to shoot the employed of it.
and they went to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year.
The working was willing was willing to double.
So too many choicy can be paralyzing together.
And I think the world looks like this.
If it goes to the eternals, you want to make very much like to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be wrong with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we, also if we agree the lamming of our and choose, eventually less peacked with the result would be if we had less options.
There are multiple reasons for that.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example.
You're such a case for that a different choice to be better choice.
This dried alternative alternatively for that you get out of your choice.
And spots of the choice of the choice that you've been a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
And the more options, the more option, the more responds of the responds of that else element.
A second reason has a substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave gave all of how often we depend the value of things that we depend up to the things that we are similar.
If you think of many alternatives, you can also see many alternatives of all alternatives of all alternatives.
And that makes that you have challenge with the alternative that you have chose.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers below, my excuses.
This is a little bit of this example.
This issue is in the Hamptons.
They've got an expensive secondwing.
They're on a beautiful strand. Stralend again.
Don't do it? "Lastonish," thinks that man, "It's austy.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city.
I could car, my car for the door.
And he's sitting two weeks, with the idea that it every day.
And substitution costitution cost of the enough we have our choice, even if we make an amazing choice, even if we make an amazing choice.
And the more possibilities are, the more attract alternatives.
And those are presenting us as a substitution costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in here and now for example, and you don't have to do things.
Another point is that you look with every choice other choice.
And all that other has so his attractivities.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this, I came up to a new bottom for a new bottom.
I walk almost always judgment.
It was only one kind of stuff was only one kind of stuff, and you couldn't go and thank you very much, it's incredibly uncomfortunately uncomfortable, but if you were working and often enough and fur.
And after years I went to the store for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff, this is my me."
And the maller said, "Welt you smart fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you want to buy or a rhyth?
Do you want to leave an effect?
Do you can walk something, or flink, or fline." And so he went out of pipal." And so he went on.
I was there. And I was a while I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want the only one."
And he had no idea which was not an hour, and so I have an hours all possible.
In fact, I remember the store eventually eventually explored with an explored breet.
And I had better. Though I could do it better, I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To explaining, I wrote this for myself, I wrote a book.
And the reason I don't feel better with all that choice, was that I started expected to expect of the fasts of a good stuff.
I began without any any expectation, because I only only only only one kind of speaking.
And then it turned out that there was different and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so compared my bottom with my expectations, and that asked me.
And the more possibilities people have the deserve more expectations that they celebrate about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less peace with results, even if it's good results, even if it's good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And it really goes up about that.
Everything was better when everything.
Because when everything was bad, people could have a lot of surprising experience.
In our modern society, in our modern society citizens, but the best citizens, but the best thing we can ever reach, is something so good as good as well as we were expectancy as well.
Never we get touch, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- the secret of this -- the secret of happiness.
I want to be here -- a car biographic elementally -- I was a woman who is really fantastic elementally fantastic.
I don't put me with her under with her less rate.
But with less enough takes are good sides.
And finally, when you get a bad breeding bought a bad breedombs as there is only one kind of predict, you can ask why you are intendency.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different available, and you buy it turns out, who's responsibility?
The answer is, the answer is just so simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of severe, you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decided to decide even though the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society, celebrating clinical depression under the younger generations.
A factor -- not the end, but a significant factor, but a significant factor at this explosive increasingly depression and suicide suician experience of their high expectations.
And then they are trying to explain to explain itself, they give themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettores: The nettoress, so that we go on the objectively on it.
Again, a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody.
But that's not.
It wasn't a doubt that can choose better than can choose be better than not able to choose it is more choice.
There is a magic boundly choices of choices, I don't know.
But I know that we are already for a long time.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best one.
The choice in industrialized countries comes out of materialized countries out of material overfluence.
There are lots of places on the world, and we have already heard about, where the problem is not too much that there is too many choice, but it's too few choice.
So the paradox that I'm talking about here for the moderne, so that I think for the moderne, well.
That's frustrating, and this is frustrating, and you won't told you that expensive and hard to install kinds of kids are not helping kids are not helping from your money.
I tell you the same about this pursuit -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they don't help to help up: they found.
They make our living.
As a part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to be transmitted to all those choices that people have to go forward.
Even our lives on it.
That's what economists and a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better off by revertation of well-to-only poor people -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the choice that we are with us.
First of all, if you read this sculpture, you'll say, "Ah, what knows that fish, what knows that fish?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scrace imagination, a brief image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you get the fishing to create potential to create possibilities, you have no freedom.
If you get the fishing potential to create possibilities.
It leads to more paralyzing and less peace.
Everybody has a fish.
This is free certainly definitely even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the absence of a figurous fissue of a figure.
Thank you for your attention.
