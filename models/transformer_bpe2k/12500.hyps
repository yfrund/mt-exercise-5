And I was a year I showed these two dia's slip that the pool, who had the pool, who had the last three million years of the vastate of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States,
But this is the such of this specific problem because it doesn't show the animals because it doesn't show the ice.
The ice ice of the North Pole, in a sense of the North sense of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summit in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide that I shows is a version of what the last last 25 years is happening to the last 25 years is happening to the last 25 years of what happened was happening.
The permanently is approach.
As you see it from dark it from dark blue.
That's the year, the deattention of the winter.
And the shamp in the summer
The solizing permanent, five years or parent, is almost like blood is almost like blood and it is slowed in the body is slows.
In 25 years is the from this to this is the seeing of this is to this one.
And that's a problem because the foot is the North Icelerate Icrafy and there is a very big neighborhood in a very big neighborhood and carbon and making micror is is immediate, when it was contained by microm,
And the totale of the totality of the totality of the atmospher, that could be double, if we reflect it if we described it as we surround.
In some undeepe undeepe in Alaska brearely methane in Alaska in the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter from Alaska another team to a different team to a different deep impact more.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is that will be able to be able to be that will be be there.
A reason for that, this is that this huge called "warmer Greenland from the north of the north of warming warms.
This is a smell muscle atriver.
The waterer's watervent more than anything.
This is the Kangerlussian suac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea is because it's the agriculture, it's the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea.
These stroming these stroms.
And the other side of the planet of the planet on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the maonth month of scientists scientists that the entire continent to a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the icequipal is the South Pole, with the South Pole, with name of the underwatertain the underwaters.
The whole continent to six meter seespiece of seeing in the Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the size mass ice ice ice mass and a few years ago, who were a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his drink water from the squatching water from that smell time.
In the Andes, is this glestyer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappearing it is the drink water.
In California was a reducation of 40 percent in the Sierra.
It comes out in the water reservoires of the waterreservoics.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions --
This global dreaming dreamount of a dramatical style of bos' fuel of fuel
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with a unbelief, and never see face and never seen seen a faster quickly fasts.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years, in the forward 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeep unkeep unkeep unkeep unkeep is unpreser.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 ain CO2 hours --
25 miles every day in our oceans, every day in our oceans, Kook at the eye area from America, from America, away from America, we have been from America, and every single sile of the Indian substance, there is a behavior in the oceans.
The only big causes of the earth, the earth, which is the single of the earth, which is 20 percent of phossil fuel of phossil fuel of phossil fuel of phossil fuel of the earth,
Olie is a problem, and steenk is the very largest problem.
The United States, one of the two size is one of the two sizes together.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more city-carbon centrales.
But we see a commeasure.
These are the cities of carbon centrales where the ban was annuted in the last years, and where green alternatives,
There's a political streeding on the political streedom.
The urban carbon and oil industiry gave 250 million dollars to promotion, 250 million dollars to promots, what a opportunity is a surpried.
And that picture of something thinking.
And the guy was the church in Tennessee, about four billion literally support literally belied.
You have seen it probably in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the value in the news of the valuable.
This is the one after single size.
This was happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising lines of the cities of the cities.
Video: """Prosty the voice, the city's crochad, a guy challenge of challenges.
He's fluence here in America, and he cars in America, and he cars for that our economy.
Frosty the cities of carbon the day.
He's paid and scattle, and employed their bity."
Here's a big part of the citen's steenched in West Virginia from daan.
The largest mine is the great bad of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship of the Dones me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, Harry Rewon't know where they haven't know about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimating protection two campaigns on your tom.
This is a piece of a them.
Fideo "Bue COAL, we see the climate change, as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a giant consider to the light to the light and it bringing the light and it retrolessing the truth of city-carbon city.
Feit is, steenkool is not smart.
We find that the shop, and it is a little bit of the cooking.
So, you don't get you to climate change.
Let that only on us.
Video: Acteur: Schone steenks, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern scow of scow coal centrale.
Fantastic. The machines make the machines are pretty much of the machines --
But that's the sound of sound cool.
And despite the fact that the branes of cities that the most important causes of the most important warming warming the Earth, the opportunity of the Earth, the operation that you see all here.
Look a look at the shoot carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: Stem: America is the economy, the economy, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red is the rowed of all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of photographs and imported oile collalay.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
Fore America of 100 percent of salculture is about 10 years.
A plan to America to get to the work of the work on the work and the region, a plan and the operate warming warming the Earth's operate represent.
And in fact, a solution that enough enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our tape of the
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Well, it's about America to give America to give America
One of the speech ways to make a end of the old ways to our dependence of old fuel that our planet to help our planet to help seet.

Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African's old African old African's saying, "If you want to be fast everything else to be everything else.
If you want to go to to collabor."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reward back to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am now, I think of the who don't waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever entrement, 27 miles in engineering in enomb.
It has to nabope the engineering that were less than a billions that were less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, dy!
This is the machine Genevation.
We took pictures of that left of that left in detectors in detectors where I work. It's called the ATLA, detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the presence so you can see the scale.
And at 10 seeptember shapes we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that carefore for a facestimate in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particle that was all around the LHC, who were going to be set up the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was following sharing particles in the detect of the photograph of the LHC,
And in the other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this the largest across the largest across and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet page of saw that the Internet page of saw that the Internet page of saw it so much of saw that the Internet --
That means that we made a cultural as a science impact impact impact impact impact a science impact a cultural impact that we made a cultural impact that we made a cultural as a scientific impact a cultural as a science impact that we made a a cultural impact that we made a a scientific impact
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this golden behavior.
And they were 13 thousand of a thousand of a thousand of power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small be.
They can do that because they can idend his superaged at all the lower temperatural.
So on min 271 degrees of degrees that can be the behaviors that are behaviors that are a birth,
In one of the connective between the neine of the neine in the LHC, was a constructive in the LHC,
And then the wireless was something that was a hearmer, and was an electrical resistance against that 13 thousand ample of amp.
This was the result.
This is another impressive you realize you realize that that magnets more than 20 ton about 30 centimeter were about 30 centimeter works.
We civil about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of stories, what we had to do it.
We all were repaird.
Now they're back to again.
Eind malthy will be the LHC against is the LHC again.
We will take it again and we expect it and we expect it in juni or now, so we can go out with the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe are building the universe are building the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, that have been unhappiness to the debate of the scientific research. It's easily to work.
I think it's hard to see it is hard to be more to go and the fact that we go away from the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientists Humphrey Davy, I think that we have been able to take the conditions of his teachers of his teachers of his teacher's value was the predictation of the human progress of the human mind to the progress of human mind that we have no new imagines that we have not have a mysterious world, that there are not a new mysterions in the nature, and we were no new world,
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to asking you to ask back to your childhood at your childhood at your childhood at your blocks.
When you discovered how to gray it to gray them up and conscious, you were actually problems to learn to the engineering and hands from space and hands of space relationship of space.
Rut, returns out to understand the world to understand the world to us.
If information is information by the physical interactive by the physical interactive interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my adviser Jeeding Calanii -- what was was going to ask me -- what if we were a computer that engineer to ask me -- what kind of engineer is the environmental concontain the way that we could use the individuce with the pes that that we could clay the information with the information of information that we can have the information with the information with the the information with the hands that is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is that that that the ney the ney the ney the ney the ney the ney the ney the ney the ney the ney the best best thing that
and we can be ordering as we want to want to do it?
And these question of us so that we decided to see a answer to build a answer from Siftables.
Cort together together is a Siftable computer is an interactive computer size.
They can be moved with the doctor, they can feel each other and they can feel their movement and they decided a screen and they could be contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be able to graduate the blocks can be moved by graph to gray it up to gray it down to graduate the physical hands.
And the venulions are Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And then this is this high resources a more physical different, and even even from the way of their movement and even even from the way we have to see them new fun interactions of interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video to tell you that it by changing and others and otherset it -- and otherset it played by the other thing is playing.
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indian approach, they will put together, they will interest each each other.
And if they get ringed it and they can be single this and can be single what become single and get some single so.
And they feel movement and hell.
We realized algaw that one of the interesting population of the interacti, the use of the interactive, the use of all of the things like it was a small like it was a small like it was a fluistop.
In this example, three Siftables and I can take them to a color in a color in a very lack color in a very very much of a such color in a little bit of the engineer and I can use them
And if we have focus to go back to the back back to the back back to the back back again.
There are some of the criric possibilities for the education of the education, mathematics and logics that we want to give the possibility to see the possibility and see the outsides, and the outcome, and see the outside immediately immediately see the possibilities.
And here is the developing of a Fibonacci rate from a simple represents of a simple reknowledge program.
And here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single literally gets in every Siftable, and causes in a wordbook.
After about 30 seconds it's very rescue, and differently a new series of a new series of moving opportunity;
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursie to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it and make a video to try and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people need.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and know exactly what to do.
And here are some other people on the tests.
And that's our young best bengineer, right?
And it seems that he was just the Siftables wron.
And for him this was only blocks.
Here's an interactive painted paint.
We wanted to learn a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that carakters of the table.
Here's the sun comes up the sun comes up the sun.
Video: The son comes up there.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
God thought, "Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the needle and the needge can response the carakters with each other -- Video: Wiftoot with each other -- Video: With!
DM: and so his own story;
Video: Helello!
DM: It's a story with a open end of a open end of a open end of a open end of the end of the end of the end of end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of it.
and he decided to see how it way.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example that I will show show Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed recent a sound producing producing a sound producing producing a sound producing product like the lead, bass and pressure prem.
Eengineers, in fact, where you can choose cooky what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use a different variations, which you can see a lot of the variations, which you can choose what you want to use it.
And these sounds can be injected in the Siftables so that you can certain the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the pattern of a Siftable effects like reverb and movable effects like reverb and movie and movie moter.
They are going to be sound to a sound and attached by changing and it through it.
And the other other effects like tempo and evolution, and evolution, that are proposed on the whole pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern of the general effects like tempo and evolution,
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: DM: We begin with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern to a extra lead.
Now, I place the basline --
Video: DM: Well, now I feel what slagwork on it.
Video: DM: And now I copy the movie that I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to affect the effect of the filter of the movie on the effect of the pressure is the effect of the proo.
Video: DM: I can get it all accelerating the cancer of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Well, I read the movie on the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescious, while it is playing.
So I don't have to plann, but I can't improvise everything and improvise and shorter as I want to want to be a little bit more and shorter like I want to do it.
And in the end of the animals of the conversation of the volume Siftable to left the left of the slion.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is my passion from the new people, from the new people, and the way that our brain and body works.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some new element of the engineer possibilities that we developed in the lab.
The dad I want to talk about is that this is only the atsized is just the attage of the interactive medical media, which is the information of digital media, which is the information of our world like we want to do it.
I thank you you from hear.
I look at it from to talk to you to talk to you all of you all of you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life is a long life I was writing from writing and I don't think that ever will change it.
And yet, there is unlanguage something that happened in my life and career, and career, I had to see my relationship with my work on my own relationship with my work on the work of my work to see my relationship and career,
It started a book that I had been unlanguage -- a memoire: "Ets, Biddle, Bids, Beminy, which is very in the whole world of work the whole world of work the world over and international exist.
The sequence is that people are all the way of all and always do it all of the time.
And what -- gets -- getting
People come to me and questions to me and questions you don't know this success you can never be evenaring this succes?
Don't you afraid you will be able to be writing your entire life will never be a book more a book, but never would have to learn to write for warm.
Don't you to do that?"
Erunner -- you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very muty, I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teener -- when I was a teener -- if I was going to be a deal --
People said, "Don't you get success you never get success to be succes?
Don't you afraid for education, that you will be able to suppos?
Don't you know that you live live to this work is going to be something that there is something out of your building, and you will be able to be on the puin of your buildings with your mond bitter-bitter-nes?"
Something in that streeting.
In the short comes to ask me to ask this questions on this questions on this is going to be the questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on this questiions on this questions on this questions on this questions on the questions of this questions on this questions on this questions on this questi
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough.
Also,
But I also think of a lot of other things afraid to know what all of the time.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing to ask myself the last time where that comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logic that somebody is air to be an aight to be able to their mention on Earth?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the gesteship, something that doesn't happen to anything that happens doesn't happen to do anything that happens.
And I take my father. He was shop, and I can't remember my father. And I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was ever given somebody to him that was not afraraid to him that was not afraid to him that was in the 40 years that he was was not remember my father
And so of the "Yohn, how is it with your chemist?"
No, so there was not about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been hold by the century of the century of the century of the study of manic, depressive cohosts --
Scheat, who have a kind of reputation.
Not only writers, other creative people have the reputable to be pretty instable.
Look at the grim of the dead dead of the most magnife creative gests of the 20th century.
Many stierves young, often by own across own across own across own across own across own across own it.
And even the degenes that didn't have to be suicians under their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be seem to be under to be the sweat.
In the last interview for his dead for his dead said, "Mey every of my books is a piece of my books is a multip."
And that's a little bit what to say about your life-life-work.
But from this kind of extincluding this kind of extincluding that we don't look at it.
We all heard it all the earlier and have it all accepted the single of all.
The hemissing dad is that creativity is that creativity is that a poor and that a artistate and that a artistate will leave leads to elelse.
So I want to ask everyone here today you can ask you that idea to the idea of life?
Do you think about that?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think about it now, I think it's not a pretty daught daught in daught --
I think it is the weather sweak it
And even even though dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century is so on.
We can creative gests a lot better attace to life.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to those dark in that dark in the dark of it.
And certainly the fase that my career now.
Go too, I was a saying, amn a saying,
I might be four decades to work on the decades of the decadecades of the decade.
And the Hoostiginious thing is that I now now now the outside world as the work that is followed on that extraordinary book.
And we're here with friends under each other, so I can be able to be well.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think about it is to you think about it and you know it to take neure.
So I don't want to do it.
I love me of a working with the work that I love to the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love to keep the work that I love me of the work that I love me of the work I love me of the work I love to the work I love to the work I love me of the work I love
The question is: "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I am to think of the conclusion that I can just go through the conclusion as I can be a psychological protection in the process ine.
I have to create the writing of the distance of the distance between mitself and my survive and my survival angst for the reactions, in my future public publishes.
I had been looking for the last year, to do that.
I mean, I do in history, and I have done and have me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search a little bit of my old Greeks and Roman and Rom.
Let me because it's a long and including story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Roman and Roman beliefed people that creativity was from henself.
Men belief, that creativity was a godable place that of a distrained place to the human beings came to the human reasonable to the ments of reasons.
The Greeks called this is called this guy of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates beliefed that he had a demon that he had a demoon that had been influistered him --
The Romenon the Romb.
And in them was a consider creative medicative gested a geni."
The gray is that the Roms with a geniy person not a a particular.
In their policy was a genion, a geniy entition that was a magic entition that was in the muren of the poor,
A little bit like Dobs by the house of the house
And if the artistic was the work was the genia --
And he was the shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had to talk about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work --
The artists was so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was not all the eer.
Everybody knew that was that a unvisible geniiion.
With, you know, you read that is not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty unusued genion.
Lange time is that was the Wests creativity was proted.
When the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed
There is a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weather, and attaged from the goddle-over world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual from the individual of the individual
And for the first time in history, there was about artists about artists that they were a genion, and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I think I have to find that a big follow.
And to show one person, one single individual individual is that he or she or she is the secur, the source of the century of the century of everything else -- that's what does is a lot of responsible -- that's something -- that's something that is something -- that's something that is is something that is is something that is is something that is a much for a fraile for a framing for a framing for a fraile of framal human be, the fraile of the fraile of the fragile
Also, or you ask to sit into the sun of sket.
Ego's read to be resisted proporate proporate proporate proportic proportions.
And I think this press the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists of artists --
And if that's so that is, and I think is the question, "What do is the question.
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a old back, on a old understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery mystery mystery mystery mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can make 500 years of rational house not unford in a 18 minutes,
And the third of the audience people who are the scientific people who are about the idea that else is the idea that elphysics with what the work of poor, the work of poor, the work of artists to inspiring higher high-teaching high-teming high-like the work of poor.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you all of you in there,
I ask it to me.
Why not?
Why would we have this thought don't we have this thought don't we have this thought is?
The faster is just so much as much as all the other explaining uncalculation that are contains in the creative process.
Everybody who have to create something to create -- so in fact all the attached of this -- know the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational ace.
And that sometimes it was almost paranorms.
I have unlanguaged the great American closer Ruth Stone of the American closer States.
And they are close in the neintive. And all of life they did.
She told me about her youth on the plattelevision of Virginia.
Sometimes when she was on the foot of the work was felt to the work was a close to get a closed about the country.
It was so she was so if there was a big golf air.
And so my closer golf than the country to her across her appear.
She felt the ground, the foot of her feet, and then he knew that her at that moment but one thing to do to stonis: Why for her life.
She was running to home, backward by the close and then they had to see paper and paper see paper and paper.
When it was closed by her hold her ha was that her only chance her only chance it to write it on the only opportunity to write it on the only chance it to write it was her ha hold shed.
Sometimes she didn't have enough.
Then soe and rining them, but reach, it doesn't reach the house.
And in this moments the purpose of the past of her him, and then -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her wor
And I think there were even though -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were close to be close to be the close to be close to me.
And then she was looking for them to go to search and paper, and paper, it was close to her him through her him.
Juist at that moment she had a potately.
And with her other hand, so she told me me, so, they put it out of the air.
She was she's pulled it to his tail, and it back in her body while she was it back in her body while she was the way.
And in those cases came up to the close to the paper in the paper, but then in the paper, but then in the entirely follower.
When I think -- I thought -- what I was think, so that I think -- what I think about a creative process my creative process of creative proces!
This is what my creative process my creative process no! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, who every day every day on the same time on the same time.
But even in that daily swiming that daily had a experience.
You will also know it to know the knowledge, that there is a creative ideas in your opportunity of a source that you can identify.
What is that then fun for fun to bron?
How do we use it without that we get it without that we get it without the way without wealthy that we use it without that we use it without that we use it without that we use it without the way without of the calculat?
And in a way that we do that?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician's Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while I interview him for a while I interview him for a while I interviewed him for a few years ago.
We had this thing.
Tom is a big part of his life is the showed of his life is the showed of the section that is from all the power that from all power to get out of all the power creative impulse impulse impulse in him him in him him in him of him that redumes.
And the ''d be Tom some rustiger.
And one day he was a day he was in Los Angeles over the speed and changed the process of the process of the process of the radical.
And while he was so he heard a fragment, he heard a melodie.
The decide, as that is the inspiration that is faker death, ungrap, crop, crows.
It was a beautiful melose and he wanted to fash.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper touch, no table, no touch, no table.
The well-known excise of the head, "I rather the meloily of the meloily of the century of the century of me evenue.
I'm not good enough, I can't be good enough."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't stop the entire mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat it it it up the piece of the piece of the stuff.
"Do you really know that I can write a love of the writing of a song?
If you really want to do that this love comes later to later later when I have time for you have.
And not, somebody else -- somebody else --
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that point the process of the process of the process of the process of the process is very different.
The work itself, the work is the excise of the dark subject.
But the sware the creative process that creative process in him of him represented from the genion.
The geniy was to close to the house and livered the squate.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to the support on it.
It could be a wonderful single be, bizarre conversation between Tom and the odd aspect that not completely from Tom itself.
And that story my way of work work changed to work in the way of work.
I had a profishing from it.
I was in the middle in the middle of Ets, Biddle, Bids, Biddle.
And I put a point of a point in desp.
You know that you want to do not good to be good and you think it's a terrible ramp ramp of the book book.
Not summer bad and really really really terrible bad bad bad bad bad it.
I wanted to go all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project all of the project.
And then I remember Tom that are genius to his genion, and I decided to way.
I was going to me from my manuscrips and directly and directly to a fun to a fun to a very much of the room.
And I said hardopy said, "Luister ding, we know everything that if this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in the time.
I can't give me it.
If you think it's better can, you think it's to do better than you get to your thing to do to do you get to do it.
Snap you don't know that you don't know you can't do that.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notulles are away that are just amazing that is just a differently.
Tja--- Uitely it comes up here on this notice here
Every wen ago, there was going to be in the North African desert people together to sace in the maanswer music.
And the Urings, to the morning glors.
That was always amazing because the dans were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it was something for support to be something for support
One of those dance than transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know about that, you ever ever see, you have ever seen something that was seeing with a performer.
It was as if the time was saying and the dance of the poor.
He didn't do anything else than the thousands night, but now all of the sames.
And he didn't have a longer only a human beings just a human beings a human being.
In him under him of him him him him is glass.
A godnment him.
If you think of something that happened to kill people who was Dan they started to clap them and clapping up and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Go
Because that was the for them.
And by the way, a fun historic fact, the Moren Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu -- they brought this one.
The extinction is echter by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah," own."
And that you know, you have the day today to the day's flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If a artists in Spanish something unpossible, or magically, it rops, "Allah, oh, oh, oh, Every Gre, Allah, great, Allah, big."
Our understanding of God disease of God
Precions what we need need.
Lastig is the dance is the dance of the next morning to the morning in dinsdapy to 11 hours in the morning 11 hours don't have godable laddal laddyer.
And in that moment he is a what old is a little elder, with a bad of the well-such that will never come up to such a little bit of the well.
Maybe there will never be somebody God will never be somebody in dancing.
What do he now do is to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to selling for a creative gested to a creative mind.
But so it doesn't have to be to be to be to be there.
Now, imagine that you don't know about the most unusues of your person of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your person of your person
And imagine that you believe you believe them a while you have a while not a little bit of a source fun to be able bron.
When you ready it, they are given to somebody else on somebody else.
And so it is all the way of the so.
I hands that dad in the middle that dad in the middle of the dad
The last months I worked on a book, that will be differently. The book where a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of requires that is choice.
The operating improvement.
And if my mind with me to the hall, I love me of the same before I don't know the same before -- don't know the same before it.
Do just you work.
For just you do thing, what it's also is it is.
If you do it too dancing, thank you.
If the godable geniia that you is provided decided to be able to make a little time to make something from the wonderful sources, "Oly!"
And the thing that doesn't go thank you even though then, then,
And thank you say, "Olation!"
I believe that I believe that I believe
"Olen!" "How do you can see from pure human love and propertiliod, and propertished.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olate on!
You know, I had this projects about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what it means, and the discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology of the digital issues, and now we try to go from that digital code in biology and the design of the biology and synthetism and synthetism of life.
So we always have tried to ask the big question.
"What is something that I think is something that I think about the phones have tried to understand the levels of the levels of the level.
We tried to have different approach, it back to left back to lead left back to minimals.
We're almost 20 years of the digitize of the digities.
When we have the human genome of the human genome of the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask to ask life to life regenerate regeneration, or we can create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with a kind of that can aid itself in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a kind of such that can ama,
And we tried to look at if we have been trying to look at a little little tine.
We can take in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or so,
But if we look at the metaboolic ma, that's relatively relatively away with the unze.
Geless me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at a point that this is very unlikely that this is a living cell cell cell the cell cell cell that this is a living cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell cell to all the genes that was a living cell cell cell cell
We decided that the only route provide to be able to synthetise this chromosome, so we could be the components to be the components to be a few fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to imagine.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started to asking a chromosh synthetiseren?"
Sat the chemistry it to make this very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we do that, you can get a chromosome?
A chromospher, but a chemically, but a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is destraight on exponential evidence.
Our ability to write the genetic code lose of a slose slow-slowed slowed slowed slowed slowed slowing
And our last point that would take it on this point on an exponential curve.
And we're more than 15 years ago.
There were some city, some city, begin to start with a bio-ethic ethic ethic action,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a very hard.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making 30 to 50 letters in length, so how longer you make it a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the old thing that are the choices are the little piece of the things are touches are the little piece of the power of thousand
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces and corrigate from all the folds.
And this was our first pogation, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small sall of square dead.
We designed the pieces the pieces, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the things that we put a little piece of chemical chemical strain the bacteria and the bacteria genetic cogs and virtual particles and virtual particles and virtually make virtual particles and virtually make making virtually made a --
The viral particles were going to be the cells, they came back and deaths from the E. coli.
I was unlanguage in speak with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but all of the way to well.
They laughing more than you lo.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software are building to build its own heard, in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something a lot of greater to a lot of greater something a lot of greatters.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttles in cassettles so we could various the cassettta --
to understand what the deeth, what the deeths are of a living cell cell cell
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very accurap.
When we first first first of this genome together, the standard of the standard exactly one front of a 10,000 based.
And eventually we found after resequencing 30 mists. If we had the original sequence, it was not in the war in the war in the war
And the design of the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to be about, with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build seen set that we have to build together to build together to build together so that they can go together together.
We design in the fact of the parts in the parts in the spots of the subjects in the parts of the parts of the parts in the world.
Maybe you have a lot of you have watermers.
Bedity: we have a four-literally called A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C,
Trios of those litters code for the regular away -- that there is a literal attraction for every aminoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to writing words to write words,
And the antify we just get to me.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no closing animals.
We have these pieces are so designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repair and put together together.
And we started to make pieces of these five to these five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters were pas you have a lot of 24,000 letter, and you have a lot of 240,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every city of city we were a sure of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process that is very robuust -- that will be very robuying you see straks very robuy -- that will see strakill.
We try to do it from automatiseration to reach.
So this is what this is from this basketbalfine.
And so soon as we come to come to the really big pieces -- 100,000 based, they don't grow so easily more in E. coli.
And that explained the modern of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to get to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-o-od-response of the biology to reparers, that pieces together by the biology to reparers, that pieces together.
Here's an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans radiodurans that three million radiation of can.
And you see that you in the bottom of the chromosome of the soom is just from each other.
12 ots of 24 hours later it was going to go into each other, exactly as it was first time --
There are thousands of organizing organisms that around.
These organisms can be follower.
They can live.
I know absolutely sure that there is life in space that can predict to be able to find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of the is there there is a lot of it.
And here is a determine microph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact, with the right designer with the right designer where we did them.
And it is that they put it cartomatically together.
This is no electron-microscope microscope microscope photo.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience, we went out out to explain unlanguage.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by humans, with a duce structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point literally gave it is 10-point literally needed page of the genetic code of the genetic code
How do we started, how do we started, how do we started to it? How do we started it? How do we started it?
With a square is the clearly squatching is a single of easy.
And a bacteria is the much more complicated.
It's also simpleer if you give you eukaryots, like eukaryots, like wis: you know the celkern and do a different in and do is what you know if it's reading you as it to be the clone.
And in the bacteria species of the chromosome, but we have unlanguage in the cell, but we have a full transplantation of a chromosplantation of a chromosplantation of a cell transply.
We have a chromospher. We have a micromospher.
These are about so far from each other and mics.
We feed what extra genes to take this chromosome, so we could select for this chromosome.
We have it to make all the editions to make all the easy.
It was pretty sensational when we stopped this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced images here -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to set it to so. But we were trying to develop the process what happens to develop the process what to do is to develop the process what to do is to shape.
This is a essential evolutional evolution,
We discoveries all kinds of species that have a second chromospheres that have been remaking third in one third of throw in one time in one time in one degree for the species.
People that evolution is to be evolved one and it doesn't have a lot of biology --
There are enzyms that restrictive enzyms that are really enough DNA restrictimes.
The chromospher, it was not there.
The cell -- the chromospher, we stopped -- which is what it was --
It was expression, and the other chromosphering the other chromosome, and then we had the cell of the cell of the new chromosome, and we had the cell with the new chromospher.
He was blue from the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had strained in it.
And in very short time of the characteristics of the ene species, and changed in the new species, and it completely in the new software that we stopped in the new software that we stopped in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the new software in the celerate of the new software in the new software that we stopped in the new software of the new software that we straight of the new software that we
All the galaxies, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was the genetic code in the way.
This is a genomics like genomic, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental to change things fundament.
And I pay before, I payer paying that this is not a shoot -- this is preborduring in 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I payed a new species of the Cambrary of the Cambrbrary of the Cambranched new species, where there are making new species of the Cambrand, aseveral new species of the Cambrand,
Why would you do it?
And I think it's pretty clearly clearly when you look at what is need.
We're going to invitial ses-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
for each of us that in 1946; within 1940s, in 1940 years that there are four that there are four that there are four that there are four that there are four that will be four that will be four that there will be four that will be four that there are four that there will be four that there are four that there will be four that there are four.
We have to food, with food, with the head, water, medicine, medicine, fuel for the ses-a-half billion.
And that's really really really really to do that for for for that.
We use five billion ton college of collapsed five billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of vates, a day.
When we and, when we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than to replace; then that's a huge challenge of day.
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the state that in the atmosphere.
And in all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and that would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a doare different components, and look at the diversity that is from there is present from there.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thanks these, they have a lot of the sudden called combination genomics to do the combination genomics to do it.
We now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosome.
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes of genes and try try to produce octon to create or medicine, new vaccines to produce or medicine, we can change with a small team of team -- we can change in the last 20 years, then in the last 20 years, then in the last 20 years,
And it's just standard selection.
We can selecter for living vatbalthy, chemical or fuel of fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen image of what real design, and this is what we work to work, so you can really go to work and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer can design design and a new kind of the computer can design and design a new kind of the computer of the computer of what we can design and design a new kind of the computer of the computer of the real design.
We don't know what it will see is from the there.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We focus on our fighting generation brandsts.
Our slides you see founds, just just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come from the soperate that will come from coming from sugare, to be more and more and more and third and third of butano.
But the only way we think that biology big influence can have a lot of food neighborhood and the describes is the describes is as we begin with CO2 as his food, and so we are food, and so we think that the first of the first time in that we think the first shapes the first generation of the first generation of 18 months and have to have to have the first generation and have about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but we have all kinds of other methods.
This is a organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, at cokend.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water water water water water water water water water water as energy brone.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 and take a little easily to fable, which is a pipes that CO2 is coming back to fabry, where that CO2 to fuel to get this process to shake this process to stop this process to stop this process to sturk.
So in a short time we think we are thinking that we are able to take out of the basal question, "What is living to the basal question, "What is life?"
We have worky, you know -- the deaths are the petrochemical industry.
Yeah, you can't do this at TED where you can do any?
A important energy source is a very important energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the tools of these workle to think about speed vaccines of vaccines of vaccines in the crazy vaccines of these works.
This year was the gric, we always get a little back, just a little bit of the facts on the right vaccine,
I think that that can change from teaching the shaped vaccines of the shape.
And here you see how the future can see the evolution, the evolution, the evolution, the relationship of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukary, archeukaryota.
We are still farmers from the farmers of people.
Our goal is certainly to sure we make a chance enough to do that which is a chance to do that which is a chance to do that which is a chance what to do is a chance
What I want to show you if you want to see is the fundament of a new technology that we have to get to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in you can work in you get a lot of the distance of immense data can work with immense data can work
We look at the way, we look at the digital images and can stay here nature in -- and you can keep up and excent the and the sorters and the sorttering and the sorttering and the sorttery and the sorterms of the way.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how big information, how big images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan from the Library or Congress, and sit in the 300 megapixel of the 300 meapixel of the Lix.
It all doesn't matter because it all of the only thing that would be influence to a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen on the screen on the screen in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a full book, a very example of not-image data.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Every cold cold to a headd.
And to prove that it is really text is to do something that is really a imagination, we can do something that this really is a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a strange of a book in a book of a book of a book in a book of a book a power.
I wouldn't just it.
This is a realistic. This is an example. This is a example.
Every big image image is the beginning of a subject.
This is really the place you really see the place and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something that with the corner of the Guardian from The Guardian
We have a nep adververtic advertion -- a lot of higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra information of information --
If you want to see the power of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make it the limb of hands that we can do the screen from hands to do the screen to do the screen
We hope that this doesn't have a populate more means and other third -- not need to be more than that.
Of course, a nice of the agrants a for the sense of a technology as the one, I will not spend here to spend up here to this field is a lot of a lot of except that we can be a lot of a lot of behaviolence.
These are all the weain the U.S.
And then put on top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who two techniques two techniques together ther ther with.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very little piece of computer vision research of Washington the University of Washington Washington State Steve Seitz on University on U.With,
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible by Seadragon.
When we do this does, you see you that we see the images and the multi-resolution experiences.
The space of the images.
The computer vision vision of the images, so that they are built together so that they considered the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are. You see elements of the stabilized diashowhether of the images, and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is another environments to show you.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynthese, that we have this summer working on the environments -- to the communicate of this such is the power of the environments of the environments on our website.
We had to keep the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with image from Flickr. You just search Notre Dame on Flickr, and you get images of people in the on-shircles and the campus and the campus and equation.
And each of these orange chirs gives a image that model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model --
And so these are all all Flickr images, which are in this way of space in this way of space in this way of space in this way of space in this way of the things that are all the time.
And we can tunately touch,
You know, I had never thought I had never thought I ever thought I would have ever been working at Microsoft --
It's the animal of this is so unfortune here
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are types of gsm to muscle copy to the spire of them together, society in this environment.
I will try to find some strange what strange images.
There are so many of them are so much of faces and thir.
Erine between this is even a series of pictures -- there are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is chured by the program.
If we care in front in a physical picture, in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, the data from the data of everybody -- from the whole collective sease -- and the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth -- and copy -- and copy -- and copy -- and copy that everything about each other.
All these pictures are considered together, and shapes a very little bit more than the single of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth, that from the whole Earth.
And as a consequences this as a Stephen Lawler the Virtual A.
And this is something that grow in complexity when they use it in complexity of the predicts growing people who are used to the people who use it.
Their own pictures are presides of metape data that somebody else invote.
If somebody would want to clip and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Dame red, I can use it to all the data, and I can use it as a access to the space, that metape that metape that metape of the photos, and created a kind of cruise and crease creating the kind of cruise and business and business --
And of course, it's a be-product of this immens of this is a virtually virtually place from the Interte place on Earth, who is not only from airair, which is satelite images and other applications is dedictions and other apply is -- but also from the collective imagine of the collective photos, but also from the collections of the collective photos, but also is the sately-engined photos, and the other thing that is is engineering from the entions of the engineering photographotos,
And the tunately, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what you can copy that what you can copy -- in the next years, all images that are deed by everyone in the world that are deed by everyone on the world can copy together in the world together in the world in the world together in the world together in the world together in the world together in the next years, and I can copy together in the next years, and I do that what you can copping is Andersone, in the next years, and I do you can cople the the images that what do is is is is is is is is is is Andersondone of the imaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimaimages that what you get that what
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It create, to your wish wens, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that basis of the data in the imaginations.
And that's the exciting thing that is exciting when you think about the rich of semantic information that much of these imagines imaginations.
When you go to the web search for images, you feel a search and the text on the webpage page of information about what the image is a lot of information about what the image is going to take a lot of information about what the image is --
What if you copy that image is to all your imagination image?
Then there are the number of support semantic and the amount of the past that comes from there, it's a classical network-ake network-aging networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicited

I want to talk about some question of you ask about some question I think about a book in a book.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other fun from other fun
And I also try to explain some of what I was going to explain you which has been a mist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be precise to be precised together, the official dogm of all the axy, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is affect to get it the well-to-foot music from our citizens, to get to the highest level, we need to give them so much possible individual freedom of them.
Freedom is a big good ded, a great essentially part of the human part of the human being.
And the ventually apply is to treat the own insches to own insch, to reach a higher which is a higher which is no inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices that people have more freedo.
And more freedom means automatically more well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be able to deep ath,
And in our lives is this dogma step four.
I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle group.
Even about thress of threat.
No that 175 siz-clare threats are the hundressing of a deal markets different extra-virtual pholes and two, a lot of bas amicos have a balthy attention.
And then you can make tallow to make your task in the case, for the case, for the far, for the sense of you nothing to sit in sk.
So that's the supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can be your stroyes, you can stop your stroyer and cassetttesp, cassettttesp, radio destron.
And in that one electronicawinkle you can choose from this attention.
You can make sit sessential systems, with parts from the parts of winkel.
Like -- you have a lot of choice, you have a lot of choice.
And the other example -- communication.
When I was young ago away ago, you could all all kinds of the phone anone of Ma Bell.
You hours it it doesn't take it out. You cod it doesn't take it out.
And that was the present of the predictleft that it never study it.
And that time is the time is predicted time is predicted time is the time.
And the way there are very much different across the different appropriate of different across it.
And in mobile of cell phones is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- that with the nusher and cracy crack-fun fun late and crack-fun fun of the fun --
Wellip this model you don't see this model in the winke, but you can see that that involved in the winke.
The sequence, people come to the winke, and stop these question.
And you know how to ask the question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a possible to buy that doesn't do a lot of do.
And in aspects of life that life that are more important than the attention of muscle, is this explosive choices is a fact.
Gealth care -- it's in the United States, inavers not even more that you have to go to the doctors that you have to do what you need to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and you know, "We can do A, or we can do do But, or we can do Bay Brazy.
As a provide and took this animals.
But, and after then, and after it. What do you want to do do you do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is find find find find out what is find find find find it?"
And the doctor, "Again, "Again, and But, and But, and naddless.
What do you want to do do you do that?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you do me, what would you do you do me, what would you do you do --
And the doctor, "But I'm not you say."
And we call "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the sware of decision of decision of somebody with a considered of business -- the doctor, somebody who is free -- the patient, somebody who is frequired to take away to take a condition of the condition, and the patients of the line -- the patient of the concondition.
And the way of course, that is that nerature because the purch, you can buy and I don't buy them can buy them up.
Why do do if we can't copy them to copy them to copy them
Because they think we think we think we think we are the next morning, to ask that other market to ask that other market in the other market that other market in the other market that other market that other market our doctor.
Our identity -- unidenty, yet a foot of us is now absolutely on this dia choices, like you can see on this dia.
Our identity is that allows from our background.
We find ourselves -- so often from -- so often we want to get it.
Evere morning to the surface to the surface of the person you think what person you want to be able to be thinking.
Let's talk about the house, the shape, the shape.
There's a time was a time that freedom everybody else there is that you could be able able to kids that you could be able to kids began to kids began to kids.
The only realized was with whole, not when and what you did.
Now freedom everything for it.
I mean, I lessing students, that I was at at least students, which I was going to get lesson than house than house than house and then earlier.
They are not dommer or living in early early than in early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Don't I wouldn't it? Don't I trust not?
Or do I wait? No? Not first child or a career?"
These are all the question.
They are going to have to be an answer to them as this means they don't get their houwork and there was no good covering and there is no good cif.
And they have the same live. It's important life.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just to work in the technology that technology to work every minute every minute of every day's day's -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love a place that I love a place where WiFi it does.
I don't know that because I don't want to keep the place for mist.
But anyway, that huge choices of work in that we are still going to ask us to ask us to ask us and we'll work or not.
We can look at a footbalaxy of our sone, with us to look at the one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and the shape.
And even if they all of the things that are we all the time from that we all of those weath, "Sell I ask this phones that phones you answer?
As I just like this issue response? Selt this fuel writing this fuel --
And even if the answer is the answer we experience the footbalaxy of our son on a very different way.
And what we also look at at the great, the small, materialistic things life: life is a chair of choose of choose and choose of choose and shape.
And so the world was the world there was used to be the world
There were some choices, but not everything was a choices,
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad it?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad is bad on is a bad on is a bad of it.
And that huge choices has two effects of the human beings on the human human beings.
A very opportunity effect is the first thing that is the first other than confreedom.
And so many choices people find it to make it a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of the example of the investment of investments in free-planns.
A college of me dedicated access to investing data from Vanguard, a big policy provided society with about one million employment with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vestings.
They discovered that for every tens of any deaths that the work-aid work-aid two percent solided.
As fifth of foundares deeply deads with five than five than five than five -- Why?
Because it to fifth is so much so difficult to choose that people are just explaining to the choices to the next day, and so on.
And from extincluding comes out of the
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionate at their pensionation because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they have the choice knowledge that they have been so distray as a little bit of the choices.
And they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year to 15,000 dollars a year on their neus to go to the nose.
The work-working was a couple to reach their own behavior.
So a lot of choices can be lost work.
And I think the world that the world is that the world from that disease.
If it is the century, if it is you want to go very foundation, right?
You don't want to be operate with the wrong found, or even the wrong three, or even the wrong three.
And that's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dish and choose shapes and choose the result of the result than it would be less less and educations.
And there are measurements for to feet.
One of there, for example, for example, for example, from tasy to engage the choice,
You can be in a case for that another choice for that another choice would be astone.
This is droom alternative carry-native you get to the choice.
And then it does dead the foot of the choice of the choice that you have made you have, even if it was a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options, des there are deaths to have it to have the spike of unit that election of the gecoins.
A second reason of doing substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning, all of the things that we allow the value of things that we get them to equire them to be equire.
If you can intend to intend to intend to think of the alternatives that you can see the alternatives that you described that you move.
And that makes you fewer tacks the alternative that you have coad.
A example. New Yorkers under New Yorkers under you. My excuses.
This is a little bit the streetch.
This is on the vasistance in the Hamptons.

And he sit there two weeks to the idea that he was a great parking place a great parking place a great parking place place a great parking place place for a great parking place place for a great parking place for a great parking place for a great parking place that he was a great parking place for a great parking place for two weeks,
And the subject cost of the entire we have to have from our choice, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possibilities, des are the more possible alternative.
And those presents of us as substitutional costs.
One of example.
This imagination is the imagination of points.
Life in the and now for example, and you don't have to consider the things that you don't have to go away to aday.
And another point is that you have to get with every choices of choices.
And all of the other thing that are amazing option, which is the gecoases option is lessing up the geodd.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this in my search a new benenhouse to a new bonend.
I turn almost always spoke up there.
Fger there was only one kind of a kind of speech, and you thank you. The pages, it doesn't believe, it was uncomfortable, but if you don't have the book long, and often enough and often enough and often enough it -- and often enough it OK.
And I went to the winkel for a new for a new again.
I said, "Day, I want to get a speech, this is my made a me."
And the winkely said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed a relaxed pit?
Do you or a crits? Wilt you or a crow? Wilt or acid-washed or acid?
Do you can get a bouch effect?
Wilt you something explaining pike up and flink out of pipe." And so he went out there.
I was a little bit of it. No a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to get the only one."
And he had no idea which was not a idea which was that was a hour, all the possible bbs of the engineering birds of the works.
And I think is quite quite a -- I remember the winket end with a challenge of a benhouse bout.
I had the better day. Then all of the possibilities, I could do it better do better than it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself out of myself from my himself in a book.
The reason I don't feel better with all of the choice, I was more to expect of the state of a good speech, from a good speech,
I started without any only expected without any kind of expect of a kind of expectancle.
When there was different wars, and one of them would be a lot of the distine.
And what I cod was good, but not perfect.
And so I reach my bound, I remember, and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities, people have deaths to deaths that they knew about the past of that possibilities.
And that means people are less testing with results of the results are even when the good results are even when the good results.
Marketinging people don't know this is not knowledge.
Because in that case, you don't know what I know about it.
In the real thing is about so on.
Everything was a better when everything was bad was bad was a bad better.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a little bit of the experiences.
In our modern society, we can be as a various citizens, but the best thing we can ever reach, but the best thing we can ever reach, is that something as well as we had to reach.
None of we are rather distinction, because our expectanctions,
The secret of happiness -- this is for this is -- the secret is not to be a lot of happiness is not too much more expectations.
I want to do -- a little bit -- a car biographic, that I am a woman who is really fantastic amazing that is really fantastic is a woman is a great great great --
I didn't have a less tacked with less tacked me with less tacked me with less tacked me with less tacked me with less tacks.
But with less enough nearly takes are good cants.
And so so that we slot: When you are a bad set up a bad set as there is one kind of predict is one kind of predict why you can ask why you impeace.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible to you have no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different boundarable, and you can cooke, and you can cooky, who's is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just just so simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different bonenters. You don't have a excuse to fale.
So if people decided to take up the results of that decided to be good good for the results of that decided about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society is clinic depression under the young generations of the guy generations of higher generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy generations of the guy
A factor -- not the one one of the engineering factor, in this explosive toenge of depression and self-mod, is that people often have been so often in the experiences are of their high expectation of their high expectation of their high explosion.
And if they then try to explain the teleurpose to explain themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettors is that we put objective objective objective on predictive to fellow up and feel the bad of it.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to get for everybody else to get for everybody is going to be able to get for everybody to get for anyone for everybody is going to get to it.
But that's not the thing is not.
The list doesn't can choose better than you can choose better than not choose better than you can't choose it even automatically that more choicically.
There's a magic ground. Wale, I don't know it.
But I know that we already for the point that choices are what is is that choices us what is improved.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries is predicted from material overline of material overlabor.
There are a lot of places on the world, there we heard before, where the problem is not so much choice, but it's the choice, but right now, it's a little choice.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that moderne, which is the modern West.
That's frustrers, and it's such about this, and I think about this is told you to told that extend to installing children don't help children don't help kids. Suns don't help help.
I say you the same about this sure, including choices -- they don't help not, they help up to the shado.
They are living less word.
If a part of what people in our society to make all those choices to make all those choices that people have to do all of the people who have to do anywhere people are living people on the previous opportunity;

Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A scale imagination, a shortily worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this fis the smart.
Because in fact, there is the hand: If you have the fish of the sense of the power to create possibilities, you don't have a freedo, but lost lower to create the freedo.
If you get the fish sentence to create opportunities, you get less touch, you get less touch.
It leads to more diverse and less and less testrange.
Everybody has a vision sense of the sense of the sense of it.
This is free sure -- even even for the fise, but certainly for us.
But the desire of a figure out of a figuring out of a figure out of the things to say to missing about it.
Thank you for your attention.
