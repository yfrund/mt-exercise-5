And for a few years, I showed these two dia's pool, to show that the pool, who had about three million years about the last three million years about the present of the United Statand 40 percent kroms.
But this is actually the support of this specific problebecause it doesn't have the didness.
The ice skin on the North Pole, in a certain in the seck heart of our global climate system.
It set out in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a version of what is happening version of what the last 25 years.
And the permanent ice is a dish in red.
Like you see, it out of dark out of dark in the dark of darker.
That's the jury ice ice ice ice ice of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
And the so-called permanent, five years or older, or almost like flowing blood is almost like flowing it up in the body.
And in 25 years is the one of this to this one.
And that's a problem because the freezing around the Northern Ictual Ictic warmer and there are a very big amount of woman is frozen frotty of woman is becoming a microbes in methane.
And the deal with the total amount of the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, that would be required that could be required the amount of the atmosphere.
In some indeepe deepe in Alaska hidden methane in the water.
And last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another ondie.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is the question or we will be able to be able to be there.
A reason for that, this is that this huge called Groenland from the north of warming from the north of warming warms.
This is a melectwater river of them.
The water-volume is echer than ooking it greater than oom.
This is the Kangerlussuain river in South Greenland.
And if you want to know how the sea set because it is the agricultural bes in the sea place where it is the sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea of sea sea sea of sea
This stroming takes flu.
On the other hand, on the planet on the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And last months rapported scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice ice calance itors of the entire continent to the entire continent to the entire continent to the entire continent to the entire continent now,
More specifically the ice of the South Powest of the South Pell of the South Peltineilanother.
The whole continent is for six meter sea-meter seespieces of the Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after massas, there are new now, there are new now, which were still a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the half of his drinking water of the smell time.
In the Andes, this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stroys.
But when they disappearing the drinking, it also drinking water.
In California was a further of 40 percent in the snow,
It comes in the water reservoious reservoiles.
And as you could read the predictable to be loved in the way to be lot.
This global dream of trial trial has a dramatic stiping from bosands.
And the number of course, about the world is spent with an incredible and never seen a ingular and never seen set and never seen a sense of the number of course,
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years, in the forest 75 years.
This pattern is completely unfortunately.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 across CO2 every 24 hour.
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the eye area of the Stile of the Stilled, from America, westing from America, and every south, there is a behavior, there is a behavior in the oceans.
The only big causes of the earth, the rest of the earth, which is the regular to 20 percent of pursuit for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and steenching is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding in China.
And there was a lot of support carbon centrales in building a lot more support of stengages.
But we see a couple of them.
These are the supported centrales where the ban was annumber in the last last years, and where green alternatives were annumber alternatives were present alternatives were ansolid of the bomen's carbon the last last years.
There's a political straight to the gang in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industiry gave 250 million dollars from to promotion, 250 million dollars out of the beautiful for a concept of the conversation.
And that image did something thinking about something thinking about something like this.
And then the church of the home in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally belied.
You probably seen it in the news of news in the news of news
This is the one after largest falling fall.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the cities of steenkoolege of the Kerster was the Kerster was the Kerstiod.
Video: ""Frosty the steenk-carbon-carbon-bond-care.
He is fluence here in America, and he cars here in America, and he cars for that our economy.
Frosty the support carboner with the day beauty.
He was paid and shattches and worknets and works."
Here is a big part of the city-coal in West Virginia fromber-day.
The largest most worker of the country is the great bones of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear to be clear and the Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know what they have it about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate,
This is a piece of a little bit of it.
Video "Be COLwory, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our business.
That's why the reason why the most important goal is to give us a gigantic behavior to response to the light and bring the light of the truth of the truth of the truth of value carb.
Feit is, step is not smart.
We find that it is sowed -- and it still liked, and it still liked.
So, you don't make a carries about climate change.
Let me just talk about our over.
Video: Acteur: Schone steenks, you heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shone calling carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of lawycheat.
But that's the sound of a clean steenk-carbon technology.
And then, the fact that the fact that the branchose of the most important warming warming warming the extractly solid of the Earth is shake of the summers that you see all here.
Look at the beauty, this is the shakools of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative security of national security.
Video: Stem: America sales in crisis, the economy, the national security security, the climate crisis.
The rocked in all of these things, our dependence of fossil fuels, like vile coals, like villions and imported the dioily and imported oily of the oily of the phost of the phoile of the pursuch of the phossil of all of these things,
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
For America is 100 percent shealthy shealthy solid years.
A plan to get America to get America work on the work and then a plan that makes us safe and the operator and the operating the Earth is a regular across the Earth
And in the enough one solution that enough is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. It's about it.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about America to give America to give America
One of the fastest ways to make a end of our dependence of old fuel of old fuel of old fuel that our planet to help our planet to help see.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, health, a new energy system.
And then you get 2: Noose investments to create good paid jobs to create good paid jobs to create good paid to create good paid for good paid to create good paid for good paid good paid to create good paid good paid to create good paid to create good paid job
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African old African ance talks that says, "If you want to be everyone to be everyone to be everyone.
If you want to go far far."
We need to go far far, and fast.
Thank you very much.
And I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I refed to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am now, I think that there are not waren't waren't waren't the largest scientific experiment ever entremendous experiment ever in enomb.
It has to be the conditions that were dealing the considered less than a billion, after the universe after the universe started to 600 million times a second of a second of 600 million times a second of a second of the universe of a second of the universe.
Enorm ambitius, ds!
This is the machine under Genere:
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bang's inside detectors and this is the gene I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter. 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attacular imagine.
And on 10 september of september we put the machine for the first time to be the first time to be the first one.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that worked for a feestimate in the controlllling room.
It's a picture of the first particle straight of the first particles that all around the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, with a piece of the LHC, by a piece of the LHC, by the detector stricks.
In other words, when we saw this picture on 10 September that we knew that works, we knew that is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across the largest across and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet pages out of the Internet pages out of the Internet pages out of the Internet in the behind of the behind the Internet page of the most the Internet page of the most the Internet page of the Inter
That means we made a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact of impact as a scientific impact of a scientific impact.
And a week later we had a problem with the machine, what was doing with these golden dramals.
And they were a thousand of circle couple of crashed power works.
The engineers will say, "Not true true. It's not true.
They can do that because they can do superidend to be in very low-temperaturs.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can become a behairs that became away that strice.
In one of the connections between the neine of thousand magnets in the LHC, a constructive of the LHC,
And then the wirelectrical weather was intended to the intential resistance that 13 thousand campy-campers.
This was the result.
This is still insull this is a little bit of the magnets more than 20 tons than 20 ton away over 20 tons of the away to be placed about 30 centimeters.
We were about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of them.
We all were response.
And now they're back to way.
Eind set will be the LHC against intact.
We will go and we'll expect it and we expect measures in juni or right so we can go to figure out with the construction of the universe.
Now, of course, that have insounced the debate re-insounced research. It's easily to work. It's easily to work.
I think it's fact that it's so hard is, the fact that we go further than equipy is the true of things like the LHC.
I showing the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think, moved in the conditions of the values of his teachers, his teacher is -- his teacher his teaching for the progresing of the progress of human mind to the progresing human mind that we have to take our images of scientist that there are not a mysterious world's a new mysteries of the world's confolding to be no new mysterions are in the world.
Thank you very much.
I would like to start with you to ask you back to your children's while you played with blocks of blocks
When you discovered how to graduate them and then they were wrong and woot, you know, you actually problems with the teaching and high by the connection of space relations.
Ruimtely insight is destront of understanding the world to understand the world.
If an information inspired by the nice of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- and my measure Jeeding Calanithi -- what we would use a computer of the enduring of the engine, in the ene, in which kind of a kind of digital vingeration that can be able to confinger with the individual information with the individual information and we can fy with the information with the confitting of information with with with with with with the conconconstant information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information that we can can can conconconconconconconconconconconconconstant information with a sulation with a fount with with the neigh
and ordering ordering as we want?
This question was so far, that we decided to figure out an answer to figure out of Siftles.
Sort collaborate is a Siftable computer size a cooking.
They can be put with the hand they can feel together, they can feel detect and they were able to detect a shared and wireless and wireless and they can be a sact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be able to graduate the blocks can be packed by the graph of them to gray it.
And the vendies are Siftle's a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this is a more physical differentling a more physical differently, his movement and even of the way we move them from each other, there are different new and more of interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video to tell a video chances and others and otherset it is played to be changed operating a single changes.
This interactive portrait are consciousness.
Indians narrigor, they will will be interest in constitutions.
And if they can be ringing this and can also this and can be making it and what become more becoming a little bit of becoming a little bit of becoming a little bit of becoming a and can be.
And they feel movement and helling.
And we realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of these interaction, the use of all of these interactions, like it was a low-shooting of a color as it was a fluisto.
In this example of these example of Siftles and I can use them for and I can use them to go in a very good, where they are good.
And if we have float, we go, we go.
There are some of the education possibilities for education, especially playcles with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things to the result of people to see the result of the immediately remember of the immediately education.
And here I show -- this is the developing of a Fibonacci series by a simple response of a simple response of a Fibone-one set of the engineering of a Fibonacci series by a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci of a Fibonacci series of
Here we show a game is a cross-between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter gets in every Siftle, and then found out of the Siftle, and then further, in a wordbook.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescued, and a difference of a new series of series with a new series of opportunities with a particular series of a new series of a new series of a lot of letters with a very recently, it is a new series of them.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I got to make a video of a video of a video of it.
They were really away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people need.
And all of what you have to say is "Moy word" and what they need to do to do it exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people on the testing of the tests.
That's our botta tester, rights in the right.
But, it seems that he was wrong the Siftles.
And for him this was only blocks.
Here is a interactive paintingly,
We wanted to develop a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstry.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Sifttable with that carakters of the table.
Here he leave the sun outcomes.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done ans! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftles, and the need-behaving one one of the need-connected one -- Video: Wah the characters with each other: Wore the carakters with each other: Wore the nearly of the shapt!
DM: and so his own storytelling
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decided how it it up.
Video: The cat flies fly away
M: The last example that I will show you today is a synthesizer and live music that we have developed a synthesizer and pressure as the lead, which every Siftles and pressure pressure and pressure pressure and pressure prem.
Eengineer, in four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it to use a different variations.
This sounds can be in a lived in a lege Siftlege in the pattern itself in the patternns itself in a little bit of the patterns in the patterns in the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a living Siftable effects of a locontrollable effects like reversable effects like reverb and filter.
They are becoming a sound and advanced by changes.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are performance that are appropriate in the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Sifttles, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a very first pattern,
And now I put the basline of the basline
Video: Now I feel what I can do is a battacks.
Video: DM: And now I heading the filter of the print, so that I can influence.
Video: DM: I can get it to be very accell by the chances of the tempo blockice.
Video: DM: Now I headly head the movie for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rere-re-re-re-re-shopping the pattern.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise to planns, the very longer and shorter like I want to do it.
And in the end of the dimit of the dimms of the volume Siftable to opportunity.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from new people, I think of new peop-computer interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brain and bodies and bodies and bodies work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area with some of the abilities that we have developing in the lab.
The thoughtly, I want to bring about is that this is only the attacked to a very new generation of hell in the interacting with digital media, which we want to our world as we want to do it.
I thank you from hard.
I look at it out of you to talk to you to talk to you all the time.
I'm writing.
But, my work, but also the more than that.
My whole life for a long life I was writing from writing and I don't think that change.
And yet there is a little bit of the property in my life and career, and career, I had to see my relationship with my work again.
It started with a book, I had written a memoire: "Etttom, Biddinner -- Beminnen," which is a very contratradiction to my first work.
And the consequence is that people have to go and always touch as if I do do do do it.
And the thing -- the member.
People come to me and ask me and ask card: "Ben you don't have to evenar?
Do you don't afraid you will keep you will keep writing your entire life will be able to audience?
Don't you get to be able to do it?"
And then you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very be. But I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was a teenager, I was a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Do you don't afraid for education, that you will go through this one?
Do you don't afraid you will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get your high-bitter-bitter-bitter-bitter-a-bitter-a-a-bitter-being?"
Itin that streting.
And in the short is my answer to ask this questions on this is "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough of things that are enough of things.
All of the time you can get already
But I'm also a lot of other things are afraid of other things for everybody knows for everything.
For seawful for example, and other engineering things.
But what became writing for myself the last time that are angst of what it comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logically that someone eight is a bad for the work for the work for working for their mention on Earth are eas?
What is so particular to create processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the mind-mind-ashion the bottomy is not happen to anything else.
Take my father. He was shared engineer, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years that he worked on it in the 40 years, and I didn't have someone at him for it was not afraid to it.
And so of course, "Yohn, how is it with your chemistry?"
No, no, so there was not about it.
To be fair for being: sharing engineers have been hones by the centuries have not the reputation of a manical depressive coholists.
Scheat, who have a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, other creative people have been able to be the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of people have becoming the reputation of people have have been instable.
And look at the grim of the 20-do-le-de-do-le-magnife of the 20th century.
Many fell young, often by own across it.
And even the degenes who are no suicidentify to be under their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be suicipacked their gave ord to be a suicident.
In the last interview for his dead for his dead said, "Well, one of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mititself."
That's a little bit about your life work.
But of this kind of extensive we don't look at it.
We all heard it before, and have it heard it with all accepty.
The hemissing is that creativity is that creativity is unlosing with list and that a artist-existing eventually lead to celerate to across the across the across of the connection of the connection of the connection is that creativity will read to the
So I want to ask anyone here today I want to ask with that idea idea of life is living the idea of life?
Do you do that?
Because I think I think about it, I think about it now, I don't think it's a very good daught in daught in the way to be a pretty good daught for a little daught of it.
I like it is the weather too.
And also even dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century is so good.
We can create a lot better than a lot better attacks.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, for my situation, for that dark in the dark of the dark of the dark for that dark in my situation.
She looks at the bottomy is in my career.
Go now, I am still young, amper vehicle.
I can be a four decadecadecades to work in the way.
And suspect of the suspect of the out-world become by the outside, as the work that followed on that outside, as the work that outside,
And we are with friends under the another, so I can sell it is a little bit of the largest success of my griggest success.
Yemig, what a idea!
And if you think about it is to you know it for your own, and you know, in the morning of the morning of the determine of the deawful in the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning for your hours.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me with the work I love with the work I love the work I love a work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go with writing a psychological protection in the process of the process involve in the process of building.
I have to create the writing of a securate distance between myself and concerned between myself and my overamazing angles for the response to the response of my future audiences in my future audiences in the future of the writing of the response of the writing of the writing of the writing of the writing of the
I just just following the last year, to ways to do that.
I am in history and I have a doctor, and I have me in other civilizations to see or someone better way to help or someone better way to help people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been born to the old Greek and Romends.
And then you know, it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romend, people didn't believe, people didn't believed that creativity was from hentered themselves.
And they believed that creativity creativity was a god-affect place, unknown for the ments came to the mental reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasons.
The Greeks called this calls called this decisions of creativity "demonen."
And the one of Socrates believed that he had a demoon who had a demoon that he was influistered him in the wrong.
The Romend, the Romend,
By them was called creative creative creative medicative minds.
The funny is that the Romenin with a genius with a genius to be a pienced pienced to a particular person on on a particular person on with a genion.
In their policy was a kind of magical godd-magical god-entitit that were in the ately, in the ately,
A little bit like Dobs the household.
And if the artistate at the work was assistance.
And in fact, he gave it work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first one, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant working for you you all the eat.
Everybody knew that was an invisible geniion, you had hold.
And then you go and get you to get it out of you.
Everybody knew that you had a non-independent genion.
Lange time is that we had been available to creativity was available
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything changed
And there was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and the converse of the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical weather, and attacked from the godddddling of the godd-connected world.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual fortune of the individuals.
And for the first time in history was there about artists said that they were a genius and not that they were a geniion.
I should say that I think I have to say that a big follow-follow-followed me that I have to say that I think I should say that I think I have to say that a big front of it.
And to make one person, one one of individual individual is that he or the securcurrent is the source of the century of the century of all of the ecentury of everything else -- that's something about a lot of responsibility for a fragility for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun in satch a sketcheat.
Ego's become rebuilding up to gigantic proportions and there are improsable to prestently prestatient to prestent in prestative to prestents of the implications are requires.
And I think this pressure has been the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists has made a lot of artists.
And if that's that is, and I think, is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this different different thing?
Can we return back to a old understanding of relationship between the ments and creative mysterious mysterii?
Maybe not.
And we can make 500 years we can rationally rationally rationally rationally in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes
And the probably sit in the audience people who are reduced scientific displayches about the idea that elerating the idea that elphenomenon with what fact the work of artists to inspiring up to inspiring up to inspiring high-temporing high-like audience of the idea that elephind of the idea that elerating in the audience of the idea that elerator in the audience of the idea of the idea that are of the idea of the
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in that I will get you in there,
And yet I ask it out.
Why no?
Why would we have this thought isn't what we would have to do it to this?
It fasts just so much much of the other explanations of totally unclears in the creative uncalculity that are including in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, and so in fact here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational acequipy of it.
And it sometimes almost paranoral ate.
I have been the great American closer to the great American animal Ruth Stone is a
She's closer in the negentig. Her entire life already writing closing.
She told me about her youth in the platand of Virginia.
Sometimes if she was on the field, and it was a close to the work one, about the country.
It was told one, like there was a big golf air.
And so I said, "Well, a golfing than the country to her country to do it.
She felt that the ground, I started to sowed and knew that moment and knew that moment and do it in the time to do this: reneway.
And she ran home, eight-home, and they had to see it as quickly as possible and then paper and paper to paper and paper than it to packing.
And when it was closed by her hunt her hundreds of of waving it in the way to write it on the way it in the waves of the wavice.
Sometimes she was not soon enough.
Then soing and ran out, but reaching the house is not.
And in such a little bit of the closer by her him, and then dwide in the field, in her words -- in her words -- to another closer -- to another closer to another closer to another closer to a different close of the purposed of the purposed by the field,
And I think it was a little bit of -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost close to be close to be close to do it.
And then she was looking for a set and paper and paper and paper it through her hidden by her him.
Juking at that time she had a potately.
And with her other hand, so told me she's sent the closer to me from the air.
She paked it to his tail, and it back in her body, and it back in her body, while she wrote it again.
And in that cases came up with the closer to the closer in the paper in the paper of paper followed followed follow.
And then I thought I was thinking -- what it is a destate of the creative process of creative proces!
And this is what my creative process not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a muiled-one one day on the same time of the same time of the same time and transforms and transforming with blood, and transforming up with blood.
But even in that days I had a swine a experience.
You will also be able to know it itself that feeling creative ideas in your exciting up in your expensive ideas in your impossible to identify in your impossible to identify the way to identify in your exist.
What is that then for bron?
How can we use it without that we use it with?
And in a way that we do for our is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musiciance Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a magazzine.
We had this government.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life has been shown of the contemporary artists that are tried to get out of all the power of the impulse of the impulse of impulsable creative impulsable creative impulsable creative impults in it up.
And in the 190s was Tom what a little bit more restone-fally.
And one day he required in Los Angeles about the slowed process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the so.
And while he heard a fragmentation of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that does does deal is depply goes, ccrazy.
It was a beautiful melodied and he wanted to fashion the vasthor.
But it doesn't go to it.
He didn't have a paper touch, no touched a touched in the angle.
The well-exciting exciting back and then beyond the melothat cheat, and then stay the calls of the equipment and then stage to me equipy behind me evily behind the too
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't stop that all of the mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I behind the piece?"
"Do you really writing that I can write a song of the on?
If you really want this song that this love is what you have to get later later when I have time for your time for you.
And not, somebody else else are falling falls.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And then then then lose the process of the process of course,
And the work is the same thing with the dark of the dark of dark in the sub-to-of showed to.
But the summing exciting the creative process in him opive process in him that he distant distance distantial of geniiius to be distantial response.
The genion, it was going to close and read just the skin, and just just catch it and read just crazy and read just the skin.
And in realized that there was no reason to go to the subject by going.
It could be a wonder, bizarre conversation between Tom and the oil and the odd aspect that not completely from Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of works.
I have been a profit of a little profites of it.
I was in the middle of Eat, Biddom.
I go in a moment I tell you in well.
You know that what you want to do is not good to be good and you think it is a terrible ramp is a terrible ramp of it. The book ook it.
Not soily bad and really bad bad bad bad and bad bad it.
I wanted to do all project all of the project
And then I remember Tom who who who who who who was a little bit of the genion, and I also got a posed to way.
I knew me from my manuscrip, and I was founded me and directly to a very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know about all the way that if this is not just brilliant is, then it is not only by me.
You can see that I have all in what I have in the stop what I have in me.
And I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better than you have to do it better than you have to do things.
Snap you don't do that, you know, you don't thank you.
I just writing because that's one of my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are a magine of being a differentline in the cantor differently.
Tja--- Usongs it here in this --
Euwen ago, there were in the North African woostine people together to thank you in the North African ance in the heay music.
And the Urings and hours and hours of the morning light of the morning light.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes the very something, it happens to something for a little bit of the subject.
One of those dance became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you have ever seen that you have ever seen anything in a performer.
It was like the time was saying and the dance and the dance by a poor.
He didn't did nothing else than the thousands of night thousands of night and now, all the set together.
And it doesn't leave a lot of a human beings just a human beings a human being.
In him, under him bities him him.
A godnment hours of him.
And if something called the thing happened happened to people what it was started to clap them and clap them and crows, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because that was it for them.
By the way, a fun historic fac: When the Moren South South Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu with mee.
The outside, is echer by the century hundred of the century of "Olye, oil Allah."
And that hear you have the day still flaments and flaments and flaments and flamengovernments and flaments and flaments of flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flatings today.
If an artists in Spanish something impossible or magicall, it is ropt, "Allah, oh, oh, OK, oh, all the way, Allah, amazing or or magicallen."
And the understanding of God slip of God.
And the recipmentary what we need.
Lastig is the dance that the dance of the next morning morning to the next morning to the followed in a hours of the morning 11 hours in the morning of the morning is morning more of the morning of the morning is to be a goddd-morning to be a
And then then he is a little bit of a little man with lots of amazing with a bad more to such a little bit of the heads will come to such a little bit of the head.
Maybe there will never be somebody God never across someone else of these.
What does it now is to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell a creative mind to a creative mind.
But so it's not to be not to be to be to be not to be to be able to be not to be a very nearly nearly neet.
And if you don't know that you don't come out of the most unusual aspects of your person from your person from yourself.
And imagine that you believe them a while, you have a while, you have a while,
When you are ready with someone else they are giving to someone else.
And so, it is all the way to be everything.
I are invent inresources that are thought;
And the last months I have a book, I will go to a book that will different. The book. The book. The book. The book where a lot of requires a check of a book in a book in a book in the last months that is going to be a little bit of a lot of re
The follower of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the hall, I love the same before I still the same before I still save the same thing.
You just work.
And just you do thing about you do it, what it is.
And if you go to dance your job, thank you.
If the goddddddling that you is the god-time decided to make a little time in your work on a little bit of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the godnment.
And then not, thank you that thank you but it gotten alone.
And then then, "Olne!"
I believe that I believe that I believe
"Olet me how much much more because we can just get human love and property of human love and propertishing human love-force plues.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olon!
You know, I had this all about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome, and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
And we actually actually get a new point, we were the biology to the digital biology to the digital code to a new physal code to a new physics to go to a new physics, and synthetise of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's living a life?" is something that have tried to understand the understanding of different levels in different levels of the levels of biolos have tried to understand the different levels of biolos have tried to understand the different level.
We tried to get different approached to least it back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years, it's almost 20 years.
And then we have the human genome of the human genome, it was from from the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for question: can we create regenerate regeneral new life from this digital universe of this digital universe.
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome, in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a little bit of smaller genome.
We can go in the order of hundred genes, from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map, which is relative to the metaboolic with the unancient of the unancient of the unancient of the insides.
Gelor me, this is simply simply
But when we look at all the genes we can look at a piece of shape, it's very unliving cell that this would be a living cell of the cell of the genes that would be a very unlived cell that it would be a little bit of the genes that would be a little bit of the genes that would be a little bit of the genes that would be a very unliving cel
And we decided to do that the only route forward this chromosophim to synthetise so we could get the components to be able to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like this: "Can we started a chromosopm synthetis?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosophistic?
A chromosom, the way, but a piece of chemically-chemically.
So, our tempo of digitalizing digitize of the life is responential evidence of exponential evidence of digitize the digitize of the digitize of the digity-tempo of the digity-tempo of the digity-tempo of the digitize of the digital way of digitaliz
Our ability to write the genetic code of lose slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly across the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the gene
And our last point of the last point on this moment in a exponential curve.
And we're started to 15 years ago,
There were a number of stadia for a couple of stadia bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethic experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard there.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making pieces in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it pieces of the point of the purposed to be a little bit of the points of the pointints in the world that are little bit of the power of thousand
So we had to make a new method for the confoot of these little pieces and corrigerate of all the bottoms of all folts.
And this was our first poging, beginning with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death of the bacteria deate.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, did the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of it started to be a chemical stacross chemical stone in the bacteria and the bacteria called called the genetic code and virtual particles and virtual particles and virtually make a virale parts of the bacteria and virtually started to make a little bit of the bacteria of chemical code of the bac
The virale particles were telling out of the cells, they came back and then then then the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but all about good fasts.
They laught more than you law
So we think this is a situation that this situation is a software can build his own heardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much greater
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosom.
That's more than 580,000 letters called code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttles in cassetts in the cassettta tes of viruses,
to understand what the deadmine components of a living cell of a living cell of a living cell of a living cell of a living cell
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than needs to the computer that digital information in the computer that are very accureat the entire information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that should be accure.
When we first first did this genome together this genome of the despirit was the despirit of a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 ancient 30 ancient sequence of sequence than it was not in the original sequence than it was not in the way to start to start to get the original sequence.
And in the design of the design of pieces that are 50 letters who have to confidence with all the other pieces of 50 letters to do with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build together to build together to design so that they can go together to design so that they can go together to make together to be together to do it.
We design in a design unique parts in a little bit of a lot of unique parts in a design of a design incentives.
Maybe you have a little bit of watermarks in strongs.
Bediti: we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G.
Trios of those letters code for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a literal attack-inoxygen for every aminoxygen of oxyoxygen
So we can use the genetic code for words, and swriting words, thought.
And antily we just just asked me to do just a lot of it.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no closer animals.
We have these pieces of pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms they repairs and they were repairs and each other.
And we started to make pieces of pieces of pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were going to be able to 7,000 letters in each one and you have to get from 24,000 letter, to 724,000 letter, to 72.000.
In every stadium knew a government of these pieces so we could could, because we could create them to create a process of a process of a process -- that will you be a little bit of a process of now.
We try to reach the point of automatically.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they grow up so much more easily more in E.
And that explains the most of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to remechanisms.
We know a mechanism that we know that homolo-combination response of the biology to repairs, that is used by the biology to repairs, that pieces of the crosses.
Here's an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinocococcus radiodurance radiodurance of straling on can.
And that you see in the forest, and it just soom crazy out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later later it again, exactly like it was first time it was first of the first one,
There are thousands of organisms that around.
These organisms can be completely sun.
They can live in a vacuum lives.
I know absolutely that there can be life in space, that can produce that can be moving to move forward to find out a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of it, there's a lot of of it,
Here's a very deeply microfo-molecule that we made with this processes -- fact with these processes -- facital with the right mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we did them in the right thing we did them in the death.
And it is that they have automatically foot cartomatically contemporary.
This is not a electron-microscope photograph. This is a microscope.
It's such a molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience we spent insludes.
This is more than 580,000 letters at genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecuulgeso-weight million.
If we would take it with a 10-points letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages just to press the genetic code the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 10-pointing points with a 10-point of points with a 10-points with a 10-points
Good, how do we started a chromosop? How do we have it it?
And it's clear a virus is the clearly easy of easy.
And it's a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eat eukaryots, like eukaryots, you just the cell and do a different in and do another in, and that's what you know if it right.
And in the bacteria species of chromosquito's chromosquited in the cell, but we have a complete transplline that we can actually have a chromosomic mosom, and it can extend to another another, and it can be a a thromosh to another another, and we can do it in a different and activation.
We have a chromosophic sexified of a micromosh appropriate.
These are about that are far far as people and micians.
We were extra little bit of extra for chromosophic mosomic mosom.
We have the response with enzyms to make all the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be a very avanced with this -- and you will be able to be able to be able to be able to the cell in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell images here in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell images of the cell
We even thought he would come to solid it to set it out of the process of developing process what happens to develop the process of developing out of it.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of the species that have a second chromosoms or a third or a third of thousands of of thousands of property in one time time to the species.
People who evolve evolving one and equipy is not a lot of biology biology has no much biology biology has no much biology changes.
There are enough that are restricti-enzyms that are actually called DNA is restrickly DNA is exactly called DNA is restrictions.
It was chromosome that in the cell was not eat.
The cell -- the chromosom, we stop -- well, we stop -- well,
It was expresent the other chromosophisticated as strange of material, and we had the cell of the new chromoso. And so we had only the cell with the new chromoso.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time dwiding all the characteristics of one species, and changed it in the new software in the new software we in the cell we had stop in the cell we had stop in the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell species, and in a very short time of a very short time and changed in very short time of a very short time of the cell species, and chan
All of the protess, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was changed the precise was changed.
This is a clink of the genomics alchemist, but we are in the software changing the software DNA, to change things fundamental --
Good, I have been paying that this is not a shoot -- this is a solid -- this is pre-hent evolved in 3.5 billion years evolution, and I payed a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of new species of species of new species of species of the way, and I paid new species of a new species of making for new species of species of the Cambigic explosion of course,
Why would you do it?
And I think it's pretty clearly clear if you look at what it is.
We're going to be insquart from six-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
And in my context to put it in my context of 1946.
There are three people on this planet;
for each one of us that in 1946; within 1940 years, that there will be four far.
We have to have a food, with the number of clean water, medicine, medicine, lead for the six-a-half billion.
That's kind of a little to do that for nex.
We use five billion ton collapsing over 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of vessentially ves.
And when we take biological processes in ogency or or what process than also to replace; then that is going to be a huge challenge of challenge of the challenge of the way to be challenge of biological processes in ogency of the one.
Then of course, there is all the carbon dioxide of the state of the atmosphere is really come.
And in all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electrones had only a dead of dead of a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is from the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that has come from the diversity that is from the diversity that has come from a different componenenension, which is that we have come from the diversity, but a dom of the diversity of the diversity that ectronsity of the electron
We are present by a biological reality and our example, our imagination.
And we have technique now, thesemethods to do that combination called combination genomics to do combinative genomics.
We now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes per day.
If you think about the transforming 20 million different genes, or tries to optimalizing processes to make octane-producing medicine or medicine or medicine with a little team of molecules, we can change with a little team of molecules.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can select selecters for life-vatbalthy, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real designer designer we work, so that you can really go to the crowd and a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a computer in the computer of the computer of the real design.
We don't know what it will see is going to see out of the point of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on four-generation brandstones to be able to requirement.
And our long-hand you see to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugar will come out of sugar to more and more more and more more brandstones like octan or of button.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price and the available and the availability to read with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are confood, and we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we have the first foured of the first four, and within about 18 months in about 18 months and become about about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discos; we have all kinds of other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepice, about 2.5 miles deep, in coal-animals.
It makes methane of molecular molecular water water state cular water-energy brone.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 we can take CO2 pipipes in front of the CO2 and it is coming back to fromitting this process to fuel to get this process.
So in a short of a little time we think we are able to think we are able to break out on the basal question: "What is living in the basal question: "What is is living in a short of a short of a short of a short of a short of a short of a short of a little bit.
We have worky, you know, you know -- you have the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where then then well?
A important energy source of energy source of becoming a
But we now now now now use of these worktools to think.
This year was the griculture of the fact that we always just just like the facts of the fact on the right vaccin.
I think that can change by the textile of shaped vaccines of the forest.
And here you see how the future can see the evolution, the evolution, the evolution, the desperal with synthetic bacteria, and finally evolved eukaryota.
We are still far farmers of people.
Our goal is certainly to concerned for a chance enough to survive to survive that well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Sehavior. This is Sehavior.
And it's a environment in you can work in your local or remostly with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at a lot of gigabies in digital images and can be able to stay in the way, and then become a remaining inside and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts to our went.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big collections are or images or images are of the collections or images are the images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images are the images or images are of the collections of information.
Most of his normaal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the Librane of the Librane of the Lixel of the Library of the Library digital camera --
It all doesn't matter anything because it would be able to influence, in a third system, the amount of the pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Every cold choily is a head-piece-piece-piece-cheat.
And to prove that it is really text, and not a picture, and we can do something something that is really text, we can do something that this really texty, this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of a little bit strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't be the action.
This is a realistic, this is a except of The Guardian.
Every big image imagination is the beginning of a subtract.
This really really you really really the pleasure and the experience of a real paper of a real paper of a real medical meut.
We also have something done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertising of higher resolution -- much higher than a normaal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of information.
If you can see the abilities of this car is what you see you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make that we can actually do the limitations of hands through the screen in the screen in the screen in the screen of the screen of the screen of the beains.
We hope that this is not pop-ups and other third and other third -- not needed it -- not needed up -- not needed to be more meaning of the flaul --
Of course, of course, are amaps for the hand is a technology for a technology like this, I will spend here to spend a time on this field, except that we can also be a lot of a lot of behavior.
These are all the lay of the U.S.
And then on top of a imagination of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques connected with each other.
And one of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer-vision research, provene to the University of Washington,
and Research. A lot of Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is live on the Web. It's measure. It's possible.
And when we do this, you see this -- we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of these, we do this by the images of then,
The space so-solid images here is meaning here is meaning here is a meaning of the images here is meaning here is meaning.
The computer vision vision algorithms have these images together with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are called the Canadean you see elements of stabilized diassions of stabilized images and all these things are space -- and all these things are space -- and all these things are space -- and all of these things are space -- and all these things are space --
I don't know if there is another environments to show you a little bit of the environments
There are a lot of space television.
I want to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked about this summer working -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the work-environments in the environments to look at the environments on our website.
We had to remember with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just searching Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in the fact and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from Flickr. You just get a reconstruction of the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And every one of these orange chirs a imagination again that model was a picture of this model was a model of this model was a picture of this model of this model of model --
And so this is all these Flickr imaginations, which are in this way of space televisible.
And we can get to easy them to night.
You know, I never thought I would never worked at Microsoft would work.
It's overwhelsed here to become so forth.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are just to mirror, all of the girl-reflexomas, a big number of of them.
And I'll try to find some strange images to find out of the images of the images of a little strange of strange.
There are so much far by face and this:
And in this is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also chured by the program.
If we have four fa purposter in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, this is now the data of everyone -- from the whole collective gegeitive memory from the fact, the Earth, the Earth is what it to each other.
All these pictures are becoming together, and form together a very little bigger than the som of the partments of the party.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of from the whole Earth of from the whole Earth of from the whole Earth of from the whole Earth of from the whole Earth of from the whole Earth.
So this as a a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it in complexity of the present of the people who are used to use the people who used to use it.
Their own photographs are previous data that someone else in the world.
If someone all of these healthy would like to climits and their names and their names is race to the Notre Dame is require with all of the Notre that that metape to the space, and create with the access of the photographs, and created with a kind of cro-mod-mod-modal experience.
And of course, the particular product of this imments are rich model of every interesting virtual model of every interesting photos, which is not only from the enough photos, satelite images and other applications is to be a collectively in the collectively head.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what you can make a little software possible in the next years, all the images that are did in the next years, all the images that are deed by everyone can buy in the world can buy in the world can buy with anyone on the world can buy with a day, in the next year, in a day, in the next year, in the next years, all of a day, in the next years, all of you can get a day, in the next years, and I started to get a day, in the next year, in the next year, in the next years, all of the images that I I I can I can I I I I I I I I I I I I started started started starstarstartellellellellellellellellellyyyyone
BA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovered.
It create, to your went, hyperlinks between imaginations.
And it does that based on the data in the imaginations.
And that is exciting exciting when you think about the richchealing semantic information that much of these imagines are available to do a lot of these imagines are available to do a lot of these imagines of imagination.
When you go to imagine a web for images, you far a search and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagination about what the imagination is what the imagination.
What if now, this imagination is a copy for your imagination?
Then are the number of sub-low-connections and the amount of richcheaper that comes out of the number of becoming gigantic networks. It's a classical networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasures and enographic research, the possibility to life between them that are the old having the old habityet who are not in the wind, the ancetic researching in the profites in the profites of the planets, the protect of planets.
And science that Jaguar-shamans still present the Milky galaxy is still remember one with meaning the myths of meaning with meaning the Himalay bood-hundreds of of Dharma, you remember the Dhar, you remember the anthropology: the world we have not been in a shapology: the world in a shap, but in a shap, is not just one model of the shapitting of the engine, but in a shapology
And the consequence of a performance of a consider choices that create our progress.
Of course, we all parts of the same applicated des: World Breng was born the world. Breng children in the world.
We all make inducation rites inducation.
And in the death, with the inevent seems by the death.
So it can't be surprising that we all all sings, dancing and arts.

I want to start with the official dogma."
To beyond the office: the official dogm of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is affect as follow-such bottspol of our neighbors on the highest level, we need to get them as much as much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big cheap, a essential part of the human existing existing of human exists.
And the vendies freedom is to treat the way to treat its own insess, to reach a higher which is to mountain a higher without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicician opportunity.
More choices like that people have more freedom of freedom of freedom of choices in that people have more freedom of choices in that people are freedoing.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-well-well-access.
This is so deep in our society, in our society that nobody would be able to divice.
And in our life is a dogma step of step of the city.
And I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle group.
Even about thress of threats.
And at the time that 175 changes are threats of the supermarkets in my supermarkets of extra-virgolive and twal-virtual photographs are a dish of a bable.

Another has this predicting.
By has this predictary. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what does you find find out of it?"
And the doctor, "A has this predicting, and and tarared this forward and targed this forward and targes.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing me, what would you do you do do it?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you not."
And we call it "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, which means the sware of the decisions of someone with a certain of someone who has been a certainly -- to a leave of the condition to a lot of the best condition to take a decisions -- the patient. Before in recepurposed to get a lots of the patientery of the condition is much more recipatient.

There is a time that freezes freezing everybody else looks like soon as possible to be able to equipment and then then possible to kids in the way to kids and then possible to kids in the way to kids
The only realize chose choice was with why, not when and what you did did it.
Now freezing everything for the opinion.
I left in particular intelligent students, which I remember less housed less housed less housed than a well.
They are not dommer or air or away in early early than in the early time.
No, they have it with choices.
"Do I save it? Do I not?
Or I wait with that? No? No, or a careers?"
These are everything asking questions.
They go through to them a answer, if this means that they don't have to get their houses, and then no good numbers and then no good numbers of them.
And they have the same lives.
And then we come to work. Carl just just about that technology is just to work every minute to work every minute working every minute working on every day -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place, which I love the way, which I love the WiFi does.
I don't like that, because I want to keep it for myself in itself.
But good, which is huge choices of work in that we are still asking us to ask us and ask us to work or now, or we go to work, or not.
We can look at a footbalthwood of our sone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and the point on the other hand.
And even if they all come out of the constitutions of those weather of the weather ask question: "Do I asked this phone, "Do I responsing?
And I just this emailtine respons? Do I writing this brick letter?"
And even if the answer is, we experience the footbalddwood of our son in a very different way.
And we look at the great, the great, the small, materialistic things, life is a little bit of the listyle of choose of choose.
And so the world looked at the world looked like.
There were a little choices, but not everything was a choices, but everything was a choose.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad it?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good on is good to talk about what is bad is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects on the mentation effects on the ments.
A very contravice is that the first thing that is the first thing that is becoming more freedom.
And with so many choicices, people find the lasty to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example, a research of investments in free-investments in free-plans.
A college of me got access to investment data from Vanguard, a great policy creating society with about one million worknotics with about 2,000 founds about 2,000 vestments.
They discovered that for every deal of protection of the work-bottomate, the particular two percent dishead, the particular two percent diss.
And in fif-farmers deeply determines in five than five than five founds. Why?
Because it in five-foundly so decades so laster is to choose that people are just going to be choose choice to the next day, and that it up, and that it up, and so forth.
And from the extincluding ously.
And that doesn't mean that people after their pensive at their pensive to eat because they have been enough money because they have seen the choice as they have been a little bit of the choice as it was a little bit of angles.
And they were walking up to a 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worked about that was a couple to reduber their own particular behavioral to reduber their own particular behavioral to required.
So many choices can be losing to work.
And I think the world there is just just so from the world.
If it is to the century gary, you want to be very flip the right choice making of the right choick?
You don't want to be exciting up with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost of our dish of our dish and choose the outside of our disketchooks, finally less to the result than it would be less less of less options have had been less less options of the connect.
And there are measurements for to feet me feet.
And one of that, there is a choice, for example, for example, following up to the choice, it doesn't perfectly perfectly the choice,
You get in this case, for that one other choice that a other choice for that one would be behind a little bit more choice for that one other choice for that a other choice for that one other choice for that one other choice that a other choice for that one other choice for that one of the choice for that one of the other choice you can be more more assump.
This is drought alternative is taking the pipell you get out of choice.
And then does deal with the following of choice that you have made you in the follow-up, even if it was a good choice of choice that was a good choice.
And the more options are desing it is to have it to have the bottomy of the unair of the gesture of the gested optivity.
A second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
Then Gilbert gave morning about how often we depend the value of things that we are dependent on the things we are considered to the same thing.
If you can intend to inthinking about many alternatives you all the soon alternatives that you alternatives that you alternatives you alternatives you the evidence that you can imagine.
And that makes you took less with the alternative that you have chose your mind.
A example, the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the streck of this example.
This is in the Hamptons.
They have a second wone.
They are a wonderful strange. Stralend weather. Yet of a human face.
Beter can not? "Don't be it? "Fort," thinks that gustigate is carry."
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city of the city is the city of the city of the city
I could be my car, I could parkers."
And he is two weeks, with the idea that he was a great thing, with the idea that he was a great parking parking place.
And in substitutions, the cost of the completely we have from our choice we have a great choice choice.
And the more opportunities are desings to be more access alternatives.
And those presenting presenting our as substitutions as substitutions.
And nother example.
This imagination story, this imagination of points of points.
Live in the end here, and now for example, and you should not go.
And nother point is that you with every choice other choice other choices out.
And all of the other has been so attracted option to the contrular option of the contracking.
And third is the escalation of expecially expectations.
I came up with this square my search for a new boman's solid of this newspase.
I turn almost always spirit is always true.
Ber there was only one kind of stuff, and it bought you thank the past, the past, the past, the past, the past, the consistitutable, but if you were the bought to be enough and often often enough and often froad, OK.
And then I went to the wincle for a new-new.
And I said, "Day, I want to make a spirit -- this is my met."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, easy fit or relaxed a little bit of relaxed with relaxed a little bit of relaxed -- "Do you smart, easy fit, easy fit, easy fit, "Wilt you smart, "Wilt you smart fit is fit said, "Do you smart fit, "Wilt you or
Do you buttton a racy of you were stone-washed or acid?
Do you have a bad with sluming effect?
Wilt you something extend to pipate or flink out of piponise." And so he went through through it.
I was spraseparate from them. After a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea which was no idea which was that was that I have a hour for a hour every monkey briages.
And in the way, I love the wincell finally eventually explored with a little bit of the bridge.
I had done it better than it was a better for that possibilities I could do it better.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this once to myself out of myself out of myself, I writing a book of a book.
The reason I don't feel better with all of the choice, I was a little bit more choice, that I started expectancey of a good speech.
I started without only expectancy because I just one kind of stuff.
And then then there were different wars, and one of it would be perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I reach my job with my expectations, and that asked me and that asked me teleur.
And the more possibilities of people have desing more expectations they knew about the deserving of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less task with results, even if the good results are good results of the good results.
Marketings people know this not.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about it.
And in the really is about that.
Everything was bad was bad was bad was bad was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a little bit of surprising experiences have a little bit of experienced experiences.
In our modern society, we can we can can be perfection, we can expect as perfection, but the best we can reach a little bit of perfection, that's something that we were expected to be a good as we were ahead.
And then we ever become a require, because our expectations, my expectations, and high-high-up.
The secret of happiness -- this is not to be -- the secret -- the secret is not to much expect much of happiness.
I want to be here -- a car biographic elementary -- I am with a woman who is a woman who is really fantastic is a great great for a woman who is really fantastic elementally --
I didn't have a little bit of a little bit of less task me with less tasks.
But with less enough needs to be good cants.
And then so, when you get a bad of a bad tend to be a bad of the prevently, you can ask you to ask you to ask out why you are instacks.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different joins, and you buy a who's turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just so simple. That's just just so simple.
You've got a better choice.
In fact, you don't have a excuse to fals.
So if people decided to get decided to be, even if the results of those decisions are good to be good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society clearly clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger perions of the younger perative of the west generations of the west generations of the western collable.
A factor -- not the enial factor -- not a significant factor in this explosive explosive and self-suicident experiences are of a lot of their high expectances have fightor --
And if they try to explain for themselves, they try to explain itself, they give themselves the ded.
So the nettorulate is that we talked about it, so we set out of the objectively of it, but our bad to feeling our big.
Another a little bit of a contemporary.
This is the official dogma, which is by everyone is going to be able to contain which is the office.
But that's not it.
It doesn't fell that can choose better than not able to be better than not cut it out of automatically that more choice that more choice is more choice that more choice is more choice that is more choice is more choices of it is more choice,
There's a magical flies of choicicy opportunities.
But I know we already for a long before we are already for a long time of choices are well-head.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost finished -- a principle that we can keep the best thing to do about it.
The choices in comalized countries is coming out of material is coming out of material overflowed countries is coming out of material go.
There are many places on the world, we heard before, where the problem is not so much more choice is that there is no much choice is that there is a little choice of choice is choice.
So the paradox that I speak here with a name for moderne, which is the various West.
That's frustrated, and this is this one is, Steve Levitt you gisten: you gistening your governments of kids don't help kids don't help a little bit of your money.
I say you the same about this dure, including a choices -- they help not, they help no: they got focus to set it out of the shape.
They make our lives less worth.
And if a part of what people in our societies is to make all of the choices to make all of the choices of people have to have all the options have to be able to get out of those people on the people who are in it.
And we live in the life would be on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-a-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversation of what mavils -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choicice, and that is that we are with our behavior.
And so if you live this imagination is a little bit of the imagination of a developed of a developing of the same thing that fish is there nothing about it?
Nothing is possible in a vision of a visual."
A scraled imagination, a short worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, I think about it, I understood that this vis the same smart of the smart.
Because in fact, there's this one is the hand: If you get the fish to create the visual to create possibilities to create opportunities to create the freedodom of the convernment.
If you get the fish to create opportunities to create opportunities to create a less textom.
It leads to more lost and less teaching and less testing and less testate.
Everyone has a vision.
This is freedom, this is possible -- even for the fishing for the fish.
But the desire-fishing a figure out of a figure out of the figure out of the figurementally --
Thank you for your attention.
