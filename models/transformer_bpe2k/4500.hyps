And I was a year I was this two dia's going to show that the pools that the pools that the last three million years about the last three million years of the VVS, with 40, with 400-percent cromroms.
But this is the nice of this specific problebecause the same thing because the diddness of the saw of the saw of the saw of the saw of the the diddnat.
The ifar on the North pool is in sex is in the cloping heart of us global heart of us global climate.
It looks like the winter and crimpt in the winter and crimpt in the som.
And the next dia I show show you a quick of what the last 25 years is the last 25 years is happened to happy.
The permanentire perions in him.
And as you see, it it from the dark blaw.
And that's the journey of the winter.
And the crimpt in the sour.
And the soddyed permanent, five or years or older, is a blood purpose of the body single him
And in 25 years is the of this to this is the one of this to this is the one of this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this
And that is a problem because the beoms are woman Icrather and the North Icrather and there is a very big amount of a very big amount of wombon on on the dead, by the death, in methththese.
And the totale with the totale of a low-in-followed in the atmosphere, would be a followed to remember the atmosphere to write the atmospot writing the atmospose to the atmosp.
In some once indiepe mate Alaska religs rels to all of the water.
And then then the winter Professor Katey Walter Walter Walter with a different task with a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different of the University of the University with a different team to a different team to a different team to a with a different of the University of the University Walter in the other team to a with
Whoo! She is is "OK. It's a or we will be that will be to.
A reason is that this is that this huge called "warms Greenland from the ornow,
This is a smell purrid-felt felt felt fellow

This is the Kangergerlussuain South South Greenland.
If you want to know how the seems because the seems because the landscious, it's the place where the seems that is the sea a to the sea a couple of the see.
These stroms needed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.

There are more stroms.
But when they were sure to definite, it it was also the drinkater.
In California was a very, a remination of 40 percent in the Sierra.
It's really really really in the water reserires reserires.
And as you could learn the predictions, the predictions.
These world has been been to a behavior to a behavior.
And the number of course about the world is very very instep with a ungirels and never seeing a quice.
And the last 30 years in the last 30 years than in the predict 75 year.
This pattern is followed big.
If you look at the same thing from a historic context than you can see what happened.
And in the last five years have 70 million years have 70 million ton CO2 to CO2 hour.
25 mics every day in our oceans, Kook at the ocean, Kook is is the Stille Oceasy of America, and and and then the America, and and the the India is a behavior, there's a behaviors of the ocean in the ocean in the ocean.
The only is a lot of the surface warming warming of the Earth, which is the support of phospited the sure of pictures of picture.
Oil is a problem, and stead is the cool is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two gricult of China.
And there was a predict to build a lot more steenkools and building a lot more parts.
But we see a bomb.
These are the cities of the ban was a ban was a number of the defined in the last last years and where great.
There's a political strow a political stross the gang in our country.
The cools -- and ololie-industry gave years of 250 million dollars from "whether from "whee."
And that image to me something about something about something about something like me to me something about something like me to me.
And the chemerged me thuis in Tennessee, about four billion literally model.
You have the news that the news in the news that news is the news
This is the one after one after the biggest of America.
This happened the Kererst.
One of the adversation of the Interterms of the Kerst was dead.
Video: ""Frosty the steenkman is a cool, operatory whead.
He's government is a conversation here in America, and he are works to make our economy grow.
Frosty the cities is with the day is with the day whether with the day whether
He's a paid and wrockes and working work."
Here's a big particularly of the steenknew in West Virginia day.
The largest malker of the land is the country is the large of Massey Coal.
Video: Dong-such -- "Let me me like "Let me me like Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reatatat, they don't know what they don't know about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimatter to be a touching campaigs on touched to told your tom.
This is a pieck of a pieck of a pieck of a pieck of a pieck of a pieck of a pieck of a pieces.
And the Video COLwory, we see the climate changed the climating of our saw for our saw and the saw for our saw and the things that we had to see the climate change.
And that's the reason is why the reason's going to give a gigantically behaviors to read the light to the light and the light and the likely and requickks.
Feit is not cool is not smarknew sick.
We find that the whether is -- and it's a little bit more left is a crock cke.
So, you don't have a climate about climate change.
And that but about us to gover.
Video: Actector: Schonenkool, you have a lot about it.
So let's look at this hypermoderne cross this hypermodernal cools.
Fantastic! The machines make a lot of law?
But that's the sound of write coolools technology.
And the fact that the fact that the fact of the first warming of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth is changed of the Earth is the surpractice that you see here here is all of the Earth.
And you look at the well, this is the scenkools of today day.
Al Gore: Eintually pitive alternative alternative to our economic extremities and that was in the area of national follows.
Video: A: A: America wrong in crisis, the national neat-national refil, the climatter crisis.
The rowed on this room, is our dependent is our dependence of phospited and cols and independed and heath,
But now there's a bigger solution to be a new solution to be a lot of this.
And the America of 100 percent write electricity to 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to get a plan that we get us to get us and the surface of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And it was a solution that is a solution of the same thing to provivice.
Repower America. OOh,
Al Gore: And the last last last one.

Al Gore: There is a old African's Africand, "If you know, you want to be write you want to be everything.
If you want to do a to, you want to do a toward."
We need to go to go and and quickks.
Thank you.
And I gave years I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I believe the back to come back with a upon the same thing that machine works.
So here is a lot of degenes that there is not waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment, 27 miles in the comb.
It has to the ombs were able to naboowns that were less than a billion.
Enorm ambition,
This is the machine Genee:
We took the photograph Bangs in detectors in detectors where I work. It's called ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSPPSSSS.
Spectacular picture of ATLASSSSSSSSome in the scale that you can see the scale that you can see the scale that you can see the scale.
And in 10 september year we were the machine for the first time we were going to go to the first time to the machine for the first time we have the first time to the first of the first year we were the first time to the first of the first time.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that gone for a farm in the controlllam.
It's a picture of the first particularly particularly that helped the LHC ging, and with operate a botest with a piece of the LHCvalvalue in the detector in the detector in the detector in the detector and the ded.
And the other words, when we saw that photograph on 10 September we worked on the machine, which is a huge exphotograph is a huge exphotograph that picture.
I don't know if this is the gricult crote or somebody to Google and saw the internetpage and saw that the internetpage in that the internetpage of things like this.
And that means we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientipact with a scientipact have a cultural pacts of a scientipact that that means
A week later we had a problem with this gololds.
And that behaviors 13 thousand camps when the machine on on follows.
The engineers will say, "Niet you will say, "Niet which are small."
They can do that because they can superident his temperaturs.
So on me in 27, then the room than the space between the gars that can behaviors that strics that strics are afficult that strice.
In a of the connect between the news in the LHC, in the LHC, and sat the LHC,
And then it was a blood hear, and there was indeed electrical weight, and then the 13 thousands of the 13 thousands of the well.
This was the result.
This is another inpresssent if you realize that magnets more than 20 ton on the wear, and they were about 30 center and they were about 30 center and they were about 30 center and they were about 30 center and they were about 30 centerns and they were about 20 center than 20 centers, and they were about 20 century to be about 20 ton the phahaping.
We have about 50 monkeys about 50 monkets.
We had to do them from stories, what we did we ded.
We all all the time they all all the first part.
Now they are back to wead.
Eind mics will be the LHC againtace.
We will be able to take him and we can expect and we can go to be a craise that we can go to go to the build and the build of the universe.
Well, natural -- of course, which is that inssound the debath needs about the value of scientific research.
I think the fact that the fact is that we are going to be a little bit than the value of things like the LHC.
I show the last words on the last scientiper Humphrey Davy, die, diverss, des the des of the value of his own own own own own own own own own own ling the world was Michael called ""Nichael this is that the example, ""No is that the finitely excccouldn't be a lot of our exccishhome of our and that are are are are not very very much.
Thank you.
I would like to ask you to ask you back to ask up to your child, when you know, you played with blocks at the blots of the job.
And then you discovered how you to move and they were paid and behavior, you know, you know, you know, you can actually get to the let and hangs and hang with hang and hang the hang and hangs of space and then you can get the let and then the deservicips.
Rimals is a crible because with the world because with the world to understand the world to understand our hears.
If a inform inform inform by the name of physical interaction with objects -- with my advision and my advision and my advision and my members of Kanalii -- what we started asking about a computer -- what we would ask a computer that we would ask asked out of the music that we would have a lot of a write that we can excishome with the information and that that we can can be a little bit of the pulation with a a little bit of the things that that that that that that that we do with with with with with with with with with with my advisipping of the same same thing that that that that that that that we we we we we can can can can do -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I beginning inininininciencroad the kind of the "The The The
and and ordered order we want to do you want?
These question that we have been so so we decided to look at the answer of Siftables.
Cort is a Sifttable a Siftable a catch of a cookyly.
They can be able to the hand they can follow each other movement and they can movement a wirird and they were a wirird and turn a wire and turn the act.
It was the physical hands is the physical hands can be definited by the physical treate.
Boddoms are Siftables a new new ecosystem for the way to the wage of digital inforest.
And that these hulpes a more physical different, and making the way of their movement and other and and other thing we movement and other thing we moved, and what we movement to discovered them are different and interacting them are different and explainttable.
I will start with some some of some simple example of examples of examples of the environment.
This Sifttable is including a video to tell a cope and another, and other and other and another, and other place.
These interaction of course are consciped to each other people.
Indians can be able to be able to each other interest for each other.
If they can be working on the work, they can also do this and then then what soil.
She movement and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting interesting of these interaction, the use of these interaction, the use of a smallalls of a smallall, as it was a little bit like a little list of a smalls of a smallalls of a smallallall,
In this example of three Siftables are three and I can use them to and I can use them to go to go to go to be small to good,
If we have been thinking about what we go back to go back to the back.
There are some craise cople for the education, and making the education and global mathematics where we want to get the ability to produce things we want to get things to see things that we want to see the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the enti
And here I was the developing of a Fibonacci by a simple program is a simple program mate.
Here we show a spel that a crab is crabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of a wrong on every Siftable, and and then the words are controllled in a words in a words in a work.
Well, it's about 30 seconds is a very record, and and different, and a new series of models with heart model.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excurrent to the Media Lab, and I'm going to make it out of the Media and I have a video of a video of video and make a video of the the Media and I make it out of the the Media and I make it out of the Media and I have to make it out of the Media and I
They were working on it.
And one of the most interesting things of these future is that people have no instructions that people needs needs to have have to have needs to have have instructions of these future.
All what you have to say is "Moo's work" and they know exactly what they need to do it.
Here are some other people on the tests.
And that's our both both bate, really, reggegestraise.
And it looks like he was the Siftables well,
And for him this was only blows.
Here's a interactive scree whether
We wanted to do a platform for the late of tool.
This is Felix that demonstrice.
He can care new carakters in the scene, by the Siftable with that carakter of the table.
Here he shows the sion.
Video: The son up.
David Merrill: now he has a tractor in the scenne area
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed daan! Yeah!
And then the scue of Siftables and the nature and then then the carakes that can responding with each each other -- and Wath and the carake.
DM: and and so his own story and tell tell you.
Video: Hol!
DM: It's a story with a story with a next end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end on the end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end with a him.
and he decided how it was a big.
Video: The cats frow up.
DM: The last example that I will have a synthesizer and soundation that we have been across the recent of Siftables and make a sound of the lead, and present such a sound of the basic and pressssent such such that I rerememember.
Eengineer, has has a different variations, which you can use your wants to use your want.
These happy can in the lege Siftables are injected so that you can see the pattern to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be injected.
And you put a sound in the pattern by the pattern Siftable to be controllling the effects of a controlll.
They are sound to a sound and including and including the couldn't be a celebrate to canc.
Sometimes the already effects like tempo and volume that are the whole pattern.
Let's look at the next thing --
Video: We started with a liad of a lead places in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
Now I feel the basic.
Video: Well, I feel what I feel what I mean, I work what I mean.
Video: DM: And now I can get the filter of the filter of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the the effect of the the effect of the effect to the effect the effect of the the effect of the filter of the the effect of the effect of the filter of the the effect
Video: I can make it very quickly it very quickly by the tempo blow.
Video: Well, I cople I get the filter of the filter of the phililo:
Video: I can be pattern the pattern requickkile it playing.
I don't know how to expit doesn't explor, but I can make improvision, it very very long and make a very long and make a very long long and make a very long long and make a very long long and make improvision,
And the end of the dimmmmms of the volume Siftable to link the same of the same thing.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make my passion from new people's interfaces that are connects that are depares are departies to the way our brain and body's work.
And today I had to show you one needs in this new election in this design design and with some of some mobilities that we develop and are in the lab.
And the dad I want to talk about to a very new generation is only the real new generation is to a very new generation for the interacters, which is the interacters, the information that information to our world to our world and the things like we want.
I dangerous of heart.
I look at the next to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to you.
I write write it.
But, my work, but also my work, but also much more than that,
My whole country, I am a lot of write and I don't think that that will changed to change that will changed to change that that will change.
And there's under a more expresent something happened in my life and carry career, which I had my work with my work with my work with my work with my work work.
And the began to a book, I have a book a measure moire: "Ets, Bidd," Beminnen," "E, which is very in a very very in the world and international working about my first working about my first working about and international working about and a very book about the world and international work.
And the population is that people are going to be demust be like I have to do it.
Because what --
People to ask me and questions and you don't know that you can't be be success?
By not bang you don't know you can be able to be able to be a book more a book more a book more more more more more to be able to head a book at the warm of the warm that people will never get to write the way to write you can can be a book more a book more more a book more more a book more a book of the life, and you w
And you don't know that.
Every rigger, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Well, course, that would be very very -- I remember me that I was a tiend, I was a tiener -- I was told me -- I wanted to be a told me that I wanted to be a told me --
People said, "Ben you don't get your success you get success to be success?
Ben you don't know know that you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a big?
And you don't know that you don't know you can be able to this is a lot of that there are something from the puts of your built on the puts of your built on the putting with your build with your your build with your your own bit?"
Its in that that excover.
In the corns is my answer to ask this is the questions on this is "Yea."
Yeah, I'm bang for all those things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things that are enough things.
Alth,
But I'm also a lot of different things are not not not know what a lot of other things for all of all.
For example, and other engineer, and other things.
But what I mean, I ask ask myself to the last time that angst today to the last today of the last today.
Is the rational eas?
Is it the logical that somebody is big, which is a job for the work for the Earth?
What is so for creative process, we are creative to make our effects to the effects of the effects of otherwise in other spectivel, something that is not going to do a lot of other working about different.
And I was a now, my father. He was written and I can't remember me to be in the 40 years that he was ever ever ever somebody has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever someone for somebody was was not ded.
And so I say, "Yohn, how is the with your chemicy?"
No, so it was not about it.
Om fair fair to be a craise of the century of the century of the century, not the reputation for stuff for study for stuff for stuff for stuff to be a cooks.
Sceat, which is a kind of reputation.
Not only a write other creative people have creative people have dealing the reputation of the reputation of instable.
And you look at the grim is the grim of the most magnific creative of the 20th century.
And many stiven young body, follow by their own future.
And even degenes that doesn't have a self-order place for the garar,
In the last interview for his own own own own said, "Miler: "Moer: "Met every my books is a piece."
And that's notice what to say about you about you know, about you know,
But of this kind of this kind of challen't look at the kind of this kind of of expactly that we don't look at it.
We've heard the first once and have heard the first thing with a little bit accepted.
The head sense of course, which is creativity is that creativity is with list list and that a artistening to exists to exist.
So why I want to ask anyone here today you can ask you with that idea with you you can do with that idea with you you can ask you to ask you --
With you that OK?
Because I think about a good about me, I think about a lot of course, I don't have a wrong day.
I think it was the wead,
And also also also a lot of course.
I don't like to see that this this century is so good.
We can creative and a lot of concerned to life.
I know that it for me, I know that the situation, in my situation, without to the dark would be to be able to livick that day.
And then the fashim in my carror,
Ga but I am am a young let me a far.
I can have a lot of four decar is a decar
And the way I think that I'm going to be everything I now now now now now now now in the work that is the work that is the work that is the work on that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends -- I can be able to well.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you know that if you know you know you know you know the during for your hours to the dark of the drank.
So I don't want to do not.
I love me love me love to work with the work where I love the work of work.
The question question is, "Hoe?"
Well, I think of long think, I think about the conclusion I can go through the crite with a psychological protection in the process of the process infectly in the process.
I have to think the write that I have to see a follow and my government and my government and my moval angine for the reactons in my future.
I have the last year, I have been able to do that we have to do that
I am in the history is a lot of deeps and deeps to see or other people's maybe a better way to see or others to help to help people have creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My secttook me built me to the old Grieks and Romens.
Let me because it's a long and invited and invitial story.
In the time of the old Grieks and Romen's enen't creativity was creativity was a henduring self.
Moodddle that creativity was a godnment, which was really, unknown to the ments of a required to the ments and invented to refollowed to the human rereddenly representation and inking.
The Grief of these decisions of creativity and creativity "demonen."
And I believe that he belief's incredibly believed that he had a demone that he words influence words in the "
The Romens had a spectunch a spectoo.
And we have to have a decise to creative to creative to be a geni."
The grapport is that the Romen's not a geneat, without person on on the Rom.
In their believed was a genevily of magical godnments that are exhim in the murs of the ately of the artist.
A little bit Dobvious of Dobvior.
If the artists was working on the working the genassion of the geney.
And the fact he gave to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly what I was talking about having the psychological protection to the results of your work.
IIImaging.
The artists was so in proteciscism.
If you don't work work and you wouldn't all the easy is not all the easy --
Idern a wrong that a unfact, you had a unface that a unfact that a unfact that a unfact that a unfact that a unface that a unfact that a unface of the whether you had a unfact,
With you work on your work working, you know, you know, you know,
Idern that whether you a nogal genure.
And then the time is that the Wests and creativity was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything --
There is a very newed a very new: the individual ments is the middle of the universe and major and mysteries.
Go for mystic wead, in the godnment, independs from the godnment.
And that was the beginning of the rational house of the rational humanism.
People beliefs that creativity of individual foundation of the individual.
And for the first first in history about artists is about artists who were not going to say that they were not have a genet.
And I have to say that I have to say that I have to be a big front of this big follow.
And one person, one person, one person, one of individual that he well, he well, the essentially is the cell of the essentially mystery, of everywhatever is a little bit of everything -- creative and the exccinclucity for a lot of answer to be a swer to be a city for a city for answer to be a cle of the cell.
Also, you ask the son on on the son on on the son on on the son on on the son on
Every's regiven to gigantic provions and are unprestant exprestatments to exprestate.
And I think these present the last 500 years artists has been made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think is that I think is the question, "What nu?"
Cuncus we do this different do?
Cunck we go back to a old beginning of the relationship between the ments and creative mysteri?
Maybe not.
Wellip we can 500 years rational high high high high minutes to the 18 minutes --
And the maybe there are in the audience that are people who are the audience about the idea that have about the idea that has been a case with what the idea that foot of what artions with what artists and inspirls and inspirerces with what artire works and medical of the working about the idea of the environment.
It seems me that I don't have to get you in that will get out of them.
And I ask it me me.
Why nois?
Why would we do that day?
The quick is so much holds all the other elections of the totally divivide of the creative process.
And everything has a little bit to create a little bit -- so in fact, so that the creative process -- that creative process is not always remember to be rationally rationally rationally rationally rationally rationally rate.
And that some of the parance parance of the parangges.
I have under the great American ananimage Ruth Stone of Ruth Stone was did.
And they are dik in the newspire of life, they write write they did.
She told me about her you, at the plattold the plattold and
Some on the follow on the follow on the work, and they heard a dised to the long time.
It was so so if there's a big golf of a big gololf lly.
And so it was going to be gololf, the land to her fu.
She feeling the ground that the foot was going to whether and whether that her in that time one thing to do it for her life.
And they were running to the shaped by the girl, and they had to get to see and then then then it possible and paper and then then then it move to get and then then it to see and then they had to see the paper and then they had to see and then it to see the papaper than and then then then it to see and they had to see the power than it to get and then it out and then it out
When it was dised by her home by her hold her holven her environment.
Sometimes they didn't have enough enough enough one.
Then running and ring the next and rate it is not the house.
And in the moments that is the shaped by her heart the many of the many -- in her words -- in her words -- to a other diter.
And I was a lot of though -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are the story -- that they were deaed the girl.
And then she was in house to look at and paper and page the disound.
You're going to get a potile that moment they had a potil.
And with her other hand, and then told me me shaped the shaped the air.
They paid the dead, and he was a little bit to the back back back to her botty, and they were the surface it it was sure it
And in that I came out the girls that in my my my my paper in the paper in the paper in the wall.
And then I heard that I thought I thought I thought I was so follow!
So I works my creative process is not a medium!
I am a musile's a while every day in the same time and then it with blood and transformed with blood and transformed and and transsssoddy.
But even in that day's well, I have a lot of experience a lot of experience had.
You will be able to do it is that that are creative that there are creative ideas in your opams of a brothern of a brothern to explore.
What is that then is that for bron?
How can we use it without that we can be working on the thing we can be working on the question.
And in a way that we do for us to is?
The best contempora is example that I can think I can think is the To Waith Waits.
A couple of years ago for a time I was a time for a time.
We had this gover.
And to get a big part of his life is a big part of his life is unample of the connection of the making of the making of all of all of all the making of the including on the including that including him in him that him in him that expultive in the surface of the surface is that example.
And the 'd like the 'd like To to the To o cristiger.
And in Los Angeles Angeles Angeles about the strong of the process, and changed the process.
And as he heard there is so road a fragmentary of a melodie.
It was a decise like inspiration that is a dep, untib, wellend.
It was a beautiful and he wanted to fasthor.
But that didn't know that I don't know
He didn't had no paper tile -- not paper, not a too.
And the whately spance to get again, against the m: "I was the meloil that turn the mounds.
I don't well, good enough I can't be not."
He didn't get a panick, but he didn't stop the entire mentale to do something news.
He looked at the air, and he heard and said, "Sorry heard that I heard that I heard it it was going to be the study --
"Denk you really really really now I can write a low?
If you really want to do that this love is a lot of course, you have to do a lot of time I have to have a time for you have to have a time for your high for you have to have a little bit of the time.
Not not, somebody else -- somebody else.
Ga buurs to Leonard Cohend." And I love the process.
And the work is the same thing is the same knowledge with the bigon.
But the sware spance that creative process, he was a regular distance he distance distance of the genion.
It was going to read the shaped and leave the house and living the well.
To realized that there was no reason was not to go through the pract.
It could also a wonderful wonder, bizarch working on the maybe a kind of conversation between To and the perform of To to help myself was not help to be a lot of To was not help to be a lot of To to be a c
And that story has my way from work.
I have a profise of hapes of hahad.
I was in the middle in the write process of Ets, Biddom.
And I give a case I remember in wants in want.
You don't want to do that whate, you don't want to think it's a different, you know, the very very ramp of the book book.
Not six bigger challenge of course,
I wanted to do it all the whole project of the whole project of the whole project of the project of the project of the project of the project
And then I remember me To that are geney, and I decided and I decided to way.
I wendd me from my guy and rip and rip to a lege of the cridge of the cridge of the cridge of the crip of the crip of the crip of the crip of my crip and I walk
And I said hard: "Lister dom, we know that if we know that if this book not only is that if you don't know that if you don't just just by mice.
You can see that I have everything I have to have everything I have to have to me.
And I can't be not to be not to be able to it.
If you think it's a behome to you have to do your your your your your your your thing to do you can do it to do you have to do your thing to do you have to do your your your your your your your your your your thing to do you can do it to do your your thing to do it in

I write I write because it's a very simple my work.
And in the notuls are dead, and magine that are very mutor is a change."
Ta--- United -- United here, it here is on notice --
Eeuws were in the North African woostine people are people people sams to maybe maance to heile mazing the music music
And Urand and and urs up to the oched to the ochallenge glors.
And that was always great, because the dances were professionals.
But some of them -- some of the echallenge for a bununtil
A of those dance of those danger.
You know, you know, I mean, what I mean, you know, you have a perforform with a perforform.
It was like the time and the time and the dancer and the dancer by a poor.
And he don't know that that the thousands of nights and now now now now now all of everything thing is all the thing --
And he don't have a long long long bigger bigger only a ment.
In head, him him him him him him.
A governs a govern.
If something destide -- whether people who was Dan was Dan was Dan and and in cird and in cirl: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because that was for high.

Preacions what we need to have to have needed to have need.
And let is the dance is the dancer is the next morning to the next morning to the dinary day to ordinary to the dinary lage to hours of the otends to hours to be more heart to the way.
And in that moment he was a whate, with a bad with a bad that wouldn't be more to be high high and will be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the well.
Maybe no one one God will never do a little bit of the thank his dances.
What has to the rest of his life of his lif?
That's hard to be difficult it.
And that's really really really excells for a creative for a creative and wall.
But so the thing is not to be not to be able to be a lot of it.

I just just invents that I have been day.
And the last months I have a book, I was worked at a book that a lot of a long long long long where many long to be a lot of a long time to excish.

And then then thank you "Olet "Oly"
I believe I believe me of hear.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olet
You know, I had a little bit about a few of these projects, about a few projects, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovered and what is the discovered of the new sets of genes.
We started a new point of a new point of the biology thing about biology to the digitalizes, and now we try to try to a new fassion in biology and now now now to a new new physics and synthetitions of life.
So we have been trying to do the big questions to do the big question.
"What is something that I think about a lot of biolos have to understand what a lot of lives.
We have different care are trying to minimal components.
We're now now now the excinate 20 years about the digitalish.
And then we have the human genoom has been sequence, the analoge world of the analoge world of the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask question, we can we do new general, or we can create new life life to create this digital universe of this digit?
This is the circle of a colorator, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the colorder of a challenge that can exploratory in a laboratory in a laborator.
And we try to look at a night or we can get to a night to a night to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to a night or we can get to look at a night or we can get to look at a night or we can get to look at a night or we can get to look at a night.
We can be in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or so so so so so that are there.
But if we look at the metabolic cirpull is relative to the uncrapy.
Geloof me, this is simple --
But when we can look at all the genes that we can see that this is very unvalue that this is a lives, it would be a living cell the cell would be sure to level a lives.
We decided that the enduring is that the only rout, to synthetise this chromosphere so we could be able to be able to be able to be able to the components to ask the most fundamental questions that we can can be a few fundamental questions that we can can be able to be a couple the ents of the most fundamental quest
And so we started asking with questions with question, we started a chromospsynthetis?"
Staking the chemy that we have been a very very molecules that we never have been able to do it.
And if we can do that do, a chromosphere, "DAAs are "DA?
A chromospoke is trick is a piece of chemicicic inclucky and chemicallally.
So, our education, of the digitalise of life is exponential education.
Our moving the genetical code code code code write -- but is is the fun of the genetic code --
And the last point would be on this moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
We're here more than 15 years ago,
There were a number of city for expincluding a bio-ethical future to the first experiments.
But it turns out the synnthese.
There are tims, machines in the world that are small the world that little pieces of DNA making about 50 letters in lengs, and it's a degeneration process, so how long long old you how to be a lot of course, and the more follow.
So we had to make a new method to make a new stuff of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the old folds.
And this was our first point of the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi P
That's a small of four four bacteria --
We had been the stuff -- we had the stuff --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spannation was a including piece of chemical stor in the bacteria and the bacteria and the bacteria and virtual cogs and virtual calls and vironments and vironments and virtual ckes and virtually virtual sts and virtual calls and vironments of the bacteria and
The virical particles works when I losing the cells, they came back to the cells, and then the E.
I was under the lows in the olief that model with the oloil that model but I said that model for good good quicks.
They law more than you low.
So why we think this is a situation is where the software are own heardware are are building a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much great.
We wanted to build the follow bacterial chromospone.
And that's more than 580,000 letters genetical coal.
And so we can build them to build them in cassetts in the cassettts that we could see the cassettts that we could be able to experienced the cassetts --
And to understand what the stuff is a components of a living cell.
The design is crucial crucial and if you beginning with digital information in the computer than that has to be very accustate information in the computer of the computer of the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer than that are recumberial information in the computer than that is is a lot of the computer than that we have to
When we went to the first first of the first time in 1995 was the stand-precision was one follow a 10,000 ages.
And we could have been able to resequences 30 fours to the original sequence had been used to use the way.
And the third design is the design of stuff that are 50 letters are the other stuff with all other stuff with all other stuff to build a little bit of a little bit of a little bit to design that we need to build them and samounds that we can have to build them and samams to build and and samams that we can can have to build the other stu
We design design to design up up to be able to live in the prices of the connects of this is a lot of design and we live in the parts of design.
Maybe you have a lot that we have a parentmer.
And I think about a four letter four genetical code: A, C, C, C, C, C, C, C.
Trios of those letters costs for the rurun of the regons -- that there is a simple of any aminoxyoxyoxyoxyoxy-ur.
So we can use the genetical code to write words to write words --
Aancestern we just just just me just just micult just just mice.
Some were teleured that there were no dised that there are no diset that there are no diss.
We have these stuck stuck that we can get them to take them with enzys.
There are enzyms that they are reparttation and in each other people.
And we started stuff out of the stuff with stuff with stuff and then then the poor and then you have study and and you have study and then you have study and then then sets from 2000.
In every cray crocky we could we have a survival that we could do them because we would like a process to create a process -- that will be very robuy -- that will see you very robit’s --
We try to try to get the point of automatic.
So this looks like a basketbalale.
And so we come to come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 agets -- then you don't don't have to be so more in E.
And that exercalls the modernal prise of the molecular biology.
So why we global raise to other mechanism.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombination is that is used by the biology to the biology to the biology to reparents, and can foot them and can foot them and can food.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organized Saged Deinoccus radiodurance that three million radiodd-rad million radioddduring the change.
And that you see in the both paneze, my chromosphere is just a cromosphere.
12 ot 24 later later later he was going to do it again, and then it was going to be exactly as it was going to be able to be able to the first later.
There are thousands that these arns.
These organized to be surface surface are surface.
They can be in a vacum.
I know absolutely that there is that there can be able to exist, that can be movement, a new aquatically entire environment,
Well, you know, the way that there's a lot of is, there's a lot of is, there's a lot of is, there is there.
Here's a is a deal microph ph of the molecule that we have been made these process, which is with these calls -- which is with the right of the stuff with the right of the stuff in ded.
Good works for that they can can foot them carry on the carry choicicks.
This is not electronen-microscope photographotographotographotographotographotographotographotograph photographotograph.
It's a big molecules that we can see the with a light that we can see the with a light.
These are pictures, about a period of sours of sources of sours.
This is the audience we are under uncally.
This is more 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the gricult molecule ever ever ever ever ever been a thousand-structure.
It molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would be the present point with a 10-point point without of the genetic pages of the genetic code code code the genetic code code of the genetic code the the genetic code of the the genetic code of the the genetic code point with a 10-point point of the genetic point of the geneti
How do we started a chromosphere, we started a chromosphere and we he?
With a four is the sodly is a craise of easy.
With a bacterneeds a lot of invice.
It's also simply if you can be able to eukyo, you whether the cells and you just the ckers and you can just the other in, and and you know what you can see it as a cells and you you know what you know what you can can do it and do is what you can see the cells and you you you can see the ckers and you can be a lot of cell and you can can feel out of the cel
And we can see the bacteria is the chromosphere, but we have integrated in the cle, but we have a follow that we can can have a follow mospling a cromosople to a cle the cell of a cell to a cell of a cell of the other.
We have a chromosphere, and we have a micromosed of a micromoss.
These are about this is about a lot of people and musics and musizs.
We foot what extra genes that we could cromospose for this chromospose for this chromosphere.
We have the converted, with enzyms to make all the white study stuff and stuff
It was women women in the cell when we will stop the cell imagine the cell imagine -- and you can can be able to value the new chromosphere in the cell.
We even thought he was to talk about it to be able to do it to develop the process what would have to developed the process of the process to developed the process to developed it to develop it.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all of the chromospose to have a second chromosphere or a third of the da, which they were thousands in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time in one time to the species.
People that evolution is as if there's one or one teachs have a lot of biology and crapy.
There are enzyms that restricti-enzyms are are enough DNA reverters.
It turned that in the cell was not not to it.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stopped -- which we stopped -- which we stop.
It was expressent the other chromosphere and the other chromospoke material, and we had to finally the cell with the new chromosp.
He was blaw the genes that we had to get up in the genes we had strong.
And in very short time and all the calarakists of the ene species and changed a completely species and changes the new software that we stop the new software we strong in the cell we had strong in the cell of the new software that we strong in very celarake.
All l whwhite changes, the membrans -- we the genetical code -- we was exactly the cissue was exactly changed.
This mag than the clink as genomics are in state, but we are in state, and we are changed to change things that is to change things that fundamente.
Well, I have been a lot of third that this is not a new -- this is -- this is -- this is the example, and I have a new new new new story, and I have a new explosize that we might be a new new new explosion of Camample, and I have a new species of the new species that is a new species of design and design design species that is a new species of design and a new species of design species of a new species where this is is is a new species of a new species of a new species of of of of of a new
Why would you do this do?

And I am the place in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet,
for each of us that are in 1946, in 1940 years will be four years of us are four in 1940 years of us are four in 1940 years of us are four in 1940 years of us in 1940.
We've disaphahase with the food food water medicine, medicine, medicine, and brand--half milli-half milly.
And that is really that for needs to do that for needs to do that.
We use fibillion ton cold, more than 30 billion fath ollow.
And that's 100 milos per day.
When we can do biological process, in ogency or whate, or or while is to remember that is is a huge of a huge excited to be a huge of the challenge of the well.
And then course of course, which is the cools of the stor that are in the atmosphere is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really work.
And as a lot of our world's discovered that we now now now now now now now I would like to see if I would like the design design that would like the design design and the future.
The electronicaindustrics had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is explored from the animals that is expresent that is to the animals that is a lot of the diversity that is a do.
We are except by a biological realized by biological reality.
We have technique thank they crapid synthesemethods to do so genomics to do the combination of the combination genomics
We now now now now now now now now now now now to build a million chromosome day and a day and a day and a day and a day and a day and a day and make a day and mosome day and a day and we can make a day and make a day and a day a day and a day a day and we can make a day and make a day
If you can make the exciting of 20 million different genes or tracking to make occoptimalise to make octon to make octor produced to producers, new faccins, new molecules we can changed with a smallall, we can can change the last 20 years of the last 20 years of science.
And it's only is only standard system.
We can select for life for life is chemic or brandstoptic or productive, equictivaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen image of what real design design design and we can do about the connect that you can really go and a new kind of the computer and a new kind of the computer can design design and design design in the computer of the computer can design the computer of what we can can design the computer can design the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what you can can do you can do to do that that that that that that that that you can really really do about the real design to do about the real real real real design and a new new new new new new new new new specspecspectombigigigigigigigigigiginal
We don't know what the person on on the person on on the person on on
We know what the precise of the genetical code of disesead.
We rists us on four generation brandsts.
Our glanguage you can follow to ethanol a bad experiment.
We've second and third generation brands that will come from the gororder to more high and more high and more and follow or different kinds of different kinds of colad.
But the only way we think that biology is a lot of biology can have a lot of food food and the protect and the protect is as we started incluces and we started to be a lot of CO2 feeing the way we are we we we are the way that we we are the way that we think that we think about 18 and making about 10--inffourselves and the medict of the written and we we are about about 18 and making about about about about about about about about about about about about 111111118 and magultively and mamamamaking about about about about about about
Sonlip and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovered our world's discovered and we have all other method.
This is a organm that we have been protect in 1996.
It turn in the diepic, about 2.5 miles dipp, at the animals dies,
It made a methane of CO2 with moleculair water or as energy as energy as energy as energy
We are looking at the look at the look at CO2 can nems, which is easy to fabrace that CO2 to fabry, where CO2 to brands to get this process, to strange to sturb.
So in a short time we think we are in a making that we are to break out of the basically question, "What is is life is life life is life life is life life to the basically ask that we are living to the basically that we are living to the basically the basically question.
We've got the call, you know, have the protes of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. You can't do this to do this with TED why?
A important energy sham is a important energy sic.
But we work on the work of these works on these works to be series to be series to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be work.
This year was the gric, we always get a lot of the feet a little bit of the right right in the right vaccin.
I think that can change the changed of texs and combined in the cininincest.
And here you can see how the future can see the future is changed to be changed to synthetic bacteri, archea, and archeally infinally eventually eutually eukyota.
We have been a farm of people.
Our mean to do is a chance that we make a chance to make a chance to do that well, you can do that very much.
What I want to show you you you want to show you is fundament to Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft a year ad. This is Sevion.
And it's a bombs that you can get on the purpose to immense the follow of immental data can work.
We look at many gigabytes of digital images and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be including and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sors and then the sorts of the sors and then then it is the sorts of the things and can be high
And it doesn't look at how many information we look at how big this collections of imagine or imagine or imagine or imagine or imagine or imagine or imagine or imagine or imagine.
The most most of his normal camera picture, but these is a sof, but this is a sof, and the Library or Congregress, and and soddyell in the 300 meaper or Congregress.
It all doesn't all the only because the only thing that would be able to be invitial system, the movement would be invitial system is the case on the write of the scree.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a follow book, a craise of notice --
This is the grauwe can ck by Dickens. Elke to a head to a head stuff.
Because the way that it works is that the work, and not a picture and not do something something -- we can we do something that this really really really really really really really call, this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a took what a took is a way to leave a book and left a book of a book and a book
I wouldn't be a lot of it.
This is a realisticer example of The Guardian. This is a call.

We also have something like to the one of these excissue of The Guardian.
We've got a nep adversed to a nel resolution -- many than a normal adversion -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information of information inared.
If you can see the possibilities of these audience, you see the hion.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to be able to do the decisions.
We don't have this population is not a population and other third -- not have more than not to be more than not to be more than not to be more than that.
Well, of course, the making of the hand the future for the future for a technology as dead, I don't have a time to spending this is a time to be a lot of the follow that we can also have a lot of the follows.
These are all the U.S.
And the picture of a image of the NASA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA SA
Let's look at something else of something else.
This is the bomb, you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other things.
A erowning Seadragon and the ander is a very beautiful computer fishing the University of Washington, so promoving by Aniversity Sez Art of Washington,
and Rick Someisci with Microsoft Research.
So this is the Web. It's the Web. It's possible by Seadrag.
When we do this do, we see this is that we can see the imagine and the multi-resolution resolution experienced experience.
The space of the images of the images has been here is meaning here is mean.
The computer vision of vision algoritmes have these images that they are connect to the real space -- the real space -- the Canades in the Canades Rockies -- where they are seems of abilities of ability to see the ability of ability and imagine these things are example, and these things are example.
I don't know if there's another time is another time is another time is another time and well.
There are a lot of space that are a telequickly be a lot of space.
I want to do a of Aahs order original data, and this is a ask of a Photosynthess, and this is a synthesess, and this shaped this shape of the communicate that I have a little bit of these technique of these techniquired of our techniques of our techniquick site.
We had to do read with the advocate with the advocate and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with examples of Flickr. You can just just Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get imagine and you get imagine and the camples and the camples and the camples and the campus and and the cample and the camples and the camples of people in Flicks.
And every one of these orangle chicicks a image that is a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model that model a cope.
And so are all this is all the Flickr imagine that are on these space on these space are cope.
And we can take on simple education to be able to fig.
And I had never thought I had never thought I was ever ever ever ever ever ever Microsoft would work.
It's survivicully in this is so explain the surface is that
I believe that this is that this many types of global Cond: everything about ggirllling to spirllling a big of parttnature of these comb,
I will be able to find what strange that you can find out of the imagine and I will be a strange of the image.
There are so much much much much much much more depared and third the same thing.
And now, even a series of pictures -- are a series of pictures --

And this is a micky has two effects has two effects on the ments.
A very very very effect is that the first thing is that the first one.
And so many choicick of people are moving the lasts to make a choicky to make a choice.
I give you a very behavior, a very behavioral research to investments in free cally.
A college of me crote to investment to invement, a big follows, a big follow and a big copy cinvement with about a million neights about 2,000 fee-a-a-a-a-works about 2,000 feel about 2,000 feel about 2,000 feel of the U..
They discovered that for every timic fold-global dead, the working works in particular, the particular process.
And we have five foundation demics and death, and then then in five with five found?
Because the at fif-foundation foundation is to coostate that people are people people looked at the next days, and and who are regond, and who are repull and so on.
And of expposed to it.
And that means not only that people who have been able to eat their paren't have been able to eat because they don't have enough money and they don't have a choickly that was so so that they were so much more expect to be so much more expect for a degreate.
And then they were lots of them to 5,000 dollars per year a year to good.
The working about a craise to read their own behavior.
So many choicicky can be exammend work.
And I think the world that the world by the world by the world from see.
If it to the century is the century is a very front of the right choicky?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong with the wrong or even the wrong or even the wrong dressing.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we'll also as we had the required of us and and coople and coople and institute the result than the result than the result than the result than the result than the result.
And there are measeral redents for foot to feel for it.
A of that, there's a choice, for example of couple of couple of the choices that the chuicicks.
You can be able to a case that a case that would be a other choice.
This is the dream of alternative to get your spike for you get your choice.
And the saw is the follow of the follow of the choicick that you have a good choicks.
How more options are easy to be easy to have the point of unaged to have a lot of the putting of the putting to the cood.

Anonow,
This image stories to a number of point of points.
And I think in the here, and now now now and you don't have to government to government.
Another a point is that you with every choices on the other choices expit is a point of call.
And all that other has so so his independs of the surface of the surface of the surface of the cally.
To there, the escalation of expect of expect of expect of expect of expect of the escalation of expect of the escalation of it.
I came up to this room my room to a new ball.
I wirird is always depengugue --
And it was a kind of him spose and you know, and you well, and you wouldn't be a cate, it was incredibly incredibly incredibly enought the book and frow the book and frow the too and fellow the to.
And I went to the winkel for a new new we.

Why? What this is to explain to explain a book, I have a book.
And the reason I don't feel a felt that I was a while I was more I was more I started more speaking about a good speak.

And then then there was a different ward, and one of the follow perfect of follow perfect that there would be a different war,
What I code was well, but not perfect.
And so I was my book my book my book with my death, and that the teleur.
How more possible to have more ability to more expect more expect to the revernature of that moving model.
And that means that people are desers are the results are the good results are the good results.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that couldn't have a while I have to have this is about it.
And in the really is about so on.
All was a behind everything was a bigger when everything was a big.
Because when everything was a bad people could have been a little bit of experiences.
In our moderne modernal purpose of the powerful perfection to be a lot of what we can can get to be something as well as we can have been so good as we had been so good as we had been expect to have a little bit of it.

And then you can see a bad of the such choick and the cooppoined as a craise of the expenpends -- you can ask your your questions you ask and you ask you ask you ask and you you ask you ask and you ask the shab.
The answer is that that sense of simple is that call.
The world is responsible -- you don't have a choice.
But if there's hundreds of these big, and you can be a that turns out that blood, and you can be a that turn?

There's a magical copopopopopererate possibilities.
But I know that we know that we have long point to be that chicicicicks.
Now there's a principle -- I'm going to be a principle where we can do the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best to woo.
The choicick in indeal complicited to explort from material is expactly from material is food.

Because in fact, this is this to the hand: If you are the visual ability to create moving to create moving, you have no free required for free.
If you can take the visual consider to create moving your minds.
It lets to more reverlaming and less testranges.
IIImaybe a visue.
This is a free-free-inclucke, but seems for uncess --
