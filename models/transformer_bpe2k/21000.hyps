Last year I showed these two slides to show that the Poice, who had the past three million years of the U.S, with 40 percent of the U.S, with 40 percent of the U.S, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the nerries of this specific problem because it doesn't make the decades of the ice of ice of the ice of the ice of thing that is actually showing the disguage.
The ice skapple on the North Pole, in a way, in a way, in a way, from our global climate system.
It turns out in the summer.
The next slide I shows is a faster version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is diversation in red.
Like you see, it is out of darkly blue.
That's the annual ice ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent ic, five years or older, five years or older, is almost like blood that from the body.
In 25 years is the from this is going to this up.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen was ground around the North IJszea, and there are a very large amount of frozen womer frozen womer -- when the death of microbes -- when the deat.
Consider to the total amount of diverse in the atmosphere that could be dismanty, that could be double as we concept the point of the point of the point of atmosphere to deal the ath,
In some indepth of indepth in Alaska board of all of the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another one-involved to another undeep there.
Why! She's OK. The question is echer or we will be that will be well.
A reason for that, this is that this huge warm-bron" Greenland from the north warms.
This is a meldar.
The water volume is the water-volume greater than equal equal is more than echer eat.
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea squire because the landips, it's the place where it is the place where it is in the sea way.
These are flow are going to flight
At the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
For rapid month reported scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance has been negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly soon the meltiland-single underwaters.
The whole continent to six feet sea meter seespear stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after the largest ice mass, there are new mass, who were still gletsjs.
40 percent of the global population is the half of his drinkwater of that meltable.
In the Anths, is this glestyer the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are now more strows.
But when they disappearing the drinkes of the drink-water.
In California was a further of 40 percent in the snowwl of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires in the water reservoys.
And as you could read the predictions are such as you could re.
This global dreamed dreamed to a dramatic stying,
And the number of nature, and the number of nature, and never speeched an awful and never seen seet.
Four times more in the last 30 years, then in the past 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping is completely unkeeping
If you look at the both of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 every 24 hours every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Kook at the Eastern area of the Stille Ocean, from America, a's Side from the Indian entered from the Indian subcontinent, there is a behaviors in the oceans.
The only big causes of warming the Earth, the next next to deforestation, which is the source of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fuel of fuel of fossil fuel of fuel of the global fuel of warming warming, is the only big causes of the Earth, is the single big cause, the only big original fuel of the Earth, which is the only big
Olie is a problem, and steenkool is the most largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincludes, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban carbon centrales.
But we see a circle of the circle of all.
These are the coal-carbon which the bomb, the bulling of the past years and where green alternatives were prepared forces.
There is a political freezed to the move of the craft in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industiry gave 250 million dollars to promote "scaled support to promote what is a concept of concept to the conversation.
And that picture was doing something that was thinking about something like this.
And the guy was in Tennessee, in Tennessee, about four billion litererally citizens model.
You probably seen the news.
This is the one after the largest dishe-to-single in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking around the Kerstonkoolined was these.
Video: "Frosty the steencarbon many, is a stage, employment challenged guy.
He's overfluence, he has been here in America, and he causes that our economy.
Frosty the urban is screen with the day of the day
He's paid and estimate and employees and working."
Here is a big part of the voice coin West Virginia in West Virginia.
The largest most of the country is the great beeber of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear to be clear Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they talk about about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, has two campaigns on the too.
This is a piece of it.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern shone of these hypermodern crobbs carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines are making a little bit of a little bit of low.
But that's the sound of shootools.

If you want to go far far far and colly."
We need to go far far and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with a update about how this machine works.
So I am here -- I am not warenes: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever scientific experiment, 27 miles in bomb
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked less than a billions of second after the universe was started after the universe started to 600 million times a second after the universe to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitious, thus!
This is the machine Genekey;
We took photographs of that mini-Bangs inside detectors in detectors -- it's called ATLAS detector -- 44 meter breed, 22 meter in diameters.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in addition so you can see the scale.
At 10 years we put the machine for the first time, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
And that worried for a partment in the controlling room.
It's a photograph of the first particle straight, which was going around the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, valvalue by the detector in the detector floor.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine words, what a huge over.
I don't know if this the largest across the largest device, or thing, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of say.
That means we made a cultural as a scientific cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
And those behaviors ago 13 thousand clearly calls when the machine work.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's not true. It's too small behavior."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that are able display that flow strough.
In one of the connections between the negas thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructivated.
It was the wire was something warmer, and it was intended to be electrical resistance against that 13 thousand of call.
This was the result.
This is even more impression, if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 ton away, and they were about 30 inches were moving about 30 inches.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We all have them when they all divices them all the time.
Now they are back to the way.
Eind map the LHC will be againtact.
We will put it back and we expect measures in juni, or right so we can go further and expect what the building stone of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, have the debate of the debate re-re-involved research of scientific research of scientific requence.
I think the fact that it's so difficult that we go further than the LHC.
I let the last words to the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to deal with the values of the values of his teacher was Michael Farael Faraday, this is so dangerous, this is so dangerous for progress of human mind than to take the human mind that our images of human mind that we don't have any new mystery that we don't have a messapull that we have no new mysterions in the nature, and that we have no new new forward to discdiscushead to discushead that we we we we we we we we we are that there are that there are that there are not have no new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to asking you back to your childhood to your childhood time you play.
When you discover how to grab it to grab them up, and they were awed and consciously to the consciously relationship with and hands of space relations.
Rumtely insight is destrong is destront of the world to understand it.
If an information is inspired by the physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- with my advisur Pattion and my compassion and my compassion and my compassion -- I started to ask me -- what if we would use a computer of the enduring of the enduring of the enduring of an environmental vinger that we could do with with the hands of individual character what we could do with the information with the grapith information of information would have to do with with the things in the both of information with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other thing ell information of
and can ordering as we want to do that?
And these question him so that we decided to go to visit and seek by building the Siftables.
Sifton is a Siftable interactive computer of an interactive computer size of a cow-cooky.
They can be movement with the hand they can feel together their movement crowed and they were a screen and they free a screen and wireless contact.
The point is the physical treatmental treatment, just as blocks can they get to grab them by grapits.
And the vendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that this helped resources have a more physical different, are aware of their movement and even of the way that we move them are different new and fun interactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instated to tell a video that they have been able to tell a video and others and otherset others and otherset of call.
These interactive portraits of interactive portraits of conscious.
And as the next next to each other, they will interest to each other.
If they become the concept, they can also this and what can be nervous this and what nervous way.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all, the use of all, as it exactly a bunch of color as it was a liquid of a color as it was a liquid loud.
In this example three Sifttables lesson for and can use them to go color in a very much, where they become color in a good.
If we have over, we went back to the little bit back.
There are some of the case possibilities for the education, especially played play with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people to the potential to see the result immediately immediately immediately immediately immediate immediately ely exist.
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple acci of a simple computation programmate.
Here we show a game that a crow-cross-between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the running letter on every Siftable, and then found words are controlled in a dictionary words are controlled in a dictionary.
After 30 seconds is the very rescue, and apply a new series of letters with the behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the way. And I did it and make a video of it.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions to have instructions of instructions of the most interesting things that are need.
Everything you have to say is "Pole, and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the time.
That's our young best bengineer.
And as it looks at the Siftleles.
For him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painted paint.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrates it.
He can bring new carakters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that carpackarter's table.
Here he shows the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good gon! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftletables and the next next to each other, and the next next to each other, and the carakters with each other, Way!
DM: and so his own stories.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end up with an open end in the end of an open end.
and he decided how it goes away it looks like this.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show that I will show you today Is a synthesial and live music instrument that we developed the lead, where every Siftle's lead, bass and pressm.
Eend, one of course, four different variation, where you can choose what you want to use the same thing.
These sounds can be injected in Siftles, so you can be determined to determined the pattern.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the tile of a very sound of a lot of disable, as a reverb and filter.
They have been dedicated and provide by by the chance.
And the most general effects like tempo and volume that are are applied on the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: Did we start with a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I put the basline.
Video: Desis now I add some some beat.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the print, so I can affect live can affect live can influence.
Video: Dutilian can be very quickly, by the offices of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Now I buy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rescre-reached as it plays play.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything and making the very longer and shorter as I want.
In the dimmal of the dimses of the volume Siftable to count Siftable to count the left.
Thank you.
Like you can see, my passion from the passion of new people, from the new human-computer interfaces that our brain and both of the brains and work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we developed in the lab.
The thought I would like to bring is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interacting with digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at the point of you to all of you.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long life for a long life, and I don't think that that will change ever change that will change ever change that will change.
And yet there is something that happened to be something in my life and career and career and career and re-re-involved with my work on and re-involved in my work
It started with a book I had been writing unnerrowd a memoire: "Et, Beminner -- that very very in conceptive to my first work and an international exist.
The sequence is that people now have to be done to me as if I did I do job as if I did job
And the thing -- I mean, say!
People come to me and questions to me and ask you that you can't equal this succes?
Don't you get your entire life will be able to write your entire life will be able to publish in the fact where people will write for warm.
Do you don't afraid there?"
Erg dissed, you know.
Of course, that would be very much, I remember that I remember over 20 years ago, I was a teenage -- I was a teenage -- I was a teenage -- I was going to become a degree to become a teenage -- I was a teenage -- I was a teenager,
People said, "Do you don't get that you will never be success?
Do you don't afraid to education, that you will go through this by by the way,
Do you don't afraid you will be able to work without that there is something that there ever something that you will be something that you will be able to deal with your bitter-bit-in bitters, with your mouth as of falen?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short comes to this questions on this is "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough.
Also, all of the time already
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid you don't know where for everything for all.
For sea weweer things like this, and other one of things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that comes from, the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is the logical that somebody is front for working for the work for where they are to their mention?
What is so particular about creative processes that we make make us to make the effects of the mindnesses of the mindness, something that is going to be able to otherwise the other thing is going to do is not going to do anything in other.
Take my father. He was scemisted engineer, and I can't remember that there was a 40 years he worked on him that he was working on him or he was not afraid for that he was afraid for that was afraid for it.
That's how to you say, "Yohn, how do it with your chemistry?
No, so it was not about it.
To be fair to be: scemistrate engineers have been seeing the centuries of not the reputation of manically, for a piece of manically, depressive alcoholists.
Privers well, who have such kind of reputation.
Not just writers, other creatures, even more than creative people have been pretty instable.
And look at the grimming death the most magnifed of the 20th century.
Many died young as often by own devices of it.
And even the ones who didn't seem to be suicide to be under their gave to be concerned to be suic.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of my books is a book of my books is a death of my books
That's a little bit of a lot to say about your life.
But of this kind of excited, we don't look at it.
We all have heard it all before, and have heard it with my all accepted.
The head is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is that a poor, and that a artist-eventually invented to read to the cellent.
So I want to ask everybody here today to ask that idea is that idea of life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I think I think about it, I think about it, I don't think it's a pretty good thought.
I think the resistance.
And also even more dangerous.
I don't like to see this century, this century,
We can create a lot better better than to live much better to live in to live in it.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark in my thought of thought that dark in my mind.
In fact, the fase where my career is in which my career is now in which my career is now
Go only after that, I am still young year ar ar ar years.
I might be able to work on the decades.
And so, probably the incentives will be now with the outside world as the outside world as the work that followed on that outside of the work that extraordinary book.
And we're here with friends under each other, so I can you get it to you: highest my greatest success.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is your for you you know the morning, you know, it's a hours to the depend of the depend of the deat.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be working with the work I love with the work I love with the work I love to work that I love the work I love to work that I love to work that I love the work I love to work that I love.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I am thinking about the conclusion that I can only go through with writing a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of the process of the process of the conclusion that I can only do a p
I have to write the writing of a security between mind me between mind, and my concept and my conversation in my future publicly to the reactions,
I had been looking for the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in history, and I do in history, and have me in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help create creative people to help create with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search was built me to the old Greeks and Romens.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romen's old Greeks and believed people didn't create that creativity was from themselves.
And they believed that creativity was a goddal mind, who was from a destate place to the ment, to human beings and unknown reason for reasonable reasonable reasonable reason reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reason for reasonable reasonable to be dedicated in a departly, unknown for dealing to the human mine and un
The Greeks called these Greeks called this crazy of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon who had a demon who was influist.
The Roments had a species of idea.
In them is a genident of creating creative minds.
The funny is that the Roman with a genius with a genius with a particular piently person diverse.
In their policy was a kind of magical goddal entities that were going to be in the walls of the ateler of the ateler of the poor.
A little bit like Dobby the huge of the house
If the artistic is working on the work was the genius assistance.
And he was the shape of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first thing about the results of your work.
Everybody knew how to work in his work work.
The artists was so in protection to the most example, for example,
If you were brilliant work, you don't get all the eer.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius had helped inside of the crazy.
Where's crowd, then you know, it's not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty undependent genia.
Last time is that we had been described how in the West creativity was described
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed in the Renaissance, and everything changed
There was a whole new idea: the individual ments is the individual ments is the resource of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attention from the godnment,
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual form.
And for the first time in history, there was a little bit of artists that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genie.
I have to say that I think I have to find that a big from.
And to let one person, one one individual individual that he or she or she or she is the essentially mystery, the essentially mystery, of everything that creative and the known force of everything -- that's something that is something -- that's something too much for a city for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swallowed to set
Egos are read to smile, and then reverse are regular expectable to prestate expectations to prestate expectations to be coperation.
And I think this pressed the last 500 years of artists has made a lot of artists made a lot of artists.
If that's so -- I think is the question is, "What do is the question now?"
Can we do this different things?
Can we go back to a old understanding of the relationship between the ments and create mysterious mysterious mysteri?
Maybe not.
We can running 500 years, we can rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes
Probably in the audience people who are took scientific doubt about the idea that elfell requires with what fact, in fact, with some fact, and what the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspirating the idea that elsed.
It doesn't seem to me that I'm going to get you in the way.
And yet, I ask it out.
Why not?
Why would we do that thought we don't have to do that thought of the thought of the thought.
It fastly as much as much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally include uncalcular process.
Everybody who has trying to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so all of the attacks, and here -- that creative process doesn't always rational ace.
And that sometimes the paranorally is a paranorally apply.
I have been away the great American closer Ruth Stone was going to be Ruth Stone of the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the
She is thick in the nine. Her entig. Her entirely desire.
She told me about her childhood on the Virginia.
Some of the work, if she was felt on the work was felt to the work on the country.
It was so said, she was so though there was a big wave air came air from roll.
And so so that golf than the country to do the country to her country to her it.
She felt that the ground of her feet had started to scue her at that moment but one thing to do is to do --
She ran back home, reaching by the purch, and they had to do as quickly and then paper and paper to pick up and paper
When the poem was close by her hunt waves her only was her only to write it on the waves of the waves.
Sometimes she was not very quickly enough.
Then soil, but calculator.
At such a moments the poem by her himself by by her -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in
And then there were some of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- they were the close to almost of the story -- they were going to be poet.
And then she was looking for the paper and paper and paper and paper the purching of her him.
Jug at that time, she had a potle-to pak.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she plured the poem of the air.
She was purching the close to his body, and then it back in her body, as she wrote the same thing in her body,
And in those cases came up with the poem of what in the paper in the paper, but then in the paper of the paper followed followed followed by the paper of the paper of the paper of the paper of the paper of the paper of those cases came up with paper of the purer, but then in those cases in that ca
And then I think -- I thought I was -- what is so affect my creative process ey!
That's what my creatures my creative process isn't medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouse of a mouse, who is on the same time, and then sweat, and then sweat, and transformed by blood and transform.
But even in that day; I had a little bit of a experience of a experience.
You will also know it myself as well, that feeling that creative ideas in your regular that you can identify impossible to identify impossible to identify impossible to identify as you can identify impossible.
What is that then is that for fun to source
How can we use it without that we get it without that we get it without work?
Another that good for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician's musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a few years ago.
We had this about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life was showing the shows of the geancient that is trying to get to get to get to get in the impulse of the power to get involved in him.
With the years was Tom some more more than a little bit more more ror.
And one day he reached in Los Angeles on the fast rom, and changed the process of radical display --
As he heard so he heard a clip, he heard a clike.
The decided to him, like inspiration that is degrap, untouch, crop, ccrazy.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashim it.
But it didn't go to that.
He had no paper -- no paper at the tancy of a tance;
The well-known exciting back again, "I got the took of the melody of the melodd of the century behind me century.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't get that whole mental process and he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked up to the air, and he looked up to the air, you can't see that I behind the govern?"
"Do you really think I can write a song,
If you really want to get this song, you have to get later even though you have to do that, if I have time for you.
So not, not, then somebody else fall.
Go neighborh." And from that moment when the moment that moment when I lose the process of the process of the process of the process of course.
The work is the same thing to do with the known dge, with the except of the exactly knowledge of the exactly known dge,
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him oprible that was distant as distance of genia.
The genius was going to close to close and the living only and lived only ope.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go through it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the propertile aspect that not completely of Tom itself was that not completely of Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of works.
I had been doing it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Beminning process of Ets, Beminners.
And at a point moment I move in desperation.
You know that you don't want to be working, but you don't want to be a terrible disaster disaster is the book book ook a horrible book ook it.
Not solid bad and really really bad bad bad and bad bad
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that are who who are wished and I also decided to way.
I wisd I wished from my manuscrip, and I focus criped to a very single of the room.
And I said, "Look, then, we know all of that if this book is not just brilliant is not just by me.
You can see that I have to get everything in what I have in my face.
More I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better than you have to get your thing to get your thing to do is to get your thing to do.
Do you don't do that, thank you you thank thank you.
I just writing because that's one of my work.
Oh, and in the notils are being solid that is just a lot of apart to be appeared on off."
Tja--- Utough it comes up here on this --
Eeuwen ago came in the North African desert people to thanlight in month, to thank maybe the music.
Uren and hours and hours to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes happened to be something extraordinary happened.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you have seen with that, you ever see something like this, you ever see in a performer.
It was like the time was the time and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights are now in the fact of all.
And then suddenly he didn't only longer just a human beings just a human beings
In him, under him of bridge it.
A goddly furally across him.
If something called the studied thing happened to people what it was Dan they started clap and roping them and roeping the roepen: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was it for them.
And by the way, a fun historical fact, when the Moren Sououth South South Spanin, they brought this one with them.
The spoke is the echer by the century of the centuries of "Allah." Allah." Allah."
That you've got to focus today in fights and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spanin Spanin is something impossible or magical purch, oil, oil, oli, oil, oli, oli, oil, oli, great,
Anounderstanding of God.
Precions we need to have what we need.
Lasty is the dance of thanks the next morning to the next morning at the momanday to be 11 hours in the morning to be a godd-focus layer.
At that moment he is a little elder guy with debad with debt that will never get more to be able to get more to such a little bit of the well.
Maybe there will never somebody God will never attackaged dances.
What does it now does it still have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really difficult to selling a creative mind.
But so painful it.
And imagine that you don't want to get the most unusual aspects of your person from yourself from yourself.
And if you believe that you believe that you have a while, you know, a while,
When you are ready with it, they are given to somebody else.
That's how to consit, everything.
I can do intent of the day.
The last months, I worked on a book that will ship into a book that will different. The book where a lot too long as much as a long time to be excited.
The opolger of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me go on the hall, I keep the same one: Don't get away up. Pre.
Then just you get your work.
So just you get thing, what it is.
If you are too to, thank you to thank you.
If the goddal genius is apply decided to make in your work at some moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful sourc!"
People doesn't thank thank then, thank you all agree.
And also then, "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that of hard.
"Oling!" "How do these, because we are pure human love and propertly, we continue from pursue and propertile of the engineering and propertly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olet me do that!
You know, I had this projects about some of these projects, about some of human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what it can mean, and what that can mean,
We actually started from a new point, we were the biology to the biology to the digitize, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new fase in the biology and synthetism of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think have been trying to understand how many biologists have tried to understand in different levels have trying to understand in different levels have trying to understand the different levels.
We tried different approaches and tried to bring the back to minimal components.
We are now almost 20 years, almost 20 years.
When we have the human genome of human genome called the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life -- can we live in life or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome of a kind of that can be a kind of that can conmultiply in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at if we can get a name of a little tiner.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at metabolical ma, is that relatively display away with the unnership,
Gelore me, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the genes that we can switch a piece of living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell that would be able to look at a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cel
And we decided to do that the only route of the only route this chromosome of this chromosome of the most fundamental questions, so we could deal with the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started to do a chromosome synthet?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome of "restard?
A chromosome is but a piece of chemical inates material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accelerate to exponential forestablished to exponential forest.
Our power to write the genetic code rather slose of a long slowly slowly slowly slowly access.
And our last point of the last point of the last point on an exponential curve.
We started here over 15 years ago,
There were some of a number of stage for a bio-ethical ethical ethical access of the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA will be able to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more mistake.
So we had to make a new method for the condition of these little pieces and corrigate of all the follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria deate.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part started when we put a piece of chemical chemical stant chemical stant chemical code the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic particles are going to make the genetic particles are making the genetic particles were making the genetic code of the bacteria started to reades
The vial particles were when they got out of the cells, they came back and they came back and death the E. coli.
I was under that I was going to speak with the oil industry, and I said they would be able to well.
They laught more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much larger.
We wanted to build the ential bacterial chromosom.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassetttes, so we could be able to build the cassettes in cassettes --
to understand what the deeply components of a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell to be a living cells to understand what the reality.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than to do it.
When we first first first this is this genome for the first time, in 1995, the standard precision one both of a 10,000 baseparate partners.
And then then we found after resequencing 30 folds. If we had the original sequence, it was not in the fact of starting to start.
And the part of the design of pieces of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be absolutely with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-unities that we have to design together so that we have to design together so that we have to make together.
We design here unique parts in the fact of these are in fact,
Maybe you have been able to put water market in the water-marks.
Bet, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, G, G, G, and T.
Trios of those letters cos for ruwying 20 aminozurs -- that there is a bunch of the aminoxygen for each aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thought.
We just think that we were just to be able to me.
Some of them were dealed that there were no poems.
We have so designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repair and put together.
And we started to start making pieces of the pieces of these were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters were able to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, from 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stage diut, we could move this stuff so we could sequences them because we could create a process because we create a process -- you will will be very robust -- you will see the strareet.
We try to get the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
So as we get to come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow so easily more in E.
And that is the expand of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
That's why we went to reach with other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that can do a mechanism that is used by recombination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair of the biology can feel together.
Here is an example of it.
There is a organism called Deinococcus radio durans that three million rads of radiation that three million radiation.
And you see that you see in the top panel, shem sophic is just just from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he saved it back into each other, in the other, exactly as it was first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacuum
I know absolutely sure that there can be absolutely to be move to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of it,
Here's a deeper-realm microph of the molecule that we made with this processes -- in fact, with this processes -- in fact, with just the right design of the pieces that we did them.
And that's what it is that they admit automatically contempt.
This is not electron-microscopphotograph. This is a ordinary microscope.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes are taken from six seconds.
This is the publication that we were exploring includes out.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule is more than 300 million.
If we would press the 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages to pressing the genetic code of genetic code from the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 10-point letter,
Well, how do we start, how do we started to go to the chromosphere?
And it's a virus is the obviously easily.
And a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like us, as we just knew the cell cell and do another in and doing another in, and that's what you know if you know it close to it.
And in the bacterial species is the chromosome of integrated in the cell, but we have dealthy to show that we can actually have a complete transpllantation of a chromosome of a cell transplant to another one.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbs species.
These are about so far from each other, as people and mouse and mouse much.
We added some extra little extra to this chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of extra --
We have the defined with anzymes to make all the eggs of the eggs of the eggs.
It was free sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell cell.
And we even thought he would come to solid to solid the process of what we were going to develop the process of what we thought to develop the process of what we thought was going to move.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discover all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of chromosome of that they have thousands of properties in one time that they add a performance of properties in one time to the species.
People who evolution is proposed to be a lot of biology has not been a lot of biology
There are enzymes that restriction enought enzymes are called DNA is called DNA
The chromosome that was not easy in the cell was not eat.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- what is in the way.
It was expressed expressed and the other chromosome as a strange material, and we finally had the cell of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromospherital --
He was blue because the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characteristics of one species, and changed that we had been completely in the new software that we in the new software that we in the cell cell we had stop.
All eggs, the membranes changed -- when we changed the genetic code was changed the genetic code where it was changed.
This is a power as a genomic alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamental DNA, to change things fundamental
Good before, I pay that this is not a creation -- this is preparing -- this is pretore for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we might be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make big new species of scale where there are make large new species on this digital design in this digital design in this digital design in this digital design design and based on this digital design is to this digital design is to a new new kind of require,
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear as you look at what you needed if you look at what is needing.
We're going to go into six-a-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context of 1946.
There are now three people on this planet,
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 40 years, that there will be four four of it.
We have to have a lot of food with food of clean water, medicine, medicine, medicine, for the six-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that for notic.
We use five billion ton colles, more than 30 billion ves.
That's 100 miloons of fattle.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than to replace that is going to be a huge challenge challenge of challenge challenge of the challenge of the things are going to be a huge challenge of the process of challenge of the process of the way we can do that a huge challenge of biological process in the enduring process of the process of biological process than also become a huge challenge of biological process than to replace that we also get to replace that is going to replace that is going to replace to replace
Then there is all those carbon dioxide of the front of the state feet.
And by all of our global discoveries we have now now now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dead different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that is going to come out of the diversity that was going to be there.
We are precisely pered by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques thanks to these, they have a lot of combination genomics to do so called combination genomics
We now have the potential to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day of a day.
If you think about the transformation of 20 million different genes or trying to optimalizing processes to create octaneously produced to produce or medicine, we can change with a small team we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life-frequire, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a scremain imagination of what real design software where we work, so you can actually go on the computer and a new kind of on the computer of computer can design and a new kind of on the computer of computer
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We now focus on four generation generation of fuel
Our high-seen face to ethanol of the engineering experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel that will come out from sugar, to more more high and more more high and more more high-grade shapes like occasional species like this.
But the only way we think that biology can have this big influence can have a food price higher and the available and the available is when we start with CO2 as his food provide and so we can see cells the first of doing the way that we do the first field generation of the way, and we think we have the first fourth generation in about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries are all sorts of other methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, with cost temperature of temperature --
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen or as energy hydrogen or as energy source of energy sources
We can look at the whether we can take CO2 and what are easily through pipes that can be able to factory that that CO2 to be reversed to fuel to burn this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we're able to be able to break out of the basal question: What's life?"
We have realize, you know, you know -- have the dedicated profoundly dedicated the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where you can do, where you can do this?
A important energy source is going to be a important energy.
But we also work now now using these tools to think about quickly serions to think about quickly servaccines of these tool.
This year there was the flu, we always just just just just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by by the temptation of disguage.
Here you can see how the future can see that the evolution bom is now the evolution tree is changing evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are more away from people.
Our goal is survive that we make a chance to survive for long, for a long enough to survive that might be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a little bit of a new technology that we get to a new technology that we get to the Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seehavior.
And it's a environment where you can get local or at distance with immense amount of visual data can work in the way.
We look at the time, here is many gigabytes to digital images and can continue to sit up and except the sors and the sors to our wish to our wish to our wish to our wish to our wish to our wish to our wish and the sorts of sorts of the order to our wish and the sorts of the gigabytes and
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images.
Most of them are normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of the Librile of the Librel of the 300 members.
It makes nothing because it was only about the prestatisions, and the amount of pixels on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the grade of the graduate house is a column.
To prove that it is really text, and not imagination, and we can do something to do is something to show that this really text issue, to show that this is not imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't admit to me.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Each big image is the beginning of a substance of a bottom.
This is really a really gives you the pleasure of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We have made a nep advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you can see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can actually make sure that we can actually make the limitations of treating by the screen of treating through the screen.
We hope this is not popp-ups more population and other third flawwwo -- not need more more than to be more more than to be more more than to be more more than to be more more than to be more more population.
Of course, are a maps of course, is a lot of apply apply for a technology like this, I'll talk to here, I will not spend a lot of time to talk about this field that we can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of a lot of the maps of the maps are able to be a lot of a lot of the supply of the enty of course of the technology as we can also be able to do this much more more than to be a lot of technology like this, I will spent to talk to the other other other
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else now.
This is now now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoter to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz on University on University on University of University on University of University of Washington, and the University of Washington, and the University of Washington, and the University of the U
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you can see that we can see that we pull the images and experience the multi-resolution.
The space shake of the images has this meant has this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have been building these images are building together with the real space -- the Grassi in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diashowling these things are spaced space tos and all these things are space in the crot.
I don't know if there is another time, there is another environments to show you
There are a lot of space that are more space.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we work summer, which is the summer -- to the communicate of this environments -- to the engineering power is the realm of this techniques on our website.
We had to keep account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for the images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and campus and campus and the campus and the campus and the cirts, and you get images from the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And each of these orange chgely gives a image that are part of this model of this model --
And so these are all Flickr imaginative imaginations, which are supposed to be copied copied in this way,
And we can be able to night night.
You know, I never thought I would never work to work at Microsoft would work with Microsoft.
It's overwhell here is so defined to be so unclear.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are cameras are all of the glud: everything from the globe, a big number of it, together in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images
There are so much working by faces and so much of faces and so on.
Eruns somewhere between this -- this is even a series of photographs -- are these one.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churness by the program.
If we have four through the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can actually do things with the social environment, this is now the data of everybody -- from the whole whole collective memory of the entive securs looks like this, the Earth -- and heading it everything to each other.
All these photographs are contemporary and forms together a very little bigger than the sharing of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth's entire Earth.
So this is a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the work of the work of the ard.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it as they use the provide of the people who use it.
Their own photographs are pressed from metape data that somebody else inved.
If somebody would want to climb and would like to climb and their names and their names of the Notre Dame is require that data, and I can use as a access to the space, that metape that metape that metape is using every photographs and create with this kind of cru-modale, and created social experience.
And of course, is the be-product of this imments rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only only from air photographs, satelite images and other applies and other applies is dedicated from the collectively several memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what you make your software possible on a day, in the next years, all of the images that are dealed by everybody in the next years,
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered is discovered.
It creates to your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the imaginations.
And that's defined exciting when you think about the richchchealization that are available information that many of these imagines.
When you go to imagine in the web of image, you feel a shape, and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagination of what the imagination is what the imagination.
What if now if you can see that imagination is to all your imaginations?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes out of that, in the massive of that comes out of the massic networking.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.
One of the intense pleasure of eth-eat-eventually, is the possibility to live between those who are the old living to live in the wind, who are not forget to the old living in the wind, the prod, the profished of the profit in by the raise plantenance to produce the profishing blurt launched in the profishing launched in the provide of the intense of the intense of the intense of the intententense of the intense of the intense of the intense of the intense of the old of the old thing to lif.

the consequence of a apply set apply choices that create our propulse of generations that create our propulse of the entirely of the fun of the engineering choices that we have generations.
Of course, we all share the same apply destroy: World Breng children in the world. Breng children in the world.
We all make insiling inform rites
Againing the including dishehes by the death.
So it can't be surprising that we all of them, thank and these, thank and art art.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song, and the ritm of the dance of dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodoma's Candero in Haitial Ars in the Kaisut in North Kenya, the Candya, the Candya, the Candando in the Andes-basically Ara in the heart of Sahara. This is the man with the desert of desert -- or a mayre-aver-requird -- or a re-awle of the helling of the hells of the woman of the Bomago -- or nomazing of the wood is is is is in in in in in in in in the Bither on in in the BBBBBBrowest in the heart in the Sundressell-old-olden Coman an air of the

They all learn us all that we can think of otherwise we can think of other, we can think of them in the earth of orient.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea of you can just give this idea hope.
Samen forms the intelliliberal cultures in the world is a Web of spiritual and culturally the planet and for her just as important as the biological life is as important as the biological life web: the biospiritual life.
This cultural life creatures you can imagine as you can imagine as a dinner of eat.
The nos; the extent of the foot of all the thought, if the totally of all thoughts, myths, myths, and inspirations and inspirations and inspirations that are explored by human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The foot is the big nalaturation of humanity.
They are the symbols of all of that we can be and all of that we can be as amazing newsing newshape.
It's not like the biosphere is the big, is the enos; it's enos; and even in much larger mate.
No biologist, would be working that the help of all species of all species on the point of the species of extinction, because that's simply not where is.
And that, the most apocalyptic scenario scenario of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is the loss.
And when everybody here was born there, there were sixousand of languages.
A language, is more than her words, or her grammatical rules
A language is a dedical of human vision.
It's the vehicle that is the sick of every unique culture the material world reached the material world to get the material world to get the material world of every unique culture the material world that are reached the material world of every unique culture the material world that are reached the material world that the material world that are proaching.
Every language is a century old old old old -- a shift, a mind, a thought, a thought, a thought, a ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And from that six-thousand of talks today is the day of not more in child in child ors of fluist.
They are not longer touched babies longer
Effective means that unless a change, that they are dead.
Is there something like this, then then get aid by the past of your people, the last of your people, not to spend your language, no chance to spend the wisdom of the ancestors of the kids or the reward of the kids have to see the promise of the kids have to see the temptation of the kids of the kids of children are going to see the wisdom of the children to see the promise
Preires that term is somebody's devices every two weeks somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks of the old letter and with him the last letter of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, don't have a better place to be better place to be better if we all all the same language of the same language of Super, let's take Yoruba -- let's we have Yoruba -- well, let's take Yoruba

In fact, they were the air, they photographs of itself with our ideas, where they remove to our ideas, where they had never seen a second dimensional image had never seen a second dimensional image image had never seen a second dimensional imagined by the second-dimensional bload of the air.
They were photographs and tried to find the face behind the face behind the face.
When they didn't have anything to found anything they were the thuel of this with this is that after the criots of them with spire spire is wrong.
But the Waorani were not just outside of the stockaying, but also each other.
First of their death crossed from the deaths of their deaths from the body.

If you start to start to be able to create these cultures can be scaled to start to get your understanding for some of their extraordinary exploring this plant.
It's a picture I april in the North Amazone Amazone called Amazone called called Amazone took
This is ayahouse asca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahouse is so fascinate, is not just the farmacological potential of it, but how focus from two sources of two sources of two sources.
And sile there is a keep carbon that took carbon and harmaline and harmaline in and heart hallucinating.
If you take the plant to look at the plant looks like a blue requalm by your consciousness of your consciousness.
The plant is being mixed with bad of a coffee becomes like Psychotria vial ridis.
The plant squarkly tryptamines, narrow because of braserotonine, dimethyptamine, 5-methoxyptamine, 5-methoxyptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they snuired that substance of different species that methoxydimethyptami ltryptamine contains in the way,
That poem your blazs, is as from a past forest, protected by the barokad, to countries to countries to countries in a sea of electricity. This is not a reform of reality, it creates within reality, it creates from reality of reality of reality of reality
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince my professor, who did the psycheal adedling with his discovered by his discovered by his discovered in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I pay that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect are intrying, because when the effect involved home, no more home, because they are not oral in oral hallucination because they were from their effect in the human done by a singym in the human dinner enzyme in the human domin: monoxidase.
They can only be ingenomed with something that the monoamine of soamine of shape.
The fascinating is that the table, the table, in the lian legorous monoamine-suppressed monoamine-ptamine ptamine itself, how can do this in a flora of 80,000 plants in a florder of 80,000 plants two morphy pullabored species that are combined a bioamine-more, more more ential forming than the shape of the shape of the shape of that are larger, then the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the square that is that is that is that is that is of the shape of 80000-sum of the single of the

The Indians say, "The Indians, talks to talk to uns.' What does that mean? This stem the Cofan, knowing 17 various of ayahhomels can identify all of the big distance that they could be able to be a kind of single as one species would be able to be one kind of a kind of species.
If you put their question in map their txonomy in map, they say, "I thought you know something of plants to the plants of plants.
You know that is you all now." I said, "No."
And you can see all the 17 species in a night species in a night in a lot of different toones of sings.
You don't promovates to Harvard, but it's a piece of a lot of times.
Now, the problem is that even the those of the world, even those sympathic people, which is come, they like curious and color, but reduced to a footness in history, but to a foot in history, as the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, meaning our world,
The truth is that the 20th century of 300 years of not remind to be reminded or technological innovations, but more technological innovations, but as the time we were in the massive destruction of biological and action or passive destroying cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem doesn't change the problem change.
All cultures always have been sharing a dance of new life possibilities.
And technology is also the problem is not the problem is not the problem of the problem is not the problem.
The Sioux-indians stopped not Sioux and then they were their pile, and then book as well, just as min if that Americans stopped and then they were to be able to be awful and ways.
It's not changing or technology that the integrity of the enos; it's power. It's power.

Genococide, the physical exrogation of a people, but enock, the destroyed of the life-destroy of life, not just just required as part of a people, but in many areas even part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I have a young college college of the country of Chength of Chength in West-China to Lhasa.
And then then I started in Lhasa was beginning the face behind the statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my college was acced to the Panchen Lama.
And he was based on the base of the Chinese invasion.
His uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people to Nepal
His mother was prisoning because she was riched because she was riched because she was riching.
He was the prisoner to the prisoning of the prisoned when he was two -- he was dealing with her rocket because they don't do without hid;
The sister that heldhaftig smoky smoky in a food skam.

The pain of Tibet can be untouch, but the free of the people, is something to be able to do you fit is something to do to be able to do you cut up.
And then then it turns out to a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of untonity or we want to live a color we want to be a college world of diversity or we want to do a colle?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her dead that we focus that we directioned a general image image image image image image image.
We wouldn't just see the human imagination are perhaps to a mall, model, but we would even defined and forgotten that there are other options.
We can feel us feel in the idea that our kind of pas about 150,000] years, on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, who was given our agriculture where we had to the shape, when the potry of the shaped of the shape, and we found a replace by the priesters and we found a reaching through specialization and we found a reacher by specialization of the prief of the shaped place.
The modern industrial world is not 300 years.
And this surface history, which is not the idea that we have not the idea that we have all the answers that will have the next millennia on our path.
If the intelliligic cultures of the world is to assignificant of people, they answer with 10,000 different voes.
And it's in that song that we will discover the possibility to be discover the potential to be what we are a people, which is all in the work and all of the things and can be able to let all the people, and we can get bloom all the grid of optimism.
This photograph in the northern point of Baffin Island then taking with Inextently on the pinks.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friend, for the Inon. In the 1950s, to the 1950s, to focus to see, in the 1950s,
The opa of Olayuck was going to go to go.
The family for his life and the family for his life and deally already him all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inter-didn't afraid for the colle; they use of it.
The glass were caused to be made from their bad origial warming in fish in caribooth.
Olayuks the pools was not afraid for the pool, or the storm that was going to be the storm that was going to be the storm that was saying for the pool.
He went out out out to extremely reached his bounds, and he started poeped in his hand. When the poet, he started to freeze, he started a limmal as a limet.
He brought a low-taking speeches on the sides of the side.
And then he was solide was, he was a dog of them.
He was dealed the dog and improvised a hear.
From the ribbbances he made a bad one.
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood from, including poeps.
And then with nothing to come around with nothing to do is symbold, in many ways, is symbollowing the Intermination of the Inter-folks in the world.
In april 19999 gave the Canadian government of the Inter-from a piece of country larger than California and Texas sams and Texas so, it's called our new home.
It's independent. They regularly removed all the ground.
It's a regular example of how a native enough gdossation enough.
And finally, I think it's clear to the most of the world is done for who is the way to this high of the world is actually actually not very away to get away away to get away away from the world --
They're somebodyland.
They are defined from the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, will be the dreams of these childhood from the undouble of the unfrom.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely from the idea that politicians never get something that politicians never get something to get something to get something like this.

where all the wisdom of all the people, can be working on our sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about you about some question of assumption that I had been a book in which I had been defined a book in which I had been able to ask up with you a book in which I had been defined on which I had been defined on which I had did.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
And I try to explain some of a little bit of a little bit of you who you might have been detect with you,
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be, the official dogma of all the Westers;
And that official dogma is affect as a follow-single of our citizens on the highest level, we need to get them as much as possible to give them so much as possible freedom as possible freedom as possible.
Freedom is a big good good good good ded, an essential part of the human exist.
And the vendies free freedom to treat the top of us to treat a higher well-solid without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicically.
More choices are holds in that people are freedom
And more freedom means automatically more welfar.
This is so deep so deep in our society that nobody would be deep doubt.
And in our lives is this dogma urban excited up.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
Nart that 175 changes, threats are threats in my supermarket 10 different fores of extraordinary virin the supermarket and twices and double.
And you can make a task of the tiny of the case of the case between those 175 species for you, nothing to you.
So that's the attched of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can get your strong itself -- you can imagine, cassettesple -- cassettesple -- cassetttesple --
And in that one electronicawinkle whatever, you can choose from this attle.
You can be a six-half million different systems, with with parts of those wine.
From a lot -- then you have a lot of choices -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago -- long ago you could do all kinds of the animals, but only at Ma Bell.
You were houring the apply of it. You didn't bought it.
And that had the way the advantage that it never go.
That time is for.
And in fact, there are a lot of different apply apply different across it.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the tools -- who are with the m3-player, neusiod and crative crative and crative fuels and clear.
And you don't have this model that is not in the winks, but you can see, but you can sure that that's happening.
The sequenc: people come to the winke, and imagined this question.
And you know how the answer that question is like?
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much too much too much too much too much as possible.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attacked more more important than the attack-suffered choices a fact.
Gezonth care, it's not in the U.S. incentive is not that you go to the doctor you go to doctor what you have to do,
No, you go to the doctor, and they said, "We can do A thing, or we can do Bray to do Br.
A has this formed forward.
By has this formed and nadel. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what do you find out of what do you find find out of the thing?"
And the doctor says, "A has this forward, and the Bray has this forward and afterwards.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was you, if you was doing me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own include of patient."
That sounds very positive, but in fact, that the heavy of decision that the sware of decipal of things -- the doctor, somebody who are frequire, somebody who free free and not the best condition to take decision to take decision to take decision to take decision to take a lot of recipe -- the patients are made much more reciveral meant to take a lot of a lot of residentific member.
Good destate that ner's somewhere in the goals, because the goals.
Why do do do if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we are the next morning our doctor to ask that other brand ask to ask that other branch memorness.
Our identy, yet a ingriping aspect of us existing aspect of us are choices like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is the way of background.
We are really often from ourselves -- so we just want to do ourselves.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what you want to be thinking about what person you want to be able to think of what person you want to be think.
Let's talk about the marriage, the geone.
There is a time that free that free everybody looks like to get so quickly as possible and then then then as possible and then then as possible to children beginning to children beginning to children beginning to children
The only choice was with who, with who, not when and what you did was what you do.
Now free everything for the opportunity for the opportunities.
I just give you intelligent students, I was equal students, who I was double in the houwork of equal work --
They don't dommer or than in early than in early early in the early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Sell I trust or not? Do I now trust now?
Or do I wait? Do I first children, or a care?"
These are everything is defining questions.
They go through to them have a answer to have a answer to have a good number of work and then not a good number of them and then no good number of it.
And they have right. It's important life.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just already that technology is to work every minute of every day in the world where in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place that I love secret that I love with the WiFi is doing it.
I don't think because I want to keep that place for me, I want to keep the place for myself.
But good, who keuicfreedom of work in that we are working in that we go to the question of us and then whether we go to work or not.
We can look at a football of our son our son on the one hand, with us on one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all ask out of the question of that dedicate from those dedicated with all sorts of question: "Am I ask this phone, "For answer?
Are I response this emailt email, I writing this letter?
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we look at the large, the large, the small, materialistic things, life-style of lifesty: life is a issue.
That's how the world used to be there out.
There were some choices, but not anything was a issue of choos;
And so the world looks like.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad or bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bad or b
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about what is a lot of it.
That huge choicicy has two effects, two more more effects on the ment.
A very contradictions is that the earlier than free is that the earlier.
And so many choices people find the hard to people the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically here of a very dramatically, of a research to investment in voluntemptation in free of it.
A colleague of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million employees about 2,000 vements about 2,000 vements.
They discovered that for every deal of pollution foundations that took the work-worked the partnership, the participal two percent of the deal with the partname of dished that was the work-ad,
At fif-founds. Why'd decades with five percent of the employees in five founds. Why?
Because it in fifg foundly so disconnected to choose that people just exactly the choices to the next day, and that was like, and that was like, and so forth.
And of the such comes from the point.
That means not just that people after their pensionate at their job is not to eat because they have not been able to eat because they have been such as they have been such as a lot of dealt that they have the work-such as they have been a lot of deal with these profoundly as they have been demonstrate for dealt that they have the worked for them to have a deal with the cho
And they had been doing this for 5,000 dollars a year to their nose for.
The worked was a crafar to divide their own contributor to double their own contribut.
And so many choicically, so can be lowered to work on the connect.
And I think the world looks like this.
If it go to the century is you to make the century choices are the right choices of the right choices are choices to?
You don't want to be repulling with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second thing is that we had the lost thing that if we had the lost of our dissection, finally less than the result of the result of the result of the result than the case would be when we had feel et.
There are more than doing reasons for doing for it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tasy touches from the choice.
You ask in this case that would be a different choice would be better for a different choice.
This is drought alternative is that you get to get your choice.
And then so, set off the follow-dead of choice, even as it was a good choice.
The more options are going to be able to easier to have spired from unable to have both expose options of the geodd option.
A second reason has to do with substitutic costs.
Dan Gilbert gave morning, already morning to how often we depend the value of things that we are going to be comparing them up.
If you can inish your many alternatives you can intent, you can intentially the attractive opportunities that you were determination that you were determination that you were determination that you were determination that you were determination that you were determination that you can imagine,
That makes you feel less of the alternative that you have chose to have bought the alternative that you have bough.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under the Jull: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a single in the Hamptons.
They have a third wouncing.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend again.
Beter can be right? "Don't be carry," thinks that man, "It's caught cars.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city extinclude exction.
I could be my car for the door, for the door."
And he is two weeks to the idea that he was the idea that he was a great parking place that he was misled.
And substitution cost of the people, we have to have the equivalent of our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are more potential alternative alternatives.
And those presents are presenting to us as substitutional costs.
Another example.
This imagination is the image of the points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and you don't have to concept things that you have to contemporary things like this.
Another point is that you can do with every choice other choice.
And all that other has so attractive optional optional optional optional option,
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this for my search for a new breet.
I turned almost always spirit was saying it.
And the birth, there was only one kind of stuff, and you thank you very much. The past. The past totally ununcomfortable, but if you were the blown long, and often enough ways, felt enough and often enough wasted enough and often enough ways, felt one.
And then I went to the winkle for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to put a jump, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Do you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you or a rock or a rit? Why you were stone-washe?
Do you want to get a breezes effect?
Do you can explain something extension or flee; and so he went out of pipon." And so he went on.
I was there of a spraseems from it. After a while, I said, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea what breets was that was and so I have a hours all the possible bly entered by all the possible breets of the power.
And I think of the first thing I would explain the winkle eventually explored with a explored bit.
I had been doing it better for for that possibilities I could do it.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To this to myself out of myself, I wrote a book in my life.
The reason I didn't feel better, I didn't feel better, was that I started expect to expect of a good spirit of a good spirit of a good spirit.
I started without any expectation, because I was only one kind of spirit was a kind of spirit was a kind of spirit --
And then then there would be different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
And what I was a good thing I was not perfect.
And so I removed my bhouse with my expectations, and that asked me teleggs me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to expect more expectations about the deserves of those possibilities.
And that means people are less tpeace with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marke-ingings people know this.
Because in that case you didn't know where I'm talking about what I'm talking about now.
In the real thing is about so on.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a little bit more surprising experience.

The secret of happiness -- this is for you, and you all all of this -- the secret of happiness is not too much as much as much as well.
I want to do do -- a little bit of a carbiographical elementally -- I was a woman who is really fantastic elementally fantastic is really fantastic elementally --
I have asked me with her less tacked me with her feet.
But with less enough needs to be good changes.
And then then then when you are a bad jumped to, you can buy bbt, if you can buy the question of imagining is you can ask your deal with why you can you deal with why you are intouched.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsially. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available and you buy a that turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer to the answer is just so simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different jobs to failure.
So if people are declining decide, even as the results of those are decisioned to be good decide about their choice.
And they take themselves, they will be quale.
In the Western society is focus under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the
A factor -- not the one factor -- not the significant factor in this explosive depression and suicial suicial and self-suicial experiences have because of their high expectances have founds.
And if they try to explain to explain itself, they give themselves, they give himself the wultar.
So the nettory is that we have talked about it is that we were talking about it.
Another a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is being attacked by anywhere where to be approach.

It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than not choose to be better than they don't move that more choice, but they don't get better is more choice.
There is a magical ground, and choicices are choicices I don't know.
But I know that we have been affected for a long time that choices are profeshimself well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- I am almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries comes from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard about that we have heard about where the problem is that there is too much choice, but right that there is too few choice.
So the paradox I speak here with this is to the moderne, which is to be the moderne, which is the West.

Everybody is better from reversion of the reversion of well-frequire -- and that comes from the choicicity that we are with with our lives.
Finally, if you read this image story -- you know, you read as a development, "Ach, what does that fish is there no?
Nothing is possible in a fish come."
A scral example, a shortile worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I understood about it, I understood that this fish I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you get the fishing to create possibilities, you don't have a freedom, but you don't have a freedom of the crazy.
