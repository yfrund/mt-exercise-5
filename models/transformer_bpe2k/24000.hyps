Last year, I showed these two dia's to show that the pooly cap, who was the pool, who had about three million years of the vastant had about the size of the United States with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States was flowing up the poolijump of the United States,
But this particular problem is the nice of this particular problem because it doesn't allows the ice of ice of the ice of ice of ice that ice is that the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of ice of the ice of the ice of ice of ice problem.
The ice skp on the North Pole is in a certain sense, in the shell of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in summer and crimpt in summer.
The next slide I shows is a crowd version of what happened the last 25 years is happening in the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is applied in red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
And that's the year, the year,
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called ice ice ice ice ice ice or older, is almost like flower, that from the body is set out of the body is going to be set up here.
In 25 years is the from this to this one.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen the Northern Icell and there are a very big amount of frozen woman is frozen cools that dead, when the death of meth, when the mething, microbes in methane.
Consider to the total amount of dealing in the atmospher, that could deal with the amount of atmospheres if we divide the entire point.
In some indeep deep in Alaska sign in Alaska sign of water on from water.
And the last winter was going Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to a different team to a different undeep there.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question or we will be that will be be going to be there.
A reason for that, this is that these huge warm-break fun resources from the north warms.
This is a melectwater river twater river two.
The watervolume is echer than the eye bigger than the eye of the eye.
This is the Kangerlussian river in South Wenland.
If you want to know how the sea soa's sea because the landia, this is the place where it comes into the sea.
These are flow stroms.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, including the biggest ice mass ice ice ice ice mass on Earth.
First of all, reported scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically, the ice of the ice of South Pole of the South Pole very soon of melting water-mile underwaters.
The whole continent is to six meters sea sea soil, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after two after two of years ago, are now new now, who were still in a few years ago.
40 percent of the world population is getting half of his dressing water of the meltable.
In the Andes, is this golar the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stroms.
But when they disappears disappears as well.
In California, there was a further of 40 percent in the snow,
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are going to be the predictions of it.
This global dream of dry to a dramatical trial styers.
And the number of naturere, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen seeing speed.
Four time in the last 30 years in the forward 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping bable.
If you look at the bottom from a historic context of a historic context what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 keton CO2 appears every 24 hours --
25 miles in our ocean ton every day in our oceans, look at the eye of the Stille area of Until Sive from America, and on every single sile of Indian subcontinent, there is a behavistal dalation in the ocean ans.
The only great causes of the Earth, next to deforestation, which is the solar deforestation, which is the source of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and steench, and steenched the most of problem.
The United States is one of the two greatest chain the two biggest of China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coalac centrales.
But we see a circummultiple of the
These are the coal-carbon that the bital coales that the bital years, and where green alternatives were annuation in the last year.
There is a political freedom.
The coal carbon and oil industire industire last year, 250 million dollars to promote coal of coal coal of coal coal of coal of coal of the opportunity.
And that picture was doing something like something like this.
And the Christmas was in Tennessee, about four billion liter urban carbon model.
You have seen it in the news.
This is the one after one after one after the greatest way.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertisetions of the cottter of the cotton was the Kerst was thise.
Video: "Frosty the coal man is a key cool, a cool, church.
He is followed here in America, and he cares in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scone.
He's paid and estimate and employees love their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from the coal in West Virginia from days.
The biggest mines of the country is the great blowest of Massey Coal.

And that's the reason that the reason is the reason is to give a giant engage to the light to the light and the regular of the truth of the truth of value of the truth of value carbon.
Feit is, stepped is not single set is not remarkable.
We find that soon is -- and it still seems -- and it still seem.
So, you don't make worry about climate change.
Let me show you our over.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern shell-coal-coal-coal-coale.
Fantastic! The machines make pretty much as well as well as a little lay.
But that's the sound of clean coal coal technology.
And despite the fact that the source of coal of coal warming the main causes of warming the global warming is changing the remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at good around this is the shoot coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative with our economic challenges and that on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong of crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire wire with all these section of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel oil, as pollue oil.
But now there's a new solution to get out of this.
Vore America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to the work to work and a plan that makes us safer and the opportunity of the Earth is resed.
And eventually, a solution that requires to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the needs of the power America.
Al Gore: And the last one.

Al Gore: There is an old African speakings that says, "If you want to be soon everyone.
If you want to go far far up with it.
We need to go far far away and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promise back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am here are the ones that don't waren't waren't waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever entertained in the entertain the entertained science of the entertainment of the entertainment of the engineering scientific experiment doesn't go on the enterprising scientific experiment ever in the enterta
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked less than a billions of the universe began to 600 million times a second after the universe began to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, so, thus!
This is the machine Genevation.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors where I work. It called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in connection so you can see the scale.
At 10 september last year, we put the machine for the first time to do it.
This photograph, this picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that causes a partnership in control.
It's a picture of the first particle straight that all around the way around the LHC was going around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, where in the detector in the detector in the detector of the stream.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September 10 September we knew that worked on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this is got the biggest across or this, when someone to Google and saw that the Internet page and saw the Internet page of seeing that the Internet page.
That means that we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact of impact as a scientific impact of the scientific impact as a scientific impact of the scientific impact of a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we have a cultural impact a cultural as a scientific
One week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden drams.
And those drames, 13 thousand of a thousand of a lot of powerful power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small draming."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago.
So on min 27, colder than the space between the stars, that can degree that flow flows that flow power to deal with the behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine of nine in the LHC, was a constructive a constructive construction of the nets of the nets of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the constructive in the L
And it was the wire was something warmer, and was inside, and was intensive to that 13 thousand of a thousand of a lot of commoneer and a lot of them --
This was the result.
This is another impressive as you realize that those magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of 20 tons and about 30 centimeters.
We civil about 50 magnets.
We had to figure out out of it.
We have repair of them display and we have all repair.
Now, they're back to row.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We will take it back and we expect it to measure and we expect to figure out what the building building building to figure out what the building building building the universe.
Now, of course, have these unfortunces the debate again the value of scientific research. It's easily.
I think the fact that it's so hard is, the fact that we go further than the value of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to deal with the value of the value of the value experiments of his teacher, his teacher was Michael Faratoday was so dangerous for the progress of human mind to the progress of science than to the progress of science that we have a lot of science that there are no new in the natural world -- and that we have a new in the winner."
Thank you.
I would like to ask you to ask back to your children's time playing with blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab it and conscious, and conscious, you actually were problems to the teaching up with the dealing of space relationship from space relationship from space relations.
Rumtelevision, because with understanding the understanding of the world to us.
If a information of information that inspired by the physical interaction with objects -- saming with objects -- saming my advise Pattion and my compassion of Kalanii -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer to ask -- what we would use a computer to depending on a deal with a digital finger that moves on a plat the information that we can deal with the information with physical character that we can depenpenpended physicicicicicics
and ordering order?
And this question here is so considered that we decided to figure out a answer to figure out the building of Siftables.
Sort collaborate is an interactive computer size of a cottable computer size of a cottable to cottable to interact with a cottable of a cottable of a cottable computer of a cottable computer size of a cotttable of a cottable computer size of a cow.
They can be mostly move together, they can feel together, their movement and they contain a squire and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handelblocks can be mostly moved by grabs of it.
And the vendies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is that these aid resources have a more physical ship, consciously, and even from the way we move them, there are different new and fun interactions of the way we move them, there are different new and interactions of interactions of the way we move them, there are different interactions of the way we move them, there are aware of the way
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that is playing by changing opportunities and other suses playing other sheats playing the other words,
These interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians next to each other, they will be put together together to each other.
If they get surround, they can also find this and can be able to be some nerves.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interactive consequences of the interaction, as it was a low-built color as it was a liquististop.
In this example of three Siftables emmers to go for and I can use them to go and use them color in a very empty of the empty of the things that they become a humans
If we have survey over the same thing.
There are some of the case possibilities for the education of education, especially played with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give things fast quickly the result immediately.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci running through a simple calculatory calcular programative.
And here we show you a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the randomain every Siftable, and shaped words in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds is really rescued a new series of letters with contributed possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I asked them to try to get it out.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people near near instructions of the instructions of instructions of the most interesting of instructions of this application is that people near nearly near instructions of this application is that people need.
Everything you have to say is "Most word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people test tests.
And that's our youngest ber breedomestic right underneath at the right bottom of the one.
And it seems to stack the Siftables left out of Sifttables
For him this was only blocks.
Here is an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate.
It can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters of the table.
Here he shows the sun embrace of the sun embrace of the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of scene in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done of the cheah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the near of Siftables and the near to put the characters with each other, and the nex-to--- Video: Wor!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it past.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I will show you to the day Is a synthesizer and live music in the recent of the lead, where every Siftables a sound of sound as the lead, bass and drum.
Eennion, four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want.
These sounds can be injected in the very likely of the pattern to determine the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern of the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the pattern of a load Siftable effects like reverb and movable effects like reverb and movie.
They are being an across adadded and attempted by changing the sound of the call.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are allowed to the whole pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern.
Let's see it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, lengled by an extra lead.
Now, I read the basline.
Video: DM: Now, I add a little bit beat a little bit beat.
Video: And now I coping the movie of the press, so I can affect live the effect live the effect lives.
Video: Three I can spend it very accell by the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: Now, I coping the movie of the movie for what more expression.
Video: Three I can rescue the pattern as the playing.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise everything that I can improvise and shorter as I want.
And with the same dominal dimessage from the volume Siftable to link on the left Siftable to side.
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion from the passion of new people's making computer interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brains and body body working on the way our brains and body working on the way our brains.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of element in this design area that we developed to the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the atsize of a very new generation to a very new generation of helping in the interacting with digital media, which bringing the information of our world as we want.
I thank you from hard.
I look at out of you to talk to you with all of you all of the time.
I'm writing.
Buch is my work, but also writing as much more than that.
My whole life for a long time of writing writing and I don't think that ever change.
And yet there's a little bit of the properties in my life and career, where I had to see my own own career, which I had to see my work on the work of my work on and re-re-in-followed in my work and career on the career and careerer is what happened to my work and career is happened in my life and career is happened
It began with a book that I wrote ungs a memoire: Beminndomen," Beminnergency to my first work on the world was going and an international exister to my first work and an international exister of exister of an international exister of exister and an international exister of the world was going to be intern
The sequence is that people have to go through and always tolently as if I do do job as if I do do job
And so that -- gets med!
People come to me and ask ask to me and ask ask you that success you can never evenar?
Don't you get to write your whole life will keep write your whole life will be able to publish a book that people are going to write for warm.
Don't you get to this?"
First of all, you know.
Of course, that would be very very much I remember the remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I was a teenager.
People said, "Do you have never been able to get succes?
Don't you know afraid to deal with that you will go on on the sure?
Don't you get your life on this work will be able to walk without that there are ever something like that, and you will be able to diee your broken with your broken with your broken with your souple of fail?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short comes to ask my answer to ask on this notice on this novely is to ask on this novely is to ask on this now.
Yeah, I'm afraid for all of those things that are called called
All of the time of all,
But I'm also a lot of other things job job to know what they do.
For sea whose for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time when the angst of the last time when the angst of the last time comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that someone eight is that someone eight for work to be working for their opinion.
What is so particular to create the creative processes that we make sure to the effects of the mindnesses of the mindnesses of the other species doesn't happen to other.
Take me my dad. He was separate engineer, and I can't remember me that there was in the 40 years that he was working on someone to have someone to have someone to have a job or he was working on it.
And so of this?" And what is it with your chemistry-blockso?"
No, so there was no conversation of it.
To be fair to be: scewissue engineers have been hated by the centuries of the centuries of manic, to be a little manic-depressive alcoholic alcoholic alcoholic alcoholic alcoholic alcoholic alcoholic alco
Scheately, who have such a reputation.
Not only writers writers, other creative people have been pretty instable.
And look at the grimmer death the most magic creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died young g of own, often by own own stiered young,
And even those who don't have a suiciord none suiciord to be their gaves to be their gave towards to be their gave town.
In the last interview for his death said "My each of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mitrate of mitrat."
And that's pretty much to say about your lifest.
But of this kind of excited.
We have heard it all earlier and have it accepted with the very very much as a little bit of accepted.
The hemissing is that creativity insures innecessarily connected with suffering and that an artisty eventually investment will lead to the influence.
And so I want to ask everybody here today to ask everybody here today?
Do you think about that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think about it, I think it doesn't have a little bit at all.
I find the resistant tell.
And even even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century as well.
We can spore creative minds a lot better than to live a lot better than living it.
I know that it would be for me in my situation, in my situation, particular to live to those dark thought.
She seems to be seeator in my career is now in my career is now in the fact in which my career is now in the fact in which my career is in which my career is in which my career on
Go took only young, a retig years.
I can actually spend four decades of decades.
And then, Hemain probably the publicians are still being published by the outside world as the work that extraordinary book.
We are here with friends below each other, so I can explain you to be explained my greatest success is probably my greatest success of me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think of this is what you think is for you know at neine at nine hours to the determine of the determine of the determine of the determine of the determine of the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be able to work that I love the work I love from the work I love
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think of the conclusion that I can only go through with writing as I can only with write as I can protect a psychological inside the process inside the process inside the process inside the process inside the process of the process of the process of inside the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclus
I have to write a securient distance of creating distance between mitself and my consider very understanding of reactions on my future published to the reactions on my future published to the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of the reactions of writing a safe of writing the reactions of the re
I seen the last year, I was looking at ways to ways of do that.
I am in the history of the history and deeps me in other civilizations to see whether others to see whether others to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search of the old Greies' old Greies and Romend.
And then you know, because it's a long and intricity of story.
In the time of the old Greies' and Romends and believed people didn't believe that creativity was from themselves.
And they believed that creativity a goddline that was a retable place, unknown for the human apply across the human reasonable reasonable reason for the human reasonable reason for the human reasonable reason for a dispotable.
The Green calling these calls of creativity "demonen."
And as Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had influisted him words influisted him in the words of influist.
The Romends had a kind of idea.
And in them was such a guy of the creative mind creative mind of genius
The funny is that the Romends with a genius with a genius to be a genius to be a piently piently soily of the person on
In their polar polar was a genius was a kind of magical goddal entities that were seeing in the walls of the ateltion of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house
If the artistic is the artistic assistance.
And he gave the shape of work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I talked about earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work
The artists was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you was brilliant work was brilliant to be all the eer.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius you had helped in the engine.
Where's what you crowd, you know, that doesn't just just just read you --
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Long time is that it was how in the West, in the West,
And when the Renaissance, and everything changed changed
And there was a new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human is the middle of the universe and allows all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, and, in sense of the goddal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out
And for the first time in history of artists there was a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I find a big mistake ke of it.
And to let one person one single individual to believe that he or she is the securres of the century of the century of the century mystery, of everything creative and the known present for a fragic responsibility for fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone asks the sun swallows to set the sun swell.
Ego's being regigantic proportions and there are increasingly expectations of prestations to prestations of prestations to prestate prestations of prestates.
And I think this drug has been made the last 500 years of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists of artists.
If that's so on, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years of rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of speech.
And of course, in the audience people who have reduced scientific people who have refels about the idea that elphysics of factory creatures with what parts of artists to inspiring high-inspiring high-temporing high-like inspiring high-like scientistic people who bring up the audience of artists are high and the inspiring people who are refited the idea of the idea that electricive the work
It doesn't seem to me that I will get to you in that in the world.
And yet me ask it me.
Why does not?
Why wouldn't we do that convenive to the construction of it?
The fasts just as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally calculate incalculation that is including in the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit of trying to create something -- so in fact, all the attacks here -- you know, the creative process doesn't always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process to create rational process to create a little bit of the creative process isn't always rrational process to create rational process is not always rational process to create rational process -- everybody knows that the creative of trying to creative all the ate.
And that sometimes it feeling in the entire paranorally,
I have recently the great American closer American closer to the great American closer to the American closer American closer to the American closer American closer to the American closer to the American closer American closer American closer American closer of the great American closer American closer to the great American poems.
She is a deal in the nine. Her whole life already writing already writing in the nine.
She told me about her childhood, on the Virginia.
Sometimes when she was felt on the field, they heard a poem of the country.
It was so so said she was a big wave air.
And so a close golf over the country to her allow over the country to her allow
She felt that the ground understood began to shake her feet and knew that her at that point to her life.
She ran home, and she had to pull and she had to do as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon as possible.
When the poem was close by her hended waves her only was her only chance to write it on the way to write it on the waves of writing it was in the waves her only was writing her only was the close to write it was a soever.
Sometimes she was not quickly enough.
Then rough, but crossed the house doesn't move the house doesn't move
And at the moments are such the poem of her him, disappeared by the fields, looking for the fields, search, to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- to another poem -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her wor
And if you have a lot of the -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they are close the close of the story -- that they nearly poem --
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper the paper and shes the paper by her ones.
Juists at that potle-had a potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plutched the close of the air.
She pull it close to his tail, and it back in her body, and it back into her body, as she wrote the body,
And in those cases came up with the poem of well-up paper on paper and reversed up in the entire recently.
And when I heard that -- what I thought is so far my creative process!
And this is what my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I am a mouse that every day on the same time on the same time on the same time and trans on the blood, sweat, and trans on it.
But even in that daily swine daily I had a experience of the experience of experience
You will also know it to know that sense that there are creative ideas in your recording from a source of source that you can identify impossible.
What is that that for brone?
How can we use it without that we are become a me?
At a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is a musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine of a magazine.
We had it over.
Tom is actually a great part of his life is a great part of his life was showing the toonce of the crash artistic artists that are trying to get on the unconnected creative impulses in him.
And with the 'Tom was a little bit more more than the years.
And one day he required in Los Angeles about the speed process of the process of process radical process
And as he heard about that he heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to be a inspiration that does do father, ungraph -- crowd.
It was a great melody and he wanted to further and he wanted to fur.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a pierte, no pierable.
The well-calculation of him: "I remove the melodid, and then keep it eachieved, and then keep it equivalent to me equivalent to me equivalent to me eight.
I don't have good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't stop that whole mental process and did something news.
He watched up to the air and said, "Sorry heard, you can't see that I sat the sky?"
"Do you really think I can write a song of song?
If you really want to do that this song of love to you even have to assumption when I have time for you.
And not, not, you know, somebody else are very falling.
Ga neighborhoods at Leonard Cohen." And from that point that time lose the process of course, very otherwise --
The work is even the same thing with the known dark of the dark of dark subject.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him opive the creative process in him of the genion.
The genius was close to the skin and provide only but I refrigeration
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go up with it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the propertile aspect that not completely of Tom themselves was that not quite a way of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of works.
I had been doing a profict of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddark process of Ets, Beminnen.
At a point point of a point of point of despad.
You know that you want to be working about you don't want to do you think it's a terrible disaster is going to be a terrible book it.
Not summer bad and really really horrible bad of it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project
And then I remember Tom that he remember his genion, and I decided to way.
I wished to me from my manuscrips and focus to a very much, to a very much.
And I said hardoper: "Lister thing, we know all of that when this book is not only comes to the book is not only by me.
You can see that I have in the way that I have in the time.
More of them can't give it.
If you find that it better channels to your thing is going to come to do.
Snap you now, not, you'll be thank you.
I just write because that's what my work.
Oh, and in the notile of the notable that is just a lot of opportunity."
Tja--- Ulisting it comes up here on the nex.
Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in malight to dance in malight on sacred music.
And Uren and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes happened to be something extraordinarily --
One of those dancers was transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen a little bit of a performer.
It was like the time was stilian and the dance of the past.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I think everything else together.
And suddenly he didn't just longer just a human beings a human being.
In him, under him above him of it was glanious it.
A godnment of a godn.
If something called the suffering thing happened, killing people what it was began to clap and clap in the crops and crows, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was it for them.
And by the way, a fun of historic fact, when the Mors Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish South Spaintor
The crowed is by the century of the centuries of "Allah." Allah." "Oh, Allah."
And that hear you hear the day at the day day and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magical does rop, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, Allah, great, Allah, great, and great,
At understanding of God.
And the reciipe of what we need.
Lastig is the dance of the dance of the dance in the order of the under of defined that he didn't expect on dinary ladderly has no goddal ladder.
At that moment is what he is a little parent man with deaths that may never come up to such a lot of hights will come up to such a little bit of the wallenge of the elder of the well.
Maybe there will never be somebody else in his dancer in dancing of while for his dances.
What do is that that the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sells for a creative mind.
But so painful it doesn't have to be to.
Imagine that you don't know that the most improvement aspects of your person from yourself.
And imagine you believe them you have a while you have a while you have a while source of a source source.
When you ready it, they're giving with someone else.
And so everything else is what it happens.
I have been high intivate that contemporary it.
The last months I've been working on a book that will ship into a book that will be able to did. The book where a lot to a lot of resisted to a lot of squarters to be looking at the last months.
The opolger of the illuster progress.
And if my mind thoughts with me at the hall, I like the same one: Don't recontemporary it.
Do just you work.
And just you think of the thing that is also what it is.
If you have job to dance your job is going to dance dance you go.
If the goddal genius is admitted to show in your work on some point at some point on the only source of the amazing source of the amazing source of the wire source of the goddal of the well-of-a-to-source geniion,
As that not, thank you all go.
And then then, "Olens!"
I believe that that I believe that.
"Oh, well, the way that we have pure human love and propertly, human love and propertly, by staying it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, right?
You know, I had this for a few of these projects about some of these projects about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and the discovering of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digitize of digitial code to a new fashion to a new fashion to a new fashion in the biology of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of ask the big questions
"What's live?" is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand the way to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels.
We tried different approaches of approaches to left back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of digitize the digitize of digitize
When we have sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the analoge world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask question: can we live in life to regenerate new life from this digital univers?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genitself in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can come up to a little little genome.
We can go out in the order of hundred genes out of 500 or something,
But if we look at metabolical map that relative to the metabolic.
Gell me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch out of the genes that would be very unlikely that this was very unliving cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell cell of the genes that this would be a living cell cell cell of the genes that would be able to be a living cell cell cell the
And we decided to ask this the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of components to synthesize the components to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we started a chromosome synthet?"
Staat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, a chromosome, ""ststy?
A chromosome, by the way, but a piece of chemistic inates material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitize of life is acceleration on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code of writing rather slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code of writing
And our last point that would put on this point on an exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some stadia for including a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical e
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lengths, so the longer you make the longer you piece of the longer you make the more fout.
So we had to make a new method for the confine of these little pieces and correct of all the mistakes.
And this was our first pogonation, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X174.
And that's a little virus that bacteria death that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces, the foutcorrection
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a piece of chemistry chemistry in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code particles and making the bacteria --
The virale particles were going to solve the cells, they came back and they came back and deaths the E.
I was under in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they model that model but all to well.
They laugh more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation where the software can build its own heardware is building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could varial cassettes
to understand what the deeply components of a living cells are of living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that to be digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that to be very accurament.
When we first first of all, this gene together in 1995 was the default of a 10,000 basements a 10,000 basements.
And eventually, we found after resequence. If we had the original sequence. If we had the original sequence.
And the design of the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters for 50 letters that are going to be able to build so smaller sub-unities of building smaller sub-unities that we need to design so that they can go together.
We design here unique parts in the world.
And maybe you read watermarks.
Bethinking about: we have a four genetic code: A, C, Go and T.
Trios of those letters cos for rural 20 aminozurs -- that there's an unlettery to every aminoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words on the words of words, thought.
Aanvanial signs we have only been able to do it.
Some of the crowed that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairs and put together.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces of pieces that were five to 7,000 letters of 7,000 letters for 7,000 letters of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stadium we move a floor, we could sequences so that we could sequences them because we want to create a process that is very robuust -- that you will see street you see street of your street --
We try to achieve the point of automatism.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as soon as we come to the real pieces -- more than 100,000 baseparies -- then they don't grow so easy more in E.
That explains the most of all modern tools of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that that homolog recombined that is used by the biology to repairs to repairs together.
Here is an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation that three million radiation of radiation
And that you see in the top panel, sheet of chromosome.
12 ots 24 hours later he says, exactly like the first of all, exactly as the first of all.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be dry.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can move forward to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show that there is a lot of the way, there are many of it,
Here is a really microphto from the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually with these processes with these processes with the right design of the pieces that we did.
And that's what it is that they feed automatically add automatically add up automatically
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope of light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period six seconds.
This is the publication that we exbrought including uns
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, there's 142 pages to pressure.
Now, how do we started? How do we starte? How do we activate it?
And with a virus is obviously, it's obviously.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryos, like wish: you knew the cell cell and do another in, and it does another in, and that's what you know when it was reading you as the reading of the cell of you know when it was reading your know?
In the bacterial species is the chromosome, the chromosome. And we have recently shown that we can see a full transplant of a chromosome.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbs.
These are about so far from each other people and mics.
We feed some extra gene so that we could select for chromosome.
We have it proteded with enzymes to make all the eggs of the eggs.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
We even thought that he would come to so. We tried to so.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of species that have a second chromosome of third chromosome, or a thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution evolve as if one changes at the same same same as one changes of biology has not been much biology much biology has not been a lot of biology changes in the same way of the same as if one changes of the same as if one changes of the same as if one changes of the same thing.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes are called called DNA deal DNA deal DNA is restriction of the restriction enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are enzymes that are enzymes that are enzymes that are enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enzymes that are really enz
The chromosome, the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we stop --
It was express, and the recognize the other chromosome, and the other chromosome, and so we had the cell of the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we had put in in the genes that we had in the ones that we had in the ones that we had in the genes that we had in the genes that we had in the entire that we had in the entire that we had in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the characteristics of one species, and changed completely in the new software that we in the cell software that we put in the cell cell in the cell cell of the new software that we stop.
All the proteins changed the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was exactly changed the genetic code --
This is a power of genomics as genomic, but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change fundamentally change.
Good, I paid that this is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is previous for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we may be able to make a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of the Cambrical design species of the Cambrical design and a half billion years of this digital design is to the digital design of the Cambrical design of the Cambrical design design of evolution, and I was
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what you need to look at what it need.
We're going to go inside of six-and-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my contex: I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46, within 40 years that there are four of it.
We have trouble with food, with the clean water, medicine, medicine, drugs, fuel for the six-a-a-half billion.
And that is hard to do that for nine to do that for nine
We use five billion ton collapsed over 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of vese.
When we take biological processes in ogences or whatever process than anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
And of course, there's all those carbon dioxide of the stice that comes in the atmosphere is coming in the atmosphere is going to be able to the atmosphere is of the stice of the stice of the stice of the stice of the stice of style of the stice of the stice of atmosphere that comes in the atmosphere that comes in the atmosphere that comes in the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discovery we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry but a deaster different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity of diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the electronicaans and look at the diversity that has come out of the diversity that has come out of the electronicas, but a dead of different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of the electronicamain the inisheavices that
We are preserved by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques now, thanks to do a lot of synthesemethods to do such as combined to do such a little bit of combined to do a
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing processes to produce octon to produce octon or to produce octon and produce it to produce a little team of molecules, we can change more molecules,
And it's only selection.
We can select for living vatibirth, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design image of what real design software where we work, so you can actually go on the computer and a new kind of on the computer can design a new kind of on computer
We don't know person how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We focus on four generation now fourth generation of fuel of fourth generation
Authanol ethanol ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuel that will come out from sugar, like sugar to more highly high and more higher fuels or different kinds of buttano.
But the only way we think that biology can have great influence without the food price is higher and the available to lay and the available to lay is when we start with CO2 as we are celling the first of design that we are cells to design that we can do the first fourth generation that we can do the first generation generation and within about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world -- but by our world we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepicion, about 2.5 miles deep temperatures.
It makes methane of molecular hydrogen of molecular hydrogen or as energy resources.
We are looking at whether we can take CO2 some easy to be able to be awful fabriess, where the CO2 to factory the CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out on the basal question: "What is life?"
We have realized you know -- the deaths are deeply dead.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can do this, where you know,
A important energy source of energy source
But we work on the way of using these tools to think about speed series of vaccines vaccines of vaccines in the well.
This year there was the floor, we always walk up the facts of the facts of facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change that changes from texties of the shapes of shape.
And here you see how the future can see what the future is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still ahead of the improvement of people.
Our goal is to assume that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive for a long enough to survive for a long enough to survive to survive it for a long enough to survive a chance of survival is to survive to survive that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive
What I want to show you as first of all, the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft to Microsoft about a year ago.
And it's a environment that you locally or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work on the display data can work
We look at many gigabies to digital digital images and can keep up here on the way to keep up and except the sorts of our wishs, and the sorts to our wish to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at it, how big these collections or images or images or images or images or images
Most of this normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan from the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapix.
It makes nothing because it would be only on the prestations of the prestations would be affected on a global system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a full book, a full book, a non-image data.
This is the graduate house by Dickens. Elach column.
And to prove that it is really text, and not to show that it is really text, we can do something like this is really text, to show that this is not a picture.
And maybe this is a little bit strange of strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't be adapt.
This is a realistic. This is an example.
Each big image is the beginning of a subsubject of subject.
This is really a really fun, and the experience of a real paper of a real paper of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something that we done with the corner of the Guardian.
We have a np advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of hands through the screen of hands through the screen of hands through the screen of hands through the screen of hands of hands through the screen of hands of hands through the screen of the screen at the bearms.
We hope that this is not going to be more pop-ups and other third flaw -- not need more needed to be more than needed it.
Of course, a maps of the hand a narrative application for a technology like this, I will not spend here to spend here, I will spend up to this fields to this field.
These are all the roads in the United States.
and put on top on top of the NASA
Now, let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can see it.
This project is called Photosynth, those two techniques connected with each other other people.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision research, provention to University of Washington of Washington of Washington University on University on University on University on University of University of Washington and the University of Washington and the University of Washingtline vision.
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A nice collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this, we see the images we experienced by the images and the multi-resolution resolution.
The space shake of the images has meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have brought together, so that they required with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes of you see elements of the stabilized diassions of images, and all these things are space -- and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is another time or there is another environments to show
There are a lot of space of space here.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early protosynth protosynth that we worked this summer -- to the the way to the communicate of the environments to the workable force of these technique of the environments to our website.
We had to report with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures of Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flicky and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And each of these orange chicken a image that turns out to be part of this model of model that was part of this model of model that was sharing the part of this model of model that was sharing the part of this orange of model that was sharing the part of this orange of model that recently, red.
And so these are all Flickr images that are copied in this way of spring in this way.
And we can actually take a simple way way to be able to night.
You know, I never thought that I would never work at Microsoft would work at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so explore to be so unfortune here.
I believe you can see that this field of cameras are cameras wigns to mirror-flexcameras, a great number of it, together in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange some strange images
There are so many including by faces and so much like this.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is cheaper of the program.
If we have the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, using the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entire collective memory of what is looks like -- and heading it everything like this.
All of these pictures are contemporary and shape together a little bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth is going to be a model that was going to be

If someone of these heils would like to climb and their names and their names are remodels of the Notre Dame is residentify to all of those data, and I can use as a access to the space, which metape versus of every photos, and created social experience with this cross-model, and created social experience.
And of course, is the size product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only only from the air photographs, satellities and other applications is destroy of collective imagine is dedicated from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes you enjoy software possible, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are dealed by everyone on the world can buy on the world together to copy?
BA: Yeah. What's discovered.
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the data in the images of the data in the images.
And that is emergency exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of these images are described as much of these images are dedicated images that many of these images of images that are dedicated to the wealth of semantic information that is available to the wealth of several information that is to be available to do about the wealth of several information that is what many of these images of several information that is going to have a lot of severttally exextend as much of these images of severty of several information of several information of severttentions of severtttentions of severtoolishead

And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes out of that, in terms that comes out of that, it's a classic networking effect.

I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince a man who did the psycheal adelician agency adedeaths in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines didn't identify as hallucinating as hallucinating, because when the effect intracted home, no one more home. Tryptamines are not to take origination in oral -- because they're of their effect in the order of the human arma sym in the human armine in the human arm: monoxidase.
They can only be oral oral along with something that the monoamine of sun-in-in-in-to-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-all.

All cultures have always been in a dance with new lives.

Genocide, the physical exrow of a people, universal is absolutely desire, the destruction of living the lives of living a people, but in many areas of a people, but in many areas of a of development that is actually four development of a development strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level, until you get on the basic level.
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then when I came to Lhasa in Lhasa face statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroy destruction, 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.

One day she stacked on a poorer of Mao. For this over-a-free this over-seven years awants to seven years old.
The pain of Tibet can be untouch, but the confreeding of the people, is something to do you camps.
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of untonity or want to live a colorful world of diversity or a diversity world of diversity or want to be able to live in a gray world of diversity world of diversity or want to be a colorful world of diversity or want a colorful world of diversity to be entertainment to be a colorrock world of diversity

We wouldn't only see the human imagination to a melt, model, model, model, but we would even meet and forgotten that there are other options are also existence.
We can feel at the idea that our kind of pas about [150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we crowed our agriculture to the cult of the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the shaman was replaced by the proshaman of the priests and we found a region to specialization by specialization by the shaman was only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
And this surface of history that we have been the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that will come the next millennia to our single the next ennia to our single question.
If the intelliliable cultures of the world to human becomes the meaning of people, they answers with 10,000 different voices of voices are asked with 10,000 different voices of the world to the world to the sense of the world to the meaning of the world to the intelligent of the world to the intelligent the intelliable cultures of the world to the intelligivable cultures of the world to people.
And it's in that song that we are re-in-the ability to be discovered to be what we are, a full-awful species, which is all in the work that allows everything to be able to flowers. There are greatest moments of optimism.
This photograph I have taken on the northern point of Baffin Island when I was going to take you on the northern arwal
This guy -- this guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inon. In the 1950s, to follow our soup of the '50s, to followed our soutings.

He went out to outside, listening skin, he was a hundent ses, and then in his hand. And then then the poop began to freeze, he started a limet.
He brought a low-to-sel on the sides of the sides of the wheeling of the wall.

It's independent area. They are all regions of the so.
It's a amazing example of how a nation enough enough enough of native to her people can bitate enough.
And finally, I think it's obviously, at least at least for whom at least for whom to these homes of the world is really, that they actually don't really get away to the way to these high.
They're somebody's home country.
They are stone of the human imagination that are going back to the beginning of time. And for us all the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, just like the dreams of these kids, are part of a uncrowed geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is explaining the idea that politicians never achieve anything else.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemics don't convince that stories can change the world that stories can change the world that can change the world, where we probably the best storytellers in the world is 35 million times a month, we are in 156 million times in 156 countries on TV and our magazine our during publics and our deathc public.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some questions that I want to talk about some of the questions that I have wood.

I want to start with the official dogma."
And to be exactly to be, the official dogma of all the Westerny, intrialized society.
And that official dogma air as a follow-set of our neighbors on the highest levels on the highest level, we need to give them so much possible.
Freedom is a big good good good part of the human beings of human existence.
And the sumer dies freedom of us to hands to do a higher well-of-set global spose of the things without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices lots of people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-of-making freedom means
This is so deep as deep in our society that nobody would deep deep deep twice.
And in our life is this deadthma urge of urban dished.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle great.
Even about dressings.
Unforest that 175 changes are threats of these are threats of different front of these are different entire market virgin oil and twal-engineering photographics have been awful of the end.
And that's what you can make tallow to make a bunch of the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the attack of my supermarket.
Look at electronics of electronics -- you can put your stareoset of your stareoset of cassettesple ratchcherror.
And in the one electronicastore you can choose from this number of animals.
You can assumpt and a half million different systems, with parts of those stores from those windows from those wine.
Five -- you have a lot of choice.
At another example -- communication.
When I was young a long time, you could ask all sorts of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You didn't home the allowed it. You bought it.
And that had the same thing that was never going to be able to be piece of the engineering.
That time is for.
Today, there are a lot of different applications of different across of different across of different across the different across of different across of different across of different across
And in order of cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- the middle of the major and crative fun fueling fuelels of the fun --
And the case of the model of the store of the store in the wincle in the wincle that happens inside the winds.
The sequence, people come to the wincell and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question is asking ahe?
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile of that doesn't do much do.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive is this explosive is a fact of choice.
Gealth care, it's not the United States inmiddle inage, and that that you have to go to the doctor, and that that you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A to do a way to do that.
A has this answer.
By has this and, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doktch, what is you find it?"
And the doctor says, "A has this moves, and Bose this one another, and nadelivers.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was me what would you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call "own own inbright of patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decisions of decipation of things -- the doctor -- the doctor -- to a life's determine and not the best condition to a decision, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient.
Good devastated that somewhere because the goal group, you can't buy and I cannot buy to buy them.
Why do ads, if we can't buy it.
Because they think we think the next morning our doctor our doctor to ask that other market average.
Our identity, yet a ingre-in-fingrip aspect of our existence is now overovernight.
Our identitity is of our identities of our background.

Let's talk about the marriage of marriage in the family.
There is a time that freedom that freeze everybody out of the way, you know, you can actually freezing so fast as possible, and so fast as possible.
The only reality was the only choice was with who, not when and what you did did you move it.
Now, you know, it's free everything for the opportunity to the opportunity to it.
I want to give you intelligent students, which I have done less househintive than household.
They are not dommer or in the early than in the early time in the early time.
No, they have pressure.
"Sell I whether not?
Or will I wait? Take me first children, or a career re?"
These are all such of questions.
They go through to a answer to them, as this means that they don't have all their homework and not going to get a good catch a good circle.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we come to work at work. Carl game as as to work on that technology us to work every minute of every day -- where in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place that I love secret that I love secret -- where WiFi does it.
I don't walk that because I want to keep the place for mistakes.
But good, those huge choices of work in that we are increasing ourselves in that we are increasing ourselves to him or not.
We can look at a football of our son of our son, with our son, with our son, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and maybe our laptop on soft.
And even if they all all of the things are we all of those things that are all of those death, "Am I ask this phone answer?
Am I response to this emailing for this letter?"
And even if the answer is the answer of our son the football of our son on on a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, materialistic things like life is a issue of choos: life is a issue of choos;
And so the world was the world used used to look out
There were some choices, but not everything was a issue of chooss.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about what is good about what is there is bad on is a lot of it.
That huge choices has two effects, two ngative effects on the human beings.
A very opportunity is that the more than being being being more than free than free that confreedom.
And with so many choices people find the hardly to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of it, a research, a research, to investment in volunteer plans.
A colleague of me access to investmentation data from Vanguard, a great policy policy created society with about one million employees about 2,000 vements about 2,000 vements.
And they discovered that for every 10 policy policies that have been awful far away the worked on the worked on the works.
At fifoundly five-foundations are less employees less employees with five songs. Why?
Because it is so hard to five is so hard so hard to choose that people just choices people just explain the next day, and that that I just explain and so on.
And from the initial comes out.
That means not only that those people after their pensionate at the course of eating because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to eat the choice as a little bit so solid that they have been a little bit of the works.
And they were going to be able to be able to get 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worked was a couple of diverse to double.
And so many choices can be load.
And I think the world looks like that looks like this.
If it comes to century the century of the century choice, right?
You don't want to be refoundly with the wrong funntions.
And that's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that as we dish the lost of our disources and choose ends are the result than it would be more than it would be if we had less options have had fewer options have had been as a little optic of the result of the result that would be if we had had had done as we had had the case,
There are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of the one of choice, for example, for example, for example, it can seem that the choice,
You assumpt you to have been able to be a different choice would have been better than that.
This dream alternative alternative that you get stuck of your choice.
And so, set of the choice of choices that you have made it even if it was a good choice.
The more options of being being easy to have a set of unaway from the unair of unair that element is extensive option.
A second reason has been doing substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave all of how often we dependent the value of things that we dependent on the things that we equivalent to the things that we equal them.
If you can indent, many alternatives you can see many alternatives of all the alternatives you deternatives you detect the end.
That makes you fewer at less of alternative that you have chosen the alternative that you have chosen
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is set on vasize in the Hamptons.
They have a third lawing.
They are a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No weather.
Does can be it? "Don't be thinking gusts that man, "it's autists.
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city of city
I could take my car to the door.
And he is two weeks of these weeks with the idea that he was a great parking parking place a great parking parking place.
Excent costs are cost of the people, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are more entire alternative alternatives are there.
And those presenting us as a substitution costs.
Another example.
This image store telling to some of the points.
Like up here, and now for example, and you have to consider things that you have to contemporary
And another point is that you get out with any other choice other choice.
And all of that other has so attractive to the regars that are bad less attractive to the geods.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this kind of a new blowed to a new blows.
I almost always play in the mine of the wire of the wall.
Fger was only one of the kind of sture, and you bought that bought you cought the past totally doesn't really really really really really really really uncomfortable, but if you the bad enough and often enough waste, felt it was going to be ahead, and felt enough it was incredibly enought to be a little bit of the purposed one.
And after years I went to the wincell for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to have a stuff, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you whether or a rhy? Whilt you stone-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-washed or acid-wait?
Do you have a bload with closer effect?
And then you can explain something explaining pipipes or flink out of pipone." And so he went on.
I was there of a spotter of it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
He didn't have a idea what birth that was and so I have a hour for an hour for a hour for a hour for the power of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the power of the entire power.
And in fact, I would remember the wincle eventually eventually with a biting bloat.
I had done better than I could do better do it better.
But I didn't felt better.
Why? Because of this to myself out of myself out of myself and written written a book of it.
The reason I don't feel better with all of those choice, was that I started expecting choice, I started expecting the speed of a good stuff.
I started without any single expectation because I just just one kind of spire --
And when there were different wars, and one of the such of that would be fast perfect.
And what I bought was good but not perfect.
And so I read my bird with my birth with my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
The more possibilities of people have been expectations of expectations of the deservices of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less beyond with results, even if the good results are good results.
Marke--calling people know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about it.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse to people have been able to be more surprising experienced experienced experiences.
In our modern society we can expect as well as a well as a well as perfection, but the best thing we can achieve that something that we can achieve as well as we had to expect.
None of the one we are surprise because our expectations, my expectations, towers are high-high-up and high high-up and high up to the expectations.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you all of happiness is not to much as much expect of happiness is not to much expect much expect of happiness is not to much expect of happiness is not to expect a lot of happiness is not to expect a lot of ex
I want to ask here -- a car biographic elementally -- I have a woman who is really fantastic elementally fantastic is really fantastic element.
I have a little not with less testranged.
But with less enoughs less enoughs are good side.
And then finally, when you have a bad on the judgmendous spire of the presidered is just one of the presidered you to ask why you are intestine.
The answer is that case case in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different trees are available to fall, you buy a that turns out to fall, who's is responsible?
The answer is just so simple to me is so simple --
You could make a better choice.
With hundreds of different mists to fail.
So if people decided to decide even if the results of those decisions are good to decide of their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations of higher generations of high time.
A factor -- not the enial factor -- not the significant factor in this explosive depression and suicial suicial and self-suicial experiences are of their high expectances of their high expectation of their exploiting expertor --
And if they try to explain to explain itself, they give themselves the wull itself the wult.
So the nettoresulate is that we have been there on advantage of the animals.
As a collaborate a society
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be avoid for where you get to where everybody is being attention.
But that's not the way it is not.
It doesn't suffering a doubt that can choose better than you can't choose to choose it is not automatically that more choice.
There is a magic flource of choices. Wely, I don't know.
But I know that we already for a long time of the point that choices us are several to us well.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best thing to keep the best thing to do about it.
The choices in industrial industrialized countries comes out of material is flower.
There are many places on the world, where we heard about what we heard about what the problem isn't so much choice, but right that there's too much choice, but there's a little choice.
So the paradox that I speak of the moderne, so the moderne, well, the Wests.
And that's frustrated, and this is all of this, Steve Levitt has gistrosses you told that expensive and satch kids are not helping your money.
I say you about this dure, inctive choices -- they don't help -- they don't help up to the shade.
They make us live.
If part of what people are in our society is able to make all of those choices that choices to be survey on few options, the life would be able to go on on and people on it.
And we have to go on forward.
And that's what economists a Pareto-improvement calling
Everybody is better by reverse of well-of-skills -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the choices we with our choices that we with with our our choices that we with our our of choice.
And then finally, if you read this picture of a sculpture of a developed story and say, "Ach, what knows that fish is that fish you know,
None is possible in a fish com."
A scrale example, a shortable world -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I think about it, the longer I understood better understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there's this one is the hand: If you get the fish calculation to create the fish calities to create the freedommination.
If you have the fish crossed to create possibilities to create possibilities of the abilities.
It leads to more lose and less than the peace-peace-peacement and less raction.
Everybody has a fish of mindsk to need to do it.
This is free certainly detect -- possible for the fish.
But the sunity of a figure out of a figure out of a figure out of the questions to ask issue --
Thank you for your attention.
