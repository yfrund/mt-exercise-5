Forig year, I just showed this two dia's to show that the pools to show that the pool, who had the last three million years of the vastate of the VS, with 40 percent of the United States of the United States was 40 percent croms.
But this is actually the extraordinary problem because it doesn't have the animals.
The ician on the North Pose is in a sense, in the clopple is in the clopped of our global system
It's just in the winter and crimpt in the summer and crimps in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summers in the shape.
And the next slide I show is a version of what happened the defer of what happened 25 years is happened 25 years is happened 25 years is happened 25 years
And the permanent, the permanent,
As you see, it out of the dark blaw.
That's the major of the ice ice ice ice of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer in the summer
And it slide permanent, five years or older, five years or older, as blood, that from the body as flowing up of the body is sicks.
In 25 years is the one of this to this to this one.
And that's a problem because the fors because the North Ictual Ictual warms, and there is a very big amount of women, and follove footage microckools in meth, by microyed by microcky in meth, by microcket in meth,
And the totale of the totale amount of the atmosphere's a lot of atmospher, that could be able to deal as we far the environment to the engage point to the engage point of the atmospher.
In some ondiepe in Alaska religious mes,
And then then then the Professor Katey Walter of the University Walter of Alaska with another team to another team to another ondiep in a different team to another ondiep in the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University Walter of the University
Why! She's OK. The question is echter or we will be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be there.
A reason for that, this is that this huge of Greenland from the north, Greenland from the north,
This is a smell pell twaterriver.
The water volume is echter greater than it.
This is the Kangerlussuain, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea lot of styray because it lands the landy is the place where it is the place where it in the sea where it in the sea --
These stromses are needed to be fluence.
And then the other side of the planet on the South Pole, bed the South Posmass on Earth.
And then then the maand rapported, scientists that it is a negative ice ice ice balance.
And in the wasts is the ice of the South Poil, very quickly to the South Polereilly water-water-a-water-eilly water-eilly axes.
The whole continent to six meter sea meter sea meter sea -- like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass massa, are now new market that a couple of years ago go --
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his dreinside of the drinking.
In the Andes, this is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stroys.
But when they disappears, it also also to be drinking water.
In California was a reducation of 40 percent in the squark of 40 percent in the Sierra.
It's really in the water reservicires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions --
This world educated three-ago to a dramatical styed to a dramatical stying.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, and never seen a inbelies;
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years, in the forward 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the both of a historic conteximate contexty, you can see what happened.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 access,
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, Kook at the eyes of the Stil, from the Stil, from America, and every single of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic daling of the Indian ant, there is a drastic des in the oceans.
The only big causes of the opportunity of the Earth, which is the destroy of the Earth, it's the requipments of pictures of phossil fuel of phossil fuel of phossil fuel of the Earth,
Oil is a problem, and stepped the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two grandgest excited with China.
And there was a proposed to build another cool, and build more cities.
But we see a commeasure.
These are the citized carbon which the blove bed nuclear in the last years, and where growing growing and where growing growing and growing green alternatives were prepared to the big.
There's a political streedom, there is a political stroy in our country.
The citenkool, and oil industire industire -- and oil -- and oil for a cool of promots, what a consistench, which is a connection of the considerion.
That image of the thing to think about something thinking about something thinking
And then the guys was in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally four billion literally model.
You probably see it in the news of the news of the news
This is the one after the largest of the largest of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertises of the cities of the cities of the cities.
Video: """"Frosty the citen's a stay is a stay of cool.
He is followed in America, and he cars in America, and he make our economy growing.
Frosty the citen's scene with the day --
He paid and scattace and working works, and work."
Here is a big particular from the cited in West Virginia of daan.
The largest minker of the country is the big bath of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be duidly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reventy, Harry Reven."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, the Alliance of two campaigns on your your sea.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
And Video "Bue COLwory, we see the climate change, we see the climate as a serious threat.
That's the reason why the reason is the most important to give a gigantic to give a gigantic to the light and the definitely and the definitely of the value of the value of the value of the value is the truth of the value.
Feit is, of course, not smart.
We find that it is -- and it's just a little bit of a cooking.
So, you don't make a climate change.
Let that but on us all over us.
Video: Acteur: Schone city, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern scone, you know, cool.
Fantastic! The machines make a little bit of lawings make a little bit of lawings.
But that's the sound of scene cool.
Our thank you that the fact that it is the support of the major of the major of the Earth is changing the Earth is changing the major cools that you see here all the time.
Look ook at the scene coal technology of today technology of today today today
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative alternative alternational evity.
Video: Stem: America selling in crisis, the economics, the economics, the nex-security climate crisis.
The rock in all these things, is our dependence of phossil fuel as vile coals, as vile oil and heath, as founded oil,
But now there's a durban new solution to this.
Fore America of 100 percent scent, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to the work to get a plan that us us and the operate of the Earth and the opposite of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth is to be a plan to be a plan to get the time.
And in the enough a solution that enough to solve our problems to solve our problems on our problems on our problems on the enough to solve our problems of the enough to solve our problems that are enough to solve our problems on the problems of the problems of it.
Repower America. Our task neight.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It's going to give America to the America to give America to the America
One of the speed ways to make a end of our dependence of old old old square of our planets that our planets to help our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system
Man you can make a 2: Niuwe are paid to create good pathing,
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is a parents that says, "If you want to be froming, "If you want to be going to be going to be going to be from, you go to be froming.
If you want to go to collab."
We have to go far and fastly fast.
Thank you very much.
Forig year, I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I just come back to a update about how that works.
So I am am I I think that don't have waren: the LHC is the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever environment, 27 miles in the environment.
It has to be the environments that were less than a billions that were less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, ds!
This is the machine is the machine is the machine is the machine of Geney.
We took pictures of those less Big Bangs in detectors in detectors that I work. It's called ATLAS detector -- 44 feet the ASDS detector -- 44 feet in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ASTLAS in the consuch so you can see the scale.
At 10 years of shaped to the machine for the first time for the first one.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that make a fact in the control of a tool.
It's a picture of the first particle that are all around the first particles that helped LHC gone, and with a piece of the LHC, by a piece of the LHCvalvalvalued in the detector in the detector of the detect of the the DD,
And in the other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September 10 September the machine work, what a huge is a huge consider,
I don't know if this is the largest across or this -- when somebody to Google and saw that the Internet pages that the Internet pages out of the internetpages that the Internet pages out of saw that the Internet pages that the Internet pages of the the Internet pages of saw and I went out out of the greatest action.
That means that we have a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a cultural as a scientific impact as a a cultural as a shape.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what was to do with these golden draming.
And they were behaviors 13 thousand crasing power to follow power work.
The engineers will say, "Not values."
They can do that because they can do superidend to be on all the lage temperaturs.
So on the 271 grads, colder than the sstars, and then the point between the stars, that can be away that are away that are away that are away that behaviors that can be behaviors that can be amazing the gars that can be agreen in 27,
In one of the connect between the nex-thousand magnets in the LHC, a constructive construction,
And then the turn was a blingly and was intended to the inside that 13 thousand of the 13 thousand camps.
This was the result.
This is still inpressure if you were going to be able to be more than 20 tons than 20 ton about 20 ton and they were about 30 centimeter and they were going to be about 30 centimeter and they were going to be about 30 centimeter and they were going to be about 30 centimeter --
We civil to about 50 monkeys of the power.
We had to do them out of stories, what we did we did it.
We all were all revully.
Now they are back on wead.
Eind mics will be the LHC againtace.
We will go to the way and we further and we further to go and we can go to the expect and we can go to the build of the universe of the universe are building what the build of the universe are building the universe are going to be going to be build a tunes.
Now, of course, you know, they have insounces the debate of scientific reresponsible research. It's easy to be easy to be easy to be easy to be easy to be easily that are insluence.
I think it's so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be further than the value of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientists a Humphrey Davy, I think of the value of the value of the value of the value was just so dangerous -- "Nthing is so dangerous for the progresation of the human mine to the progress of human mine that our images of our images of human mine that our imagineering of our images of the human mines are not a new that we have a definishead of the world, and the environment,
Thank you very much.
I would like to start with you go back to your children to ask up to your children when you played with blocks.
When you discovered how you had to grape, they were working and then you know, you were trying to learn and depended by the considering relationship by the contains of space relationship of space relationshiship.
Rut, Rupper is a strong of the world to understand of the world to understand them.
If a information that if a inspired by the physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- and my advise Pattion and my advise Pattion and my advise -- what I started to ask me -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a kind of the environments that would be a kind of digital engineering to the corner to the physical individual information with the physical corner to the innovest information of the enjojojojoin the entions that we can we can can can can can can can reautiful -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- what what what what what what what what what what kind of the intententententententententen
and we can ordering ordering and we want to do you to do this?
These question that we decided that we decided to be a answer to build Siftables.
Cort collect is a Siftable to a interactive computer in a cooks.
They can be able to the hand they can feel each other, they can feel their movement, and they fattacks.
The nuclear is the physical hands are physical treatmendous tremendous tremendous tremendous tremendous hands.
And in the way of Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital informatial information.
And that this aid aid aid aid senses a more physical different, and they are all the way of their movements and even of the way we move and even of the way we move interacions of the Inactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable to tell a video to tell a video to tell you and provide to be able to be able to be able to be a video, and others to be a shaps.
These interactive portravel of the conscious.
Indians as we can put together to each other, they will interest for each other.
If they are ringly engineering this and they can also be singube.
And they feel movement and dogs.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of these interactive, the use of these interacti, as it was a small like it was a small like it was a fluid like it was a fluid of the interesting of a flow-like like like a flow-up of the interesting of the interactive,
In this example of stroycles of the Siftables for and I can use them to go and I can use them to go and I can use color -- where they get ment.
If we have fight we go to go back what we go back back to what we go back back to what we go back back to what we go back to a these.
There are some of crapid possibilities for the education of education, mathematics and mathematics that we want to give the possibility and the result to probers, and the result to see the result of the environment.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple responds by a simple response --
Here we show a game that a cruision between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter to get on every Siftable, and I felt the words are controlled in a wordbook.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and different, a new series of a new series of mobilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the excurious to the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make a video of it.
They were actually actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these apppointing is that people needed instructions are not needed instructions of the most instructions of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting of these apply is that people needed instructions of the most interesting of the most interesting thing that people don't need instructions of the most interesting of
All you have to say "Most words, and they know exactly what they have to do to do.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our boy benty, right, reattention.
And if he looks like he just the Siftables wrote and apply --
For him this only bloks.
Here is a interactive painted painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carracters in the scene of the Siftable with that carakters, by just the table.
Here he shows the sun of the supposed to come up the son.
Video: The son comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene area.
Video: The orange tractor.
God done daan! Yeah!
Then the scue of Siftables and the narrace and the name of the carracters to each other, and the nex--- Video: Wit!
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a open end of a story
and he decided to be amazing how it it amazing.
Video: The cat fly fly way.
DM: The last example that I will show you today to show a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed a sound product that every Siftables and pressure the lead, and present the led, and present the basic and present the principle and pressure the lead, and present
Eengineer, four different variations, where you can use you can use what you want to use you to use your cooke.
These sounds can be injected in a temped so that you can be inject the pattern to be able to determined the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the attention of a lege Siftable effects like reverbities like reverbs and filter and filter.
They're going to be a sound and access by changed and by changes.
And the most of the general effects like tempo and volume that are acced on the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We started with a lead in two Siftables, to a lead in two Siftables, to a first pattern, by a extra lead.
Now, I place the basic.
Video: Now I feel what I feel work.
Video: And now I get the filter of the filter of the printing on the print, so I can influence.
Video: I can be a very surprising by the changed of the tempo of the tempo bloke.
Video: Now, I get the filter of the philter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern of shooks, while it as the plays.
So I don't have to be all all to plans, but I can provise it to be very longer and shorter as I want to make a lot of these.
And in the end of the animals of the conversation by the volume Siftable to left on the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion from the passion of new people's making new peop-computer interfaces that our brain and working in the way our brain and work.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design in this design in this design design in this design, and a few opportunities that we develop the develops we develop the developing of the teach.
The dad I want to talk about this is that this only the attace is just the intend to a very new generation of the interacting of digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hard.
I look at at all of you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you all to talk to you all to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to to to you to talk to to you all of them.
I'm writing.
And I write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life is a long life -- I decided and I don't think that that ever ever ever going to change that ever ever ever ever going to change that will change that ever ever ever ever ever going to change that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever write of write and I don't change that ever change.
And yet, there is something like to be a property in my life and career and career and career with my work on my work to my work to my work to be able to my work to be able to my work to be a provide in my life and career is happened in my life and career is that I had to be able to be able to be a providered in my life and car
It started with a book, I write that I have written a memoire: "Ets, Bidd," that very in the contrains to my first work to my first work to my first work the world and international exister and international existence.
And the population is that people have to be all and always told me as if I mean to do it.
And what -- I mean that --
People come to me, and ask to me, "Ben you don't know that success you can never be this success to e?
You don't know that bang you write your entire life will not be a book, but never going to be a book, where people will write for warm to be going to be able to be a book in the life will will write to be a book of the entire life will write to be a book of a book, but you don't have a book of a book, you don't write
You don't know that bang front of there?"
Eriggerous stitution, you know, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very be. But I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a teener, I told that I wanted to be a teener -- I wanted to be a teend,
People said, "You don't get success, you don't get success, you don't get succes?
You don't don't know bang for education, you don't have to such up with it.
You don't know that bang you don't know your life on this work without that there is that there will ever be something from the past of your built on the puin of your built bitter's bittery as a bittery bittery as of phen?"
Exything in that streaming.
In the short, my answer to this questions, "Yeah, "Yeah,
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are enough that are enough to be enough
Altime of all,
But I'm also a lot of other things bang, you don't want to know that all of all of the things that all of all of the things that all of all of other things bank, you want to know that for all of other things bang, you want to know that all of other things bance, you don't want to know that all of all of other things bance, you don't want to know that all of other things bank, you don't want to be a lot of other things
For example, and other enge things.
But what I mean, I write to ask myself the last time to come frow today from where that angst come from.
Is it ration?
Is it that somebody become a job for the work for the work for the work for the work for their people?
What is so for creative processes that we make our worried to the effects of the effects of the geestimate of the gestic works about what is something about what is not happening to the other thing that is not happening.
Take my father. He was screen to be intention, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was worked on him anybody to him somebody to him that was not a job.
And so that is what "Yohn, how is it with your chemistrunning chemist?"
No, it was not about it.
To fair -- well, we have been include engineers have been hone of the century of the century of the ecentury of the mountains of manic-depressed depressed coholistenive coholistenive coholists are depressed by the centur
She writers that have kind of reputation.
Not just write people have been creative people have been creative people have been instable.
Look at the grim of the death, the most magnife creative gests of the 20th century.
And they were going to be boy, often by own across by own act.
And even though they don't have a self-ord place, under their gave order their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be supposed to be a swell.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of m."
That's what what to say to say about your life.
But of this kind of exciting this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all heard the first one, and have heard it with my all accepted.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity inlocal inconnected with list and that a poor, and that a poorest existence to read to read to read to else.
So I want to ask everybody here today I ask to ask that idea of living life?
And you know, OK?
Because I think about that, I think about it I think about all I don't know it all of the time.
I think it is the weak of the laws.
And even even though you know,
I wouldn't like to see that this century is so on.
We can creative gest a lot better than a lot better than to live.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, for me, in my situation, to live to that done to the during of life.
Seker the fase that in my career now now now now now now now now be.
Ga but after you know, I am still young amper vehicles.
I can go four decades -- I can go through decades.
And the Hoogstize all I will be audience, all the outside the outside, as the work, as the work.
We're going to friends are friends -- so I can be selling you -- hope to be slikely to be behind me behind me.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think if you think of the work, you know that you know in the morning to the deawful in the vrank.
So I don't want to be not.
I love me to be a working that I love to the work I love of love and I love the work I love to the work I love me of a work.
The question is, "Hoe?"
After long after a long time I think I can just just just just by write that I can just just a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process involved in the process.
I have to create the write of a safe distance between mistence, and my government and my survive angst for the reactions, and my future audiences in my future publications.
I have been so far year to ways to do that.
I am in the history and have been doing a and have been desert in other civilizations to see if others to help a better way to help people to help people to help people to help people to help people to help people to help the creative process.
My search too has built me to the old Greieks and Romenens.
Let up because it's a long and include story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romenens, people don't believe that creativity was going to be able to be able to be able to themselves,
And I believe that creativity was a god-inknowledge -- that was a god-re, to the human beings and inknowledge and inknowledge and unknowledge and unknowledge and inknowledge and unknowledge and unkable place.
The Greeks called this guys call this decided of creativity "demons."
And we have a demon he believed that he had a demon that he had a demoon that he was influistence.
The Romenenine had a species;
And you know, you know, we were such a creative medicative medicative me."
And the graph is that the Romeneny with a genion, without a particular person on a genion.
In their policy-called a geniy kind of magic godable entition that were going to be in the murs of the ately,
A little bit like Dobs like Dobsoles.
If the artists on the work was read of the genion,
On the face he was work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the destate that I had to talk about that I had, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew that in his work in his work --
The artisted so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you don't go to work on the work was not all the ear once of the eat.
Everybody knew that was a inslic geniious geniion.
And you know, I got worked at your work -- you know, not just to you, you know, not just to you.
Everybody knew that you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Lange time is that that we have been describe creativity was describe be be describe be be described.
When the Renaissance, and everything --
There was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and folds and mysteries.
No space for mystic weather, intend from the god-in-in-in-resider.
That was the beginning of the rational house
People believed that creativity of the individual extincluence.
And for the first time in history was about artists that they were a genion, and they were a genion, and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I have to say a big front of a big front of a big front of that I think I have to be a big front of a big front of a big front of me,
To one person, one person, one one individual individual is that he or they have the securcurve the essential human equipy, of all the equipy of all the way -- that is something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something -- that's something that is a lot of the fragic human psyche.
Also, or you ask the sun in swell.
Egos are building up to gigantic provions and become an proportions and become expectations.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years of artists of artists --
If that is, and I think that I think, is the question "What do is what do is now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back on a parent, and creative the relationship between the relationship between the human relationship mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysteri?
Maybe not not --
We can make a 500 years rational of rational house not to make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes --
And suspendent in the audience of people who who have been talking about the scientific numbers have been talking about the idea that foot the work of poorder the working of poorest and the working high-teachers to inspirating the inspirating and bring the work.
It doesn't like I don't get you all of that I will get you in there,
And I well, I wrong it --
Why not?
Why would we don't have that thought that I don't want to be to to this?
It is just so much as much homors as all the other explanations of the totally include unclearly as a creative process.
Everybody who has to create something to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, and this is that creative process -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process -- you know, the creative process of the death, and all of the endone rational process -- you know, the creative process -- you know, all all the away -- and all of the events -- and so that it doesn't always have a throwell.
And it sometimes it almost paranormous ate.
I have the great American animal American animalent Ruth Stone of the American animal American animal American animals.
And they are very dik in the negenty. Here entire life they closed to write them.
She told me about her young on the platand of Virginia.
Some of the work, when they heard the work was felt to the slower to the country.
It was so one, as if there was a big golf air.
And so so we were closed to her across to her across to her across the country to her act.
They feel that the ground, they were foot to be able to scue that her on that her at that moment and do it for her -- and they were doing for her life.
They ring back to house, behind by the closer and they had to see as quickly as possible and paper and shap,
When the founded by her hundred was that her only was that her only to write it was to write it on the one.
Sometimes they didn't cut enough.
Then rings and rings, but calculate.
And in the point of scoot, it was a little bit of her him, in her her high-shaped -- in her words -- in her words -- to another disapter.
And I was going to be able to -- this I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they were the closed of the story --
Then she was in house in house and paper and paper, and it was closed by her him and well.
You've got a potable.
And with her other hand, so told me so told me to set it out of the air.
And she paid the beautiful and then it back back in her body, and then it back in her body, while they wrote the shaped and it again.
In those cases that came up to the closed in the sense of paper, but then in the paper of paper in the entire gord.
When I heard that I thought -- what I was going to be a little bit of the creative process.
And that works my creative process is not! I'm not a medium! I don't know medium!
I'm a mouse of mouse, that every day on the same time on the same time and transformed with blood, and transformed and transformed and transformed by the shaped and transformed by the same time and transformed on the same time, and transformed on the same time, and transforms and transformed and and transformed by the same time and transforming and trans
But even in that days I have, I have a experience of experience that I had.
You also know it to know it -- you know, that feel that there are creative ideas in your oprelies in your oprelationship from a source of a source of the dealing of the entire of a deal ideas
What is that they do it for bron?
How can we use it without that we are worth?
And in a way that we well?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is a --
A couple of years ago I for a time time for a time screef.
We had to go.
Tom is a big part of his life is a big part of his life the showed of his life is the toonce, and the most of all the major of all the power to the including the impulate that in him of the impulsable creative impulation that in him of the impulate that in him of the impulation that in the instance,
And I was Tom what was Tom what race.
And on a day he read in Los Angeles Angeles on the speed and changed the process radical radical radical radical radical radical radical --
And as he heard there was so he heard a fragmentation of a melodie.
And it decided to be a lot of the inspiration that is doing wellend, ingrapher.
It was a beautiful melose and he wanted to fashion and he wanted to fashimber.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper -- no paper in the tperecorder to see a tperecorder to see a tperecorder to be a paper of paper in the time.
The well-known spanning back to the melose of him: "I got the melose and then it stays and then it stay to me equips.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it to this."
He didn't have a batch in panic, but he stopped that all mental process and destood something news.
He looked at the sky and said, "Sorry you don't heard that I heard it to the stud?"
"Do you really write that I can write a love this?
If you really want to be able to come later, you have to get later, you have to do later, you have to do that, I have time for you have.
Not, anybody else will be somebody else else.
Ga neighborhom." And from Leonard Coh." And from that point the process of losing the process of the process.
And the work is still the things that is the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark itself,
But the sware spanning that creative process in him represented process in him when he disted of the genion.
The geniy was going to be able to the house and leversion just just to the house and read.
And to realize that there was no reason to go to to the engage to go to to the one.
It could be a wonderful sarch together and a kind of conversation between Tom and the property aspect that not help from Tom myself.
That story that has changed my way of work.
I have been profites of gehad.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddom.
And I give a point in want, I in want.
You know that you don't want to be working and you don't want to be a terrible ramp and you think it is a terrible ramp of it. It bad book.
Not summerbly bad behavioral bad of bad
I wanted to do it all of a project of all of the project
And then I remember Tom that who who are genion, and I decided to be a point.
I wendded me from my manuscrips and rize, and ride to a very much of the room of the room.
And I said to say, "Lister done -- we know that if this is not just silliant -- you know, it just just just by me, not just by me, not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the way I have.
And I can't give you to couldn't be to feet.
If you think it's better better than you have to do your thing to do you have to do your thing to do you do to do your thing to do you have to do your thing to do you have to be better to be better to be better to be better to be better to do your thing to do you have to be better
Snap you don't don't like thank you.
I just write because that's one of my work.
Oh, and in the notuland maybe maybe be a lot of that are just a differently.

June Cohen: Olate on!
You know, I had a couple of these projects, about a couple of these projects, about human genes and what it can mean and discovering of new sets of new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology on the digital of the digital code to a new physics to a new physics to a new physics and synthesis of life.
So we always tried to be tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels of bioloss.
We tried to go different approaches to less components.
We're now almost 20 years to the digitalize.
When we have the human genome we have sequenced, it was from the analoge world of the biology world from the physical world of the computer of computer.
Now, we are trying to ask the question: we can we create new life to create new life from this digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of digital universe of digital universe of digital universe of this digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe is we cre
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the kind of that itself-follow genes in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at or we have tried to a night to come to a little little genome genome to come to get genome genome to come to a non-to-tool.
We can go in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or son,
But if we look at the metaboolic map is that relative simple,
Geless me, this is simple.
But when we look at all look at all the genes that we can exciting a piece of living that this is a living cell that would read cell that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a stuff that we can actually read a stuff that would be a stuff of the genes that would be a stuff of the genes that would be a stuff that
We decided that the only rout to previous to previous to synthetism this was to synthetism so we could do the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started with questions, like "Can we started a chromosh synthetiserat?"
Staat the chemistry it to make this very big molecules that we never have before?
And if we do that, if we can do a chromosh "opinious "opinious "opinious "exten?
A chromosopm is just a piece of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of the digitalization of life is destroyed on exponential education.
Our move the genetic code to write the genetic code losing -- but it's across the genetic code --
And our last point that would put on this point on this point on a exponential curve.
We're going to start to start with 15 years ago.
There were a number of stadia for a couple of city for a bio-ethical education for the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very difficult --
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making to 50 letters in lengs, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you how more folds you make it more parents are going to be more folds are froped to be a degenerative process, 30 to be a little bit of the powers that are
So we had to do a new method for the society for the little pieces of these little pieces of all of the pushing of all the follots of all of the pire of the parents.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small four rus that bacteria dies.
We designed the stuck of the stuck --
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the exciting part of the began to including chemical strains in the bacteria and the bacteria and the bacteria and virtual particles and virtual particles and virtual particles and virtual particles and make vironments of the genetic chemical strains.
The virale particles were going to be on the cells, they came back to the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was inslides in speak with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but I said to well.
They laught more than you lot.
And so we think this is a situation is that that the software are hardware are in biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of great.
We wanted to build the ential bacterial chromoses.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettor -- so we could be the cassetttes -- so we could experience the cassettes --
and to understand what the deaths are the considered of a living cell.
The design is crucial information in the computer than digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer that digital information.
When we first first this genome for the genome was the destate was the standard exactly a 10,000 axed a 10,000 ax.
And then we could be able to resequencing 30 followed the original sequence of the war seat, it was not in the way to start.
Our part of the designs of the designs of stuck that 50 letters are a long time that have to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build and building a little bit of the environments that we have to build them together to designs so they can go together and shap,
We design design in fact, we have design invites in the time.
Maybe you might have a different, we have watermarks.
Bedit: We have a four letter genetical code: A, CE, C, C, CE, C, CE, and T.
Trios of those letters for the ruwider for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attention for every aminoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxyoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words,
Aanctions we were signal signs to just me.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no closed that there were no closed to be animals.
We have these pieces that we can eat them that we can eat with enzyms.
There are some of syms that they reparate and they were inside each other.
And we started to make pieces of stuck with studying with pieces of these five to 7,000 letters and go from 24,000 letter, and you have a 4,000 letter, and you have 24,000 letter, to 7,000 letter, to 7000.
In every crowd we could crowd a flowed of these stuckes so we could care that very robad that very robuy -- that you can see that you see the straks -- that you will see the straking.
We try to do it from automatishing.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so we come to the really big piece of the real pieces -- more than 100,000 amazing -- they don't just just easy more in E.
That expensive the excusion of all modern amazing the modern biology.
And so we went to rap the other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombination reparently that is used by biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair that can feel together and food.
Here is an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans radiodurans that three million radio radio of radio radio of the radiod-radiod-radiod-radiod-radioduring the radioduring of the radioduring of the gentlesod-radioduring --
You see that in the fitest paneel, my chromosopm cromosopm just from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he was several -- it was going to be in each other, exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be completely to be very did.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolute that there can be able to existence in the space can previous promise to move environment, a new aquatically environment.
NASA has got a lot of the way, that there are a lot of --
Here is a definal microph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- fact with the right designs that we are in the right design.
And it turs out to that they carry automaticically,
This is not a electronen-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiency that we excited to brought indes.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a duce structure.
The molecuulgeshaped is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spaties, without spaties, there is 142 pages to present the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic point of the genetic code 10-point of point of po
Now, how do we started a chromosophi? How do we started to do it? How do we do it?
And by a virus is the clearly beyond easy.
And by a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, as well, as well, you know the celkern and does, and you just know the celkers and that is what you know if you know if you know if you know the clons.
And you know, we have the bacteria is the chromosh of a cell of the cell of a desert transpline transplantation of a transplantation of a chromosopm to a different, and the activves.
We have a chromosopivered of a micromosed of a micromos;
These are about so far as far as people and micians and mics.
We foot what extra genes so we could select for this chromosophim ecters.
We have the conted, we have the profeshic to make all the eggests to make all the eglobal properses.
It was women, it was women's cell -- and you will stop, and you will go the very evanced images -- the new chromosophic images -- the new chromosh in the cells -- the new chromosational images -- the new chromosational images -- and it was a very away -- the new chromosational images -- and you can get the very equiped -- and it was a very sensational images -- and you can actually get the very very very very sensings -- and you can actually actually
We even thought he would come to talk to about it to go to the process what is going to develop the process what happens to develop the process of what it was going to develop the process what it was going to develop the process of it.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional evolutional evolutionary mechanism.
We found all over the species that have a second chromosophim have a third of third to the species.
People that evolution is evolved to have one and shapes have a lot of biology --
There are enzyms that restrictive enzyms that are enought DNA restrictive DNA
And it was not a chromosh that was not not easy.
The cell -- the chromosh that we stop,
It was expressive the other chromoshed the other chromosophim as a strange of the new chromosophim as a little bit of the new chromosophim.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time and all the carakistics of the ene of the encountry and change the new species, and he changed in the new software that we had in the new software that we had stroyed in the cell of the cells of the ene, and change the cell of the engineering of the ene, and changed in the cell of the engineering of the species, and in the ene, and changed of the new soften of the engineering of the ene, and changes, and
All eglobal change, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was exactly where it was changed.
This is maybe if genomics like genomics but we are in the state, but we are changing the software DNA, to change things fundament.
Now, I paid of all, I paid that this is not a screen -- this is predictation -- this is predictor on 3.5 billion years, and I paid evolution, and I paid the Camic explosion, where there are making new species that there are making on this digital new species that there are making new species of the digital new species that we were include in the digital new species, where there is in the major of the Cambrice.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what you look at what is going to take to what there is going to be a lot of it.
We're going to be in the six-half to 9 billion people, for 9 billion people, during the next 40 years.
To you know, in my context to put in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet,
for every one of us that in 1946, in 1940 years, in 40 years, that there are four years,
We have a food, with food, with the food, water, medicine, brandsts for the sense of the sense of the sense of billion.
That's a little to do that for next.
We use five billion tons of collects, more 30 billions of oly.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we go to the biological processes in ogent or whatever process than you also have a huge processes in the way that a huge challenge of day.
Then of course, there is all the carbon dioxide of the straight of the straight of the straight of the straight of the straight of the straight of the straight of the stroped of the stroyed of the strobbbits.
And by all our worldwhether we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to about 20 million genes, and I would like the design, and I would like the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is prepared that there is predicted from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the animals.
We're predicted by a biological reality and our example, and our imagination.
We have techniques to do technique synthesemethods to do so genomics to do so genomics to do a genomics to do a genomics to do a lot of the genomics to do a techniquate.
We have the opportunity to build a big robot that that can make a million chromosome of a day and make a day
If you think about 20 million different genes of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimate processes to produce octon to produce or medicine or medicine in the last 20 years, new vaccins, we can change more molecule-biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecure.
And it's just standard selective system.
We can select for lives, for lives, chemical or brical or brandst-stopportunity production, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real designers that we are working on the real design, so you can go to the computer and a new kind of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what is a new kind of what the real designs.
We don't know person how it will look at the one.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We fought us on fourth generation brandstone.
Our gone you have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come from come from come from come from come from come from like sugar, to more high or different fuel like occasional species like occurious species like occurious.
But the only way we think biology that biology is big influence without the food and describe higher and the describe and the describe as we start to read the describe as we start with CO2 as his food and we are the first way that we are the first way to the first of the first time and we think we are the first equipment and in the first ancounces of the first 18 months and in about 18 months and without of the demonths of the enjojoy of the enjoining and without of the entions of the major or or or or or or to have to
Sonlide and CO2 is one method -- but by our worldwell, we have all the discoveries of the discoveries -- we have all other method.
This is a organism that we have describe in 1996.
It takes in the deep, about 2.5 miles in the deep, at coals, at coals.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water stroy waterst-water-water-waters.
We're looking at or we can take the CO2 and we can take easy four easy and easy four easy to fabried, where that CO2 to brandster to the process to the process to hour, to be this process.
So in a short time we think that we are going to be able to break out of the basal question: "What is living to the basic question: "What is living in the basic question: "What is liv?"
We have worked you -- you know, the protected the petrochemical industry industry industry industry industry industry industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where you can do it in TED well?
A important energy source of energy broad.
But we are now now now now now to use of these workers to be servaccines to think of these works.
This year, we always had the gricult of the facts that we always just just like the fites on the right vaccin.
I think that that can change by the texes of texes, combined vaccines of texting.
Here you see how the future can see the evolution, the evolutionary is going to change the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually educated education eventually education eventually education to the evolution of evolutiontional evolved.
We're still away from the considered of people.
Our goal is certainly that we make a chance to survive that wells to survive that wellell. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you if you want to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have a new technology that we brought to Microsoft a year, this is Seedragon.
And it's a environment that you can work in a way in the distance of the amount of data can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can stay here in the way and except on the way and except the sorts and the sorts and the sorts to our wens.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at this collections are going to be this collections or images or images are images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photos, but this is a shaped of the Library or Congress, and in the 300 megapixel in the 300 megapixel of the gapixel
It doesn't matter because it makes it all of the prestate of the prestates, on a thire system is the amount of pixels on the screen pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible, architecture.
This is a completely book, a example of the not-image data.
This is the graue of Dickens. Ela colate of Dickens.
To evidence that it really really really really text, and not not a imagination, we can do something that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a book of a book of a took way to read a took of a book of it.
I won't be able to be further to be the time.
This is a realistic, this is an example. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a decades.
This gives you really the place and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or crowed mediature --
We also have something with the corner of this except of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertising away from high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make the constents of treating train the constening of hands that we can do --
We have no pop-ups that this means and other third and other third -- not to be more than you won't need more than you won't need more means and other thire flaul -- not more means and other thir-flaul -- not not to be more means and other thire flaul -- not needs to be more means and other thire -- not to be more meaning and other thing,
Of course, are agrands a for the hand for the appropriate for a technology as a technology like this, I won't spend a lot of time to this felt to this felt to this felt to this felt of the hand for the high-axes.
These are all the weads in the U.S.
And then on the top of a image of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is living on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each others with each other,
A erately regon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision by Noah Snvely, promotion, promoso to the University of Washington, aaway from Washington, aagreed by Steve Seitz on U.Wash.
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research.
So this is the Web. It's meant to the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
And when we do this -- you can see that we see by the images and the multi-resolution experience.
The room is a temporary of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images --
The computer vision of the computer have these images have these images together, so they are considered the Grassi Lakes in the Canades in the Canades -- where they are the genomes -- where they are the crazed diashot or panoria -- and all these things are the things are moving his room and all these things are crophic things are space.
I don't know sure or there is another time -- other environments and you know, other environment.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynthesis that we worked in my head, to the the thing that we have to the real power is the working on the considered of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to reach with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with Flickr. You just look for Flickr. You just get Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in the campus and the campus and equired campus and equip, and the campus and the campus and equip, you get to the campus and the crople of the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And every one of these orange gues a picture that are a picture that are part of this model of this model --
And so are all all Flickr images that are all the way of space in the way of space are going to be coperat.
And we can fignore education to figate it.
You know, I had never thought I had never thought I ever thought I would work to work to work to work on Microsoft
It's about this is that that destroying.
I believe that this many types of cameras are many types of global reflex, all of global reflex, a big number of of them in this environment.
I'll try to find what strange you to find what strange you know,
There are so much more than a lot of faces and third to be right.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- are side.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also goodgekeep by the program.
If we go four four, in a physics in a physics of this environment.
What we want to say about this is that we can do with social environment. This is now the data from everyone -- from all the data from the whole collective gegets from the shaped -- and the Earth from the Earth, the Earth -- and heads all the other.
All these pictures are photos and shapes a very little bigger than the squares of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth

That sounds very positif, but means in fact, that the sware of the decisions of decisions -- the doctors of business -- the doctors -- the doctor, somebody who has been sure and not the best condition to take the best condition to take the condition -- the patient. For recipatients -- the patients of the equiped -- the patient.
And I think that nerate that nershift, because the death because the death, you can't buy and I don't buy and I don't buy it.
Why do we do not make a copy?
Because they think that they think we are the next morning our doctors to ask that other works to ask that other market gene-average gene-average gene-average,
Our identity, too a environment, is a fingree of our exist, is now about choices, like you can see on this dia -- like you can see on this dia --
Our identities of our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we want to do but we wanted to be able to be able to --
Everybody otend to the surprise you have to be thinking what for person you want to be able to be able to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be a person to be a person to be able to be a person to be a person to be a person to be able to be able to be able to be a pers
Let's talk about the house we have seen it --
There's a time that freet, everybody else there was all all of everybody looks like you to get so quickly as possible and then you can start to kids and possible to kids start to kids began to kids began to kids.
The only realize was a while when and what you were doing was not when you destop what you were doing you front of the only real.
Now freet, freedom, all of the surface.
I just give you a lot of intelligent students, I I think about less househomework on left left of the work --
They are not not demer or lucer than in earlier than in earlier.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Does I wouldn't do it? Don't I this?
Or I will I wait? No? Not first children, or a care?"
These are all the questions.
They go to a answer to have a answer to have that means they get their househomework and it doesn't get a good circle.
And they have the equible life questions.
And then we come to work. Carl global that technology to work on technology to work every minute every minute of every minute -- even though to work, where in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one of the way, I love a place that I love -- where WiFi the does.
I don't well, because I want to keep that place, because I want to keep the place.
But good, that good, that education of work in that we are working in that we are asking and ask it -- or we are going to be working or we go to work, or we go to work, or we go to the questions, or we go to the questions, or we are going to ask and ask it -- or we are going to ask us
We can look at a footbalwood of our son, with our son, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other can, and our Blackberry on the other can, and well.
And even if they all come from stom, every minute of that we are all the way of those of all sorts of all sorts of the question: "Sould I think this phone, "Do I think?
At this email, I write this is? Sall I write this brief write this?"
And even if the answer is to experience the footbalwood of our son on on a very different way.
Where we look at at the grout, materialistic things -- the small, and life is a soless, life is a craise of cooperiod.
And it saw the world was going to be exciting.
There were a choices, but not everything was a crazy of choose of choose.
And so the world looks like the world now looks at the world
The question is that that you well?
And the answer is "Yeah,
We all know what is good to is, so I'm going to talk about what is bad to talk about what is bad to it.
And that huge has two effects on the mendous effects, two effects on the ment.
A very contravel effect is that it first become a lower than beautiful than freed.
And I think that many choices people find it to make a choic.
I give you a very dramatically example of the example of investments in freedom,
A colleague to investment to investment to investment in Vanguard, a big policy provided to about a million workers of a million worknenemers about 2,000 vestings.
They discovered that for every tions for every tions that worked that worked the worked that worked the worked two percent shaped --
And we were fifth foundaries ded, at least less working on five than five founds. Why?
Because it was at fifth foundations so lasts so laster to choose that people the choice to the next day and the next day and that you know, and that you know, and so forth.
And of course, from the point of the did.
That doesn't mean that that people didn't have have any three-death bread, because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough that was so much as a little bit of animate for a lot of animate for a little bit of animate for a little bit of animate for a little bit of animals.
And they were walking to 5,000 dollars a year, a year,
The worked about, the worked to their own behavior to redubbles.
And so many choicy can be losing a lower of working
And I think the world that the world that is just like like this.
If it to the century the century -- you want to go very to the right choice making the right choic?
You don't want to be sure with the wrong found, or even the wrong dressing.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had to be the lover, as we had the lost of us and eventually less less less strange of the result than the result than the result than the result of the result of the result of the result as we had had to be less options had had to be less than the destrange of us -- and it's the first effect.
And there are measurements for a lot of reasons for it.
One of that, for example, for example, for example, for example, behind the choics that the perfect.
You ask you in this case for that another choice for that one would be better better better than a case for that a sense of a case for that a case for that a case for that a case for that a case for that a case of a case for that a different choice for that a case of a case for that a case of a case of case for that one would be more case in a c
This dream alternative alternative to you get your spike of your choice.
And then then you get the follow of the entire choice of the choice of the choice of choice, even if it was a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options, the more options are easier to easier to have a spired of unair of the consider,
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
Then Gilbert gave morning to how often we do the value of things that we are going to be able to do it for things that we are going to be able to the value of the things that we are going to be the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the things that we are going to be
If you can indent, if you can indent, you can see a squickly the attracky of all the alternatives that you deal of all the alternatives that you deal of all the alternativves, you can see many alternatives, you can be square quickly the pursue of the alternatives you all the pursue of all the
That makes you fewer that you have less than you have a little bit of the alternative you have.
A example, the non-New Yorkers under you,
This is a little bit of the streck of this example.
This is on the Hamptons.
They have a third one.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend on the face.
And even though you can't be right? "Don't be carrined carror.
Everybody in my neighborhattan is the city.
I would flaw my car, I could do a car."
And he so, he was two weeks with the idea that he was a great parking every day -- he against a great parking place.
And then we have to get cost of the full of the full of our choics that we have a great choics we make a wonderful choics.
How more possibilities are desent more opportunities are going to be able alternatives are going to be able alternatives.
And that presenting us as substitutional costs.
Not a example.
This imagineering a number of points.
Like in the and now for example, and you have to go.
Another point is that you know, you know, you can shaped with every other choices.
And all that other has so farmerly intensible to the gets of option that are lessons.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to go to a new boundary.
I turn almost of all, I always turned to be work.
First there was just one kind of spire and it was bought you know, it was just a lot of the past, it doesn't believed the boundly enough, but if you have the boundly enough, and felt enough to be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough to be a town, you wouldn't be a crowd of it.
And then I went to the winket for a new we.
I said, "Day, I want to talk a spirit is my mained my main."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit?
Wilt you or a ritics? Wilt you crow?
Wilt you a bad with decision.
And then you know, though you know, or flink or flink on pipes." And so he went to far it.
I was played to be played from it. Na time time said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only job."
He had no idea which was no idea that was that I have a hours all the mogely boundary bound, and so I have a hours of the bounds.
And then, I just really, I remember the winket with a excited with a excited bounds.
I had been better better than all of the equipment that I could do it better do it.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this to myself to myself to explain a book.
And the reason I don't feel better feeling with all that choic, I was that I started to expect of a good speaking.
I started without any kind of expectation because I just just one kind of spire --
And then there are different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
What I was cheight -- but not perfect.
And so I really, I was my bound, and I was wrong the one, and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to expectations they have been expected to the deservices of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less tests are results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this is not know this
Because in that case you don't know what I haven't talk about what I have.
And in the really goes to be about so on.
All was behind everything was bad was big.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have still have a lot of disapped.
In our modern society as well as a well-perfection citizens, but the best thing we ever can ever be perfection as well as good as well as we had to be as good as we had to be a lot of the powerful as we had to be perfection as well as well.
And we ever get away to be surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, torenges are removing --
And the secret of happiness -- this is for a lot of happiness -- the gest of happiness is not a lot of happiness.
I want to give you -- a car biographical elementation -- I am I I am a woman who is a woman who is fantastic elementally a great great --
I haven't asked me with less tested me with less teach.
But with less enough with less enough are good changes.
And so so you know, when you get a bad sat at the spirit -- you can take a bad of predict -- you can ask you ask your instrange of the questions.
The answer is that case is simple.
The world is responsible to you didn't have a choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available, and you cooped a that turns out to fall the way of fally?
The answer is just so simple. That's you,
You had a better choice choics can make a better choic.
And with hundreds of different bounds of a to fales.
So if people decided to take the results of that are decisions are good for those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society is clinical depression on under the young generations of the younger generations of aturing aturing the guy of the young generations of the young generations of ate.
A factor -- not the one of the enion, but a significant factor in this explosive toenge of depression and self-foot factor -- it's that people have been a significant experiences have been a significant factor --
And if they try to explain the teleuration for themselves, they give themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettorulate is that we set is that we set up to predict and fellow us feel of the pull of it,
Another a collabor.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is that that is going to be able to be able to get for everybody to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the official dogma,
But that's not not that one.
It doesn't take a two-foot that can be better than not choose better than not coops, but it doesn't get automatically that more choics more choics that more choics that more choice that more choics to be better better than you can be better than you can be better better than than it still still follow out of the beh.
There's a magic grands on choics of choics I don't know
But I know that we have been a long time to the point that choices are that choices us what are providers.
Now there is a principle -- I am almost of the principle where we can keep the best thing we can keep the best of it.
The choices in industrialized countries come from material to the material away from material away from material ages from material away from material away from material in the instrialized countries in the industrialized countries come from material is from material is from material age.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard all about where the problem is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is a lot of choic.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so with the moderne, which is the moderne, which is that I think of the moderne,
That's frustrent, and though this: Steve Levitt Levitt Levitt telling and you know, the left of kids don't help kids don't help kids -- you know, sat of the money.
I say you know, I say the same about this dure, include choices -- they don't help Erigger no, they fride to shap, they fride to shaped to be a choices -- they don't help the same about this this: they help rid of the same about this thout.
They make less of our lives.
If a part of what people in our society to make all these choices to make all these choices that people have been survive to a lot of that people have to be survive of the people who have to be the life of that people on the predict of people in the predict of the people in our choices that people in our society would be a part of the people in our choices that
And we go on the present of life.
That's what economists a Pareto-a-amazing.
Everybody is better by reversion of what we have to be poor people -- not just arm to be poor people -- and it comes from the last of choicicy that we are with us.
And so you know, if you learn this image story -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, what you know, you know, what you know, fish you know, what fish is novel like this?
Nothing is possible in a vision of a vision of a visu."
A scree imagination, a shortable, a shortable.
But how much more I think, about it -- I think, I started to start that this fish.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you have the visual to create the way to create possibilities to create a freedom of the write of the dealing of the dealth, but amazing the freedom.
If you go to the fish of the powerful to create the abilities of your minder teaching.
It leads to more lower and less teaching and less teaching.
Everybody has a visual of fish.
This is freet, sure is a sure -- even for the fish.
But the destraight of a figure ure out of a figure out of a particular questions, demostly to ask and, unheil.
Thank you very much.
