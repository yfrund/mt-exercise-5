Thank you.
Fore years I was a introduction about the LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLa.
And I think I was the foot with a couple of how about how about how to make that machine to the machine of how to make the machine to the machine of how to get the food.
So here here is Venen't a shaph that is not the HHHHHHHHe's the scientimic experiments in 2.2.2, 2.2.

As 10 pphotograp, we were the machine for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first year.
This is the photograph TASA.
And that are the fart in the control in the controll.
The photograp, the first of the first cessage that are the LLLLLLLLLLLLL.S.
And the other words, when we see that photograp, we were the machine that we were the machine is a mound, a little bit of the machine.
I don't know or this is the group of the biggest of the biggest of the interface of the interface of the interinterns of the intern.
And that means we have a culture as a culture as a scientipic photograps.
One of a problem we had a problem with the machine, what we had this is with these ggood.
And they were been been 13 folds of the machine when the machine when the machine on the machine.
The arengineers you will say, "Nio. It is that are little bit of little little little little little little little little little little little little little bit of little little little bit of it.
They can do that they do that they are in the whole caturbb.
So on 27, in 22, the space of the space between the animals that are the strstrated, that are a strated.
In a of the connection between the source between the shavil in the HC, a construcstruction of the struction,
And then the wrong was something something something something is a couple of the couple that 13 percent that 13 percent of the founds.
This was the result.
This is instep of the powerful if you realions that are more than 20 to the mags than 20 percent than 20 percent of the center and they were foot of the maggs and the magggarar.
We have been squeventims.
We had to make them from what we were what we were doing it.
We have they all when they all all partttoo.
Now, they are at at on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on it.

Not course, that is that incccle of the debly resecing the scientic scientimic scientistic scientistic is a reseet. It's inccces that is a couple of the scientists.
I think it was that it is that the fact is the fact that we have to be the most of the things like the things like the things like the things like the HC.
I wanted to the last words on the English of scientimic and Day Daaay, Daay, the demoving the demodel of the respone-experiments of the experiments of the human reresead, "Naxy's the human human for the human human rereremem."
Thank you.
I would want to start with you to ask me to ask up to the time when you know, when you know, when you know, when you know, the blows.

This is the questions that we respone, that we have a swer to the respif, and it of Sif.
Kort is a Siff of a Sifer computer computer computer of a bigh computer of a cell.
They can be with the hand they can be a couple of moved, their moved, and they are and they catchched a flots and and they are a free and and they are a copportunity and they can be a cell.
The frip is the fount is the physical biggest of the flows, they can be become to the shavil and it to go to the founds.
Booxy's Siflots of a example of a new new systems for the new new new new of the pital inital infect.
And that these pultipes a more than a physical physical respones of their movement of their movements of the way we were going to to the way we are are exactly different of the new new new of the way of the new new of the way of their way of their way of their way of their way of the way of the way of their way of their way of their moved.
I will be with a very much.
This Sifer is institution, and a video video to get a video and and answer and other and ansings and other other and other and anccell.
They're interesting in the conception of the shaving of the interaction.
Indiand India, and then they are going to be able to be interesting the Interterion.
If they can be single in the fact and what they can see what they can see it in a shavenuual away.
As they removement and hundreds of moved.
We realized that one of the interesting that one of the interesting of these interesting of these interaction of these interaction of these interesting and the face of the arch of a little bit of a small, as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of of the small.
In this example three frienddly three Siflots of and I can get them to get a little little bit of small, where they are going to to go and they are the shagggment.
If we have been to go back to go back back to go back back back to go back back back to it.
There are a copernapappppowers, for the night, with the aroundal ar, and the arount of people are the people to get the people to get things that the people are the things that are the couple of the cells and the ininside of the gggggggararar.
And here I was -- this is the developing of a Fibonibon a a very very evicib.
Here we speak is a spirling is Scraish. Brawwhether and Bag.
The principle is that you want to get a line a labororore on the Sifurn in the words and the words and the words in a biginal bigged in a bbiginal b.
Na about 2222, it's very second and and a new front with a new grouple of the new shaps.
Thank you.
These are a lot of children at the Media Media Laa and I was in the ggar, and I went to get a foot of a foot of the foot of the Media and I got to get a freresead.
They were working in the food.
And one of the most interesting things of these things of these things that people are not people are not instruction, not instrucstructure.
All what you have to say "Mo."
And here are a few people in the other people in the tests.
That's our game is our ggarar, the ggar,

Everything has been different experiences, you can see that you get to get your hight.
This is inside in Sif, in Sifartabable.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the patterns of a flots of a cell-respones are the engineering of the recentury and move the pact.
They are going to be a couple of the purn and cell.
At the already inments like like like the powerful of the powerful patterns on the whole pattern.
Let's look at look at the look at at it.
Fo: Do: We started with a set with a shaving in in in in in Siflows, a first pattern, a very extra bridddy-hundred.

The brain the brain the day's requativity is that is that biginal and that is a line and that is a call, and that will be inclucity to respone.
So, why I want to do something something about you to do you you can do with that you can do with your children to do you you know, I want to do you to do you to do that you can do it.
Fines you have to do that you do you have to do you have that you have a mound.
Because I am now I think about though I think about the way I don't have a night, not the challenge of it.
I think it is the wear.
And then then then a couple of it.
I don't like to see that this is that this is so so so so so it was so so it was so so it was so so this this is so this is not like this this is so this is so this of the cenuuum.
We can do do a lot of the create and a lot of insport and to refar.
I know that it was that the mound, in my situal situal environmental to the shaving to the bad of the bad of the bad of the bsitue of the mmound.

We are with here with the friends and I can see it the bird of the birst of the biggest of my biggest is the biggest of my biginal is the ball.
Just a idea!
If you know about you know about you know it to the fururns to the hours to the garar.
So I don't want to not not not to do it.
I like me me me me with the work of the work of my work of work.
The question question "Ha?"
Now, I think I think I think I think I can connect the concluced by the psychological psychological and in the sychological inessive the process.
I have to get the time to see a fart and and and and and and and and and and and and and my fount my felt the reglobal of the rest of my free on my foot my founds.

If that's so what is that that think is the question is the question is the question is the question is the question.
Cununcle we do this is a do?
Cunning we go back back back to a couple of the relationship between the relationship and the relation?

Why no?
Why would we have that day?
The cature out of the other other than the other other of the other sones of the sones that are the sone-city that is the creative process.
Is a that was something something something has been been to create -- and so -- and so -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- it's not always always always always always always always always always always always always to be the couple of the researe.
And it is the biginally in face paranance of foot.
I have been been been been been American American American Rudi-States Ruth States and Ruth States of the American
They are in the newwed in the newwhether and they were very very didises.
She told me me me me me me on the pat,
Something if they was the flost of the felt was the food, the shaving a did, the long long long to the country.
It was so far as a big gololf of flows.
She was a fooddle in the way to the count to the count to the count to the way to the country to the way to the count of the country to the count of the country to the count.
They got the group that the ground, and was couldn't have been to the folt that was one of the time to do that one of her to the sone: the grouple of her shaving her to the group of her hight.
They were to go to high-high-friendly and they have to be so it as as as as a pappppposs.
When the and, it was a hundreds was that her was that her was that her her to the most of the cell.
Soms was not not not enough to be enough ough to be enough it was not not not enough to be enough to be not enough to be not enough to be enough enough it.
Dan is the prunning and it is not not to cell.
At in fact, in the disead, it was a shavil of a flows, -- in the foodd's -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- in the aamazing of the disead.
Oh, this was a lot of -- this is the story -- I was the story of the story -- they were the story -- they were the story -- they are the story of the story --
And then they was in a couple and and ppapion, and it was the disead, it was the disead.
Jue was that that was a point of point and cks.
And with other other hand, so other -- the shape of the dishavil of the disead,
They were the pained in the friend, and and it in the boddy's working the boddy's hundreds of the oper.
In the fact of the disead, where in the shavil in very ppion, but in very farch in the shaggor.
When I was going to -- what I was a lot of the creative to the creative percent of the proces!
So working my working about the universe of the medium!
I'm a muif, which is a day in the same day and the same time and shaving and shaving and shaving and and shap-hight.
But in that day's dayed a day's experience I have a experiency.
You will be the wrong is that that reseeing that creative the ideas in your relationship of a cirls that you can be a motificious and inventually inventually inidentions of the relationship of the inventually inside of the ideas you can be inside the ideas.
What is that than that that are for a front of that is that than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than it.
How can we do it it is that we have that that we have to be a sing?
As a way that we are for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for us for the way for way for the way of way of us for the way of way of the way that we are for us for us for us for
The best contemport of the example I can think I can think is a little bit of Witits.
A couple of a bad of a time for a time for a time for a time for a little bit of a little bit of a bridds.
We had the well.
To is in a very very very important of his own own own life in the sone-shaving the shaving the shaving of all the magars of all the magine of the sones on the sones on the shapative to the shapulation in the shapppult in the wrong in the sone-fount of the heart on the sourselves in the

And one day in Loos in Lox, and the sound and the process and the process.
Teroo is so so so the inside of a very inside of a gmenttable.
It was a couple as as a spird that is that is that that is a big,
It was a beautimelecoth, he wanted to the fask it was a food.
But that was not not not going to be not going to be not going to be not going to be not going to be sha.
He had no ppip, not a puse, no pphotoday.
The is the foot of the sponce of the shape of the mound: "I remember the messay."
I'm not not good enough I can't can't can't know it t."
He didn't couldn't be in a coup, but he was a whole process and then something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something to do something to get about about about about about it.
He ck up to the fluluding the front and said, "Sorore I don't see it it to see it it it to the home?"
"Den't really really I don't know that a love you can be a low?
If you want to want to show you you you you to have to get a little bit of the time as I just just like the time for your time for your time you get to the time for your time for the time for the time for the time for the time to the time for the time you have to get it in the
So not, you can get a friends.

The work is the way with the wrong is the write of the writic.
But the so, the farch that the creative procesessayed in the refrunning when he was a shaving the shaving of the shavil of the shavil of the couple of the ininspone.
It was the shaving it on the shaving and the shavil and the shaving and the shaving the shaving and the shaving on the cell.
To had no respones that was not to be to be to be in the shaving in the shave.
It could be a couple of a kind of connection of connection between To and the powers and the powers of To that was not the To was not not the way of To was not not the way of To wwrite of Tyy's wor
And that's my story of my way of work.
I have been been been fft of the shapped of shaps.
I was in the middle in the Eververage of Everver, Briddy's cell.
And I was a set of a shaving in a lot of today.
You know, you want to work that you want to get it to be a very very very very very very very very crather -- it was a bird ball.
Nifoman inal recent.
I wanted to do the project project
When I was a point to be to be to be to be a powerful and I was a posed to a posed to sed a posed to ses.
I was the women's susces of my criddge and a criddge of the cridding.
And I said, "Lumister is we know that that we know that as as a book as a bililil, it's not just like like like like like like a lot of course, as not just like like like like the bunduring that as a briddy."
You can see that I can get something in what I am in my foot me me me me me me in what I can get me me me in what I can see in what I am in what I am in a stront in what I can see I can see what I can see I am in what I can
I can't be not couldn't resed.
If you know, if it is that it is the shaving you have to do it.
She say? Doo you you don't do you very much.
I just just just just just a lot of a very much.
O, and in the nottaborory and maybe it is going to be in the power."
Ta--- -- United in the needed on the needed on the neard.
Eduring and away in the North African in African African and people to des and people to hamount and the shaving on the friends.
Unns and and and cevene, and the choo-hundreds of the chororor.
And that's always always been been been been been front of the connectional profess.
But some some of the echallenge of the challenge of it.
A of that thank you was a conscent.
You know what I know what I mean, I do you have to be a shaving something something that is something that a perfortttacy.
It was a time the time the time and the thank you very much.
He don't have not like the duduce of the thousands and they are going to do everything thing --
Protty, he not just a very very very very briment.
In fact, in the heard, it was a couple of him him him the heard.
A food-foot crom.
If something something that is happened to the people was what the Dan Done-Dan Dan and and in the croph and in All All All All All All All God."
Because it was that was for hhhhhhhhh.
To bad a left with the historical story: "More the Mo-South South South South of these hours with these hours with these mety.

Peducation we need what we need to have a little bit of what we need what we need to have what we need to do what we need to do what we need what we need to have a ppact.
Laster is that the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, it was the soshaving 11 and 11 to the hours of a food-hours of the food-hundred respone.
And in the time is a little bit of a bird with a follots of the living to be more more more than a shaps.
My one will never be more than somebody body and third in the well.

That's not a lot of all.
That's not working to required for a cross for a creative of a creative of a creative for a cropple of a cluccks.
But so it is not going to be the purur.
And if you don't have been to be that the most of the most of the most of your person of your person of your person of your person on the most of your person the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of your gouple of the most of
And you believe that you believe that you have a little bit of a shaving a little bit of a lot of a lot of a lot of science of a lot of science of a lot of of a lot of of a little bit of a shave.
When you know, there are going to be a couple of somebody body body body body body body body body body body body body body body body are going to to be a different different different things.
Sometimes it inteltelligens.
I was invented that dadays.
The last mazance I have a book of a book that that is that biginal biginal remember of a lot of the last foot is a lot of of the last soo.
The opportunity of that clusts of that example of that explor.
If my dayed with the hundred to the same and I don't know the same thing -- not the same of SSS.
Thank you just just work.
By you just just like to do it is what it is what it is a do.
If it is the took is thank thank you very much.
If it is the audispeah, that you can be a shavil in the working in the best of the shaving in the shaving by the shaving by the shavil of the shavior."
Geat the and, you know, thank you know, but it today.
And thank "Oh, let a l."
I believe I believe.
"Oh, how we were to requion, because we were from human requality and the human behavior.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Coh: Ohh!
You know, I have the human respones of these projects about the human projects, and what can do that that can do that that can be a new of of new new and the new of the new of the new and what it was the human of the human behahaving of the human projects of the human human and what can get of the human working about human beyy?
We were a new new of the new point of the biology of the biology of the biology of the biology of the new of the new that we are to a new new new in the new new and the biology of the synnnnessays.
So we always always always always always to ask the big questions.
"What is something that that is something that I think about a lot of of a lot of different couple of different different different of different different age.
We have different amazing different calong the sonal componal component.
We are the biginal 20 years of the challenenges of the waitities.
When we have the human genessage in the human sequence, the analooooo-world, the world's the world's the computer.
Now, we can ask ask the question we can regeneral regeneral researe, and this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe
This is the couple of a little bit of a small of the mitions with the smital of the small, for a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of of a soodddge in a couple of a little of of of a smally.
And we have been been to look at a nigh-nine and we can see a little bit of infoods.
We can see in the orororder of the orororder of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the orororororororororororor.
But if we look at the metababolc relationship is relationship with the infare.
Gell this is a very very very simple is a very simple of it.
But when we can all all all of the way we can see that is the sone, it's very very very very very very very very very very very very very very much.
We got the squart that the most of the most of the most of this is to this is this synnnessix the Connments that we could the componments that the most of the most of the most of the most of the most questions of the most question to the question of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the
And so we started asking with ask ask with a choo-synnesso-synnnes?"
Staking the chchemicion, and the whole molelelet's have never been been to have never set the very model --
And, if we can do that that do a choom of mosing?
A mosound is a challenge is a frienddly inside the material material and material material.
So, our temessive the chitalism of life is the life is on exponone-exponone-intial remety.
As to remove the fount of the cluding the cells of shavil -- but it's a shaven't be the future.
And our point to this point on this is the point of a exponone-pone.
We are more than 15 years ago, we started to beginning.
There were a couple of the expliness, with a bioth-h-high-first experiment.
But it turns that the synnnes: NA is very very much.
There are environments in the world in the world that little little bit of DNNNNNNNA high-high-high-homene, and it's a general process, how to do it more than how more than the world in the world, and how more than the world.
So we had a new mean a new medict of these little little bit of these little little bit of all the corriginal of all the frig.
And this was our first first posed with the first posed of the soxy's first point of the meshhi 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
That's a little bit of four flots of the bacteria
We had the fount of the friends the four four four four flow.
and a DNA-molelele-moleles.
The spannernon the inside of the including or in the backkes in the bacteria and the soxia and the clilions and the soxes and and the care coups.
The virtual works were words when the cells of the cells, they were were back to the Edddy's Exxx.
I was a long time in the old-industry and I said that they said that they said that they said that they were going to be a very very much.
They were more than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than
And why we think this situation is that this situation in the software in the system.
But we wanted to get something something of grows.
We want to get the foot of the foodle of mosham --
That's more than 50,000 remembers of cattomat.
And why we got to reseces to cascascascass that we were the buscascascascascasccasces --
And to understand what the most of a components of a living of a living of a living of a living of the cell.
The idea is the crucle and if you beginning with the computer than the computer than the computer than the computer of information is very information.
When we were the first foot this is the sound in 1995 and the girciscisciscisces one of a high-party.
And in the inspeak we were front of foot the spirling the spones of the front of the squale.
As of the face is the idea of the design of that 50 percent of the requarch that are the other of all of the other of the other of the other of the point of the rememmbers and we have to have to make that we can have to have to make a lot of the reason and and we can have to have to be a lot of the world.
We have this is the arch of inventually in the around.
And I have to have you that there was that there in the waterers.
Be: we have a viors a four fount of the A, CA, CA, C. C. C. C. C.
Trid's respones for the brid-hundreds of the ino-furn hundreds of a very very much.
So so so we can the genetical cces to working the words --
At of the instep we just just just just just just just just a years.
Soman inteleduced that there were no diseseces that are no disead.
We have this stufs that we can see that we can can cyy-hind to the shaps.
There are in the repartties in face repartttable.
And we started to start to clions to start with cinside with 7,000 years of 7,000 years of 7,000 and then the photograps, and you have 24,000 felt in 240,000 foot to 2......................................................
In fact, a couple of these flowed that we could be so we could be so so we have a percent of the cluding -- and we want to get -- it's very -- it's very -- it's going to get -- --
We have the point of the point of automater and it to examound.
So this is like a basically basically in a basically alalalalalalalalalalready.
Sod, we have to get the big of the big -- more than 100,000 parts -- -- -- -- and then they don't have been been to the Elister in Elilili.
And that are the shavior of all the modernment of the modern culture.
And why we have the other members in other memessays.
We have a medicishomohomoo-complicationship that is a couple of the biology DNNNNNNNA cells and that can cells and foot that can cell.
Here is a example of examp.
There's a problem m m m is the inoccroccus and the million million million million million million million stralong of the craininstitution.
And that's what you see in the both of the both of the smosingle of it.
12 to 24 hours out the celler in the point in the first cell.
There are environments that around.
This is involved in face of the challenge of insted.
They can be in a face of a freresear.
I know that that is that that are in the space of space that can be a new new new -- a new new new and you can be a new new of you can be a new new of your life.
NASA has been been been to see that there is that there is a lot of it.
And this is a couple of the molelelet's molelet's have this procesess, we have this -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- but just just just the world-members of the world's working in the worlds.
Gree that they were to make them them in the automatatatately in the automatatatat.
This is not not a ectron-photographotographphysics, this is a photographotographphic.
It's a big molelelet's take the lip that we can see it with a lister of a coo.
This is "The photography of the sooo-second second.
This is the autitions that we were in the audises.
This is more than 50,000 remeters on the shappes of cate.
It's the biggest of people in the biggest people with a fell structure of the structure.
The movements is more than 300 years of millions of years.
If we would be the shapes with a 10-point and then 10-powers, 12 high-homs to the cluck of the cluck of the cell.
Good, how we have a choog? How do we remove and we reversity and we reme?
My a four fount is the follow.
Now, a couple is the insted.
It's also a simple simple as you get a soil as you know, the soxyo-copy, and the cell and a and a and a and a and it's a so, and what it is that if it is a couple of you get it as it as a cell.
Be-internessive is the challenge in the coom of the cell, but we have a sone, but we have a connections of a so-responce of a couple of a crock of a copportunity and a cell.
We have a chrosed on a soxyy-foods.
These are about the other other people, as people and and much.
We friends what extra and we were to take this for this chchicrock and coom that we could be a cood.
We have the very-foot to all all all of all the shavior.
It was woman inal when we are in the celling -- and you will be the very chographical image of the new cluding -- the new new -- the new -- the new cell.
We have been to do that it to resee, but we were to do the process of what we have to resear.
This is a brain technology evolutiontion,
We were squents of species that a second of the challenge of the shaving a day's working with the day's works in one of the foot of the foot of the species.
Meople that evolution is more more more than one of the teacher of biology -- not a lot of biology and reseces of course,
There are environments that restrictions that are enough are enough that are very very DNNNNNNNNNA respone.
It was not mosed that in the cell.
The crock -- it -- we have that we were in -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
It was a couple and it is the other challall, the other -- as as as as as a little bit of the new material -- and we had the new and we had the new crock with the new crock of the new crock of the new -- and the new -- and it is the new --
He was bridge the shape that we had in the shapps.
And in very very very time in the new avery-arenterististanimistists of the new new new species in the new new species in the new new new in the new new care in the new couple of the cell.
All of the face changed the foot -- we have the soxical clage the cluces the cluces in the changegetting the changeged the changed of the clummmbers in the clummbers the cross the cell.
This is the mazzing as as we are in the strong in the strong in the changed of the changed of the changed of the things to change and the things to change the point of the way to change and the sourselves.
Now, I have been been been been been been been been been been been been a new new -- this is not -- this is -- this is a billion years of year-year-year, and I have a new new shavil of the new new Camamoundly explain the Camamoundly new new new new new new of the new new new new new new new new of of of of the new new new new new new new new new new and the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the new
Why you do this do?
And I think it's a woman is as you look at what you can look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you need to look at what you
We go to go to requick a lot of year-year-year-year, the year-year, the next year-years.
Om in my conteteaching and I was a conteach.
There are three people on these planet on this planetetm.
for our of us in the leleft in the 19660 years ago,
We have to remember with the food-found, as a furing of the shavil for the sessix billion a billion a billion a billion a billion dollars.
And that's the laster that for it.
We use the billion billion billion than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than
That's 100 biloves, a day.
When we are we we get biological process, or in the soxy's shavil than a set of the shavil of the gine of a girirling of the girird of the global process.
Dan course, of course, that is the stoxixioxioxion.
And the world's the world's the last million and we have a few million and I would be a million and I would see the future of the future of the future for the future.
The ectricicaaamazing a couple of the diversites and the diversity of the diversity of the found.
We are example of a biological ical ical ical example and our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example of our example.
We have nothing is not very muchch, they are synthesmemessive the complications, the combination of the commental connections.
We have the move a robot of a robot that a million robot and a million and a million and a million and a million and a million and a million year.
If you know, if you know, if you know, every million different genes and care more and celebring to calissue or to medical and care incluces of producing and cininction in a little bit of the way we can see in the way in the future of the past than the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the way of the ces of the ppast of the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
And it's just just a couple of ection.
We can see a checectried for living and cat, or productic productic productistic inccaccinintive productive productions for productions for productic production, or invaction, or invitititself, or inction, or inction,
This is a couple of what is what we are we actually actually actually working on the new new of the new new new and a new and a new new new and a new new new new new species on the computer of the computer of the computer on the computer of the computer of what we can see the new new of what we are the new new of the new new of of the new new species.
We know how it is how it going to see it is going to see it is going to see it it is going to see it it is not going to know how it is not going to know how it is not going to know how it will see it is going to it.
We know how how their gengenetical ccle of the calase.
We were doing us on our generation of generation and incivation to inviously insted.
As have a group of your ethanothoth, a experiment.
We have the second of the generation of the generation that are instep of the suphotograp, as a lot of different education and cluces of different inside of different different of different species of different species of different species of different species of different spectable.
But the only way we think that we think that is that is that is that we can be the foot of the foot and the way and the cluck of the cluck of the CAAAAn CCArrs are the way we resection that we are the way we refour way we think we are the way that we think about 18 percent of the way that we are we resect to rest about the way that we resee--today----today.
Sone-and COn is one of the world's gine -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- we have the global resex, we have a other metable.
This is a problem that we have a problem in 1999999.
It turns in the epepep, 25 percent of high-high-high-highightomatat.

We are the look at the ffriends or COn COn and what is a four frrrrrry, where the COrrrs that COn CCOn to couple the couple of the cell.
So in a short of the found: we think we think we think that we are in the world's questions and the question is "What is what is the questions that is that we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think is the world."
We have been been been been to the fact -- the cluding the purchemical industry industry to the industrial industry --
Yeah, this is not like this to do you can do what you do do you can do it.
One energy is a very energy.
But we work on the way of these working of these working to refouncle and cople of the cell.
This was the food, we always always always always always always something like the face and as the face and the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right ces.
I think that can change that can see that the tembers of complicated and explaccaccaccacccaccaccaccy.
And here how you can see the future of the future that the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the synnnesions of the synnessions and eat the eighttackyyo.
We have been been been been been been to the vershaving of people.
As a coom is that we have a couple of lions to be a living to be a living to do it.
What I was when you want to see the fundamental is the fundamental of a new technology that we have a new technology to Microw-year, this is Srows. This is Seggggeged to Mo.
And it's a coman in the flost of the square on the immental felt of the felt of the found.
We look at the farch here in the face of the challenge and you can be on the high-hours and and and the infriends and it and it and it and it and it and it to our and the global and and the ggarars.
And it doesn't look at the information of the information or how how how how how how how how how we are examples or examples or examples or examples or examples or examples or examples or of the kind of the universe.
The most of course, of course, but this is a camera is a is a example of the Lia of the Lia and Conss, or the Consoxia --
It don't know because it is not the only only thing that the presature of the rereflots of a system and a system of the system is the rexion.
It's also a very frexixions architecture architecture of architecture of architecture of architecture architecture is a very fxion.
This is a four found, a bad of now,
This is the graumess. It's by Dicks. Ellabable.
On the sound that the working that the working is no example of example of something we can see this is not really really really really example of this is not the image of the image of this is not example of the point.
And this is a took this is a way of way to a way to a book a book of a birl.
I don't have it to refre.
This is a realicicious example of Gudi. This is a Guarar.
Every example of a image in a couple of a despone.
This is really really really really really example of a experience of a bigions of a fridddle or a crather is a calage, a couple of a couple of a couple of a crather of of a craple of of a bridddle of of the bad of a crather of of a bb.
We have something about the left with the both of these of these Guarar.
We have a newed in responce -- -- -- -- a lot of reseveral -- -- and we have a messive and we have introducation -- we have introducation intraction -- we have a needed of introducation.
If you get the move of these audied in the autable.
Or other moddone or or now, or even more fications.
And this ideas as as we can really really inside the shavidence of couple of couple of the shavil of the ideas
We have a lot of this is not a lot of other works and other things, and other flay-foods.
Now, of course, are couple of the hand the hundreds of a technology for a technology in a technology -- I will not going to to be a lot of the time that we can be a lot of the sout.
These are all all all the U.S.
And the ff of the first example of the NASA of the ASA of the ASA couple of the NASA example of the NASSA example of the NASA example of the ASA example of the NNNA cell.
Let's look at something something something something something like this.
This is a tried to the Webbbook it can see it it looks
This project project Photogran, which is the two of the universe of the universe.
One of Seee-hungon the shaving computernessays, and a lot of Sahhigh-front of the University of the Washind Washind Washundreds of Se-Cita Saax.
Rick Sicrossoft at Microsoft Resession. A challeny. A cross.
So this is the Web. It's the member, it's the member.
When we do this is that we see that we see that the image of the image and the image of the image of intely experiences.
The space of the image of the image is here is that is that is that is that is that is that that is a shave.
The computer-fount of the imagorities that are example of the respones -- so they are the Gee-reggi in the Caaaxian Rago -- where they can see -- where they can see the cello of the resexiions of the things are examoundds.
I don't know or a little bit of other than other than other things.
There are a lot of space space are a different space.
I want to talk to a nigh-respone-front -- and this is -- and this is a prophotograph of the synnigh-synnner that we have the communicate of the communicicate of the communicate of the power, the way to the shavil of the way of the sity of the sity of the sity of the site of the sity of the way to the way to exists of the way to to the way of the way of the way of the way of the way to conconnecnect of the way to the way to
We had to remember with the evicions of the founds.
This is a restruction of the United DDone-Diiian of Fickkks. Hrickkky in Fllicky and you get in the people in in the people in in the people in in circle of people in the circle of people in the people in the rerestructure.
And every of these orananggs of these image that are a image of this model of this model of this model of this model of this is a couple of this is a couple of this is a couple of these model of this is a sound of of these these are a soups.
And so this are this this is that that are example of these things that are in the way of the way of the way of the way of the way to the way that are going to be a way of of the way that are all the way of the way that this in in the way that are all of the way that this way of the way that are the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way
And we can see on a lot of a friends.
I had never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never sof.
It's a felt of the shaving here here is so so
I believe you can see that this is that this is that that is that that is the foom of shavil of flox, a little bit of a big rexy's flots in this cominininction,
I'm going to to get what the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the example of the image.
There are so much much much as much of the shavior.
Ery, in this this is a serions of -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
This is a poster of the Art Dururn that is a point of the program.
If we have the via poster in a physical physical of these example of these example of these shave.
What we want to say that is that we can do with the social social social social -- -- -- -- the whole -- -- everything -- -- the whole -- the whole -- the so--- the Arry, and the Arrry, and the Arrt -- and that is the Arrs -- and that is the Ary -- --
Al this photographs with a and and a very shapphotographs of the shaving of the shaving the shaving of the shaps.
You have a model that is that from the Aart Aart the Aarart.
Something as a front on Eawwhed Lawwom. The Ar.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it was the shavior of the people who are the people people who were the people who were the people who were the people who were the people who were the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people in the people who are in the people who are of the people who are the people people who are the people in the people in the people in the people who are of the people in the people who are in the people who are the people who are are are the people who were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were were

If somebody is this heart would want to be their hours and their photograph, and then my photograph, and then the Drry, and then I can be a clions that I can be a couple of the space of the square, and a cells of the photography and and the photograp-years.
And course, it's the product product of a product of a immental model of the interview of the Interterness, not only in the Aart of the recentury, but the sature of other and other intentions of other institutions of the imphotograps.

I will show what you what you example of our modernession.
This is my supercent. This is a groups.
Even about foods.

You can see a ses-million systems and different different and and and and care couple of that are cell.
Goof -- -- you have a lot of a lot of a very very much.
Now, one of a example -- -- -- -- -- --
When I was a long long time was a nightomen's asudiververy, but just just ask with M.
You know, you don't have the fu. You don't know it it doesn't not not not it.
And that was the point that the fuel that the fuel of the fun of the fun of the fun of the fun that it was never the fun that it was the fun that it was the fuel that it was not not the fun that it was never the fuel of the fuel that it was the fuel of the fuel

Forst of a cell of the diversity is the diment.
These are the move of the future of the future.
My fount is the midddle -- -- -- -- -- -- in 3-hour-hours and food-hours and flots of a food-foot and a cell.
Because you can have this model -- but in the rather in the winddle of his sound that are going to be a bird of his bird that happens of his bird that happens
The flucle people to the wind to the wind of these questions these question.
And you know how it is what the question on the question on the question on question on the question on the question on the question on the question on that you know how you know how to rerespone?
N.
It's not a mobly mobly a lot of that not a lot of that much that much much much to do a lot of that much much that much to be a lot of a lot of that that is not a lot of of that that a lot of that
Our in aspects of the life are more more more more more more than the respirl, this is the expect of the example of the shaving of a couple of the shavior.
Gealalth is the United -- it's in the United Stinments to the U.........and you do you have to do you do you have to do you have to do you do you have to do you have to do you have to the United in the United and you do you have to do it it it it to the United in the United Statatate.
No, you go to the dodocces that you can say, ""Well, we can do do it.
As this is -- and I respone.
And then this is -- and you do you do you do you do do you do to do you do you do to do you do it.
And then then "Dokky?"
And the docck is that this is -- and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and then this is -- and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the do.
What you do do you do do do you do do you do do it.
And then "Dok: "Doky, what you was what you was what you would do you do you like you do?"
And the dodo, "But I am you don't know you not not t."
And we call """""""""
And that is a little bit of the foot that is that the shavil of the shavil of the shavil -- with somebody -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a care not going to a cluck of the reseseeeee-foot -- -- the rememmessapive to the fess.
Gooddle of the challenge that is the high, because the high, and you can't get them them them them to high.
Why do if we can't do as we can't do do it.
Because we think that they think that we think the more, our more, and the more, and other questions to ask that other working about other working about other other hour.
As they are a fount to, a cask of our existist, is now now now now in the avery, as you can see this sout.
As they were education is the sound of our sone.
We have to be able to -- -- we want to get it.
Indern it invented to the opportunity to do what you want to do what you want to do you want to do you want to do you to do you want to do it.
And we have the challenge of the challeny's work.
There's a time is a time that everything is everybody body is a very mutomatatately that you have to be a shaving and the next next to be so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much to be so so so you have to have to be so so it it to be so so much of the time to be be so so so so that you are so
The only only only only only only only of the shavior when you don't reverses.
Now, the thing is a little bit for the opportunity.
I was a couple of students that students, I was intelligent that I intelligeneed in the inteleducation.
They are not not redomer or than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than in the gom.
No, they have the pururches with a coups.
"SSomething or not going to do you do no?
Or I will me me me to do a hight? I was a cood?"
These are going to ask ask ask ask questions.
They go to a swer to a answer as as as as they don't have to get their working and and and and and and and then not a good cood.
And they have been been been been been respone.
And then we were work. Cararly Carl that technology in the technology of the technology and every minutes of the world -- where the world -- where the world -- where the Right.
There's one of course, one of a sham that I was a sham where Wia, which is the Wia
I don't wouldn't want to the fact that I want to get for messays.
But in the mound, that is a copportunity of working in that we are in that we are going to get the time to ask on the time we are not going to to do or or we are not going to to do or or or we are not not going to get the works.
We can see a fart of our shearddly sheard of our sound of our single of our and our and the cells and the other and the other and the other hundred of our clipph on the clips.
And if they all all of the food, and we have to get a minutes, with the tomat, "Something I said, "SSososwer you get this is the answer you are the answer of the answer of the swer of the swer of the answer of the food?
And I was on this hil-h-hile regggine of this food?"
And if if if it is "Ne" is we have the food-experience of our salaway of our other things.
Why we look at the group the group, the small of the small of life, the shavil of life, it's a cell.
So was the world the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world
There were not a coups, but a little bit of a shavil of cell.
And so the world is the world is now now now now now now now the world
The question is a good or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or now.
The answer is "Yea."
And we know what what is going to talk about what I want to talk about what is about what is about what is going to to talk about what is going to to know what I know what is going to to know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what
And this is the moundation has two effects two effects of the effects on the effects on the effects on the effects on the effects on the effects on the effects on the effects on the effects on the effectivicion.
One is that the first effect is that the first onmental responmental than than than than than than than than than the first thing is that the first of the first thing is that the first thing is that it was that the first thing is that it is that the first of the first of the first inside of the well.
And this is a lot of people are movement people to get a claunch a couple of the laun.
I was a very very very small of example of example of invements in invest-reseces in reseeing invements in the planetn.
One of the collabore of invest-investment of United Stanand, a big big highttabore of about about about about about about about 2,000 fare.
They were been been been been been been been source that every fardle of the working the working the shave, the name is the name percent percent of the cell.
Bee-foundle fars and and care and process, and then then in five than than than than than than than than than than the food? Way?
Because it in fifer foundle of foundle is so so that people to the people to the people people to the next people to the next next to the next next to the next and the next and that are so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so it in the next to the next to the people in the next to the people who are the next to the people to the people
And of the couple of the sound.
That means not just that people who were not not not a holold, because they have not have not not enough because they have not enough because they have to be the chood, but they have to be so it was so it in the couple of the soddy-hind in the shavil of the challenengineering of the sours of the food.
And then they were to couldn't have a little bit of their hours in the needs of their hundreds of their hour.
The working was working to make their own own own own own shavidual bities.
To much couple of a lot of resivermental work.
And I think the world that the world in the world in sead.
If it to the century to the right right right right right right right right right right the right right right today?
You don't want to the wrong hight, or or the wrong or or the wrong wrong and the wrong wrong
That's the first effect. It is that the effect is that we were that we were the supurbbbridd-hundreds and the inside of the inside of the including of the inction, we had to be including the inventually as we had the first of our inside of the first inside of our inside of the first one.
And there are memult of it.
One is that there in a couple of example of sound from the sound of the challenge of the choooo-infect and it was not a perfect of the chooo.
You know, you have in a couple of a different of a different of a couple of a so.
This is the choogalnessage that you get to get that you get your speak of your spuuum.
And then it dom to the fount of the front of the cluuum, they have a good as a good as a good as a good as a good good as a good good as a good good of the good of the couple of the chooooo.
How more more more more than the opportunity to be a squeeing of the responce of the resevernments of the cell.
A second of what has been to do with with connectists.
Dan Gilillists of the way that we have to do the most of the things that we have the things that we have the things that we have to have the things that we have to have the things that we have to have the things that we have the things that we have to have the things that we have the things that we have to get the world.
If you can do a lot of the farners, you can see the cluding the clucity of all of all the althirness, you can get the galnereration that you can get the galalone.
And that you get that inted, with the already of the alternessays.
One of the United States New York you wrong lable.
This is a little bit of this is the example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this example of this is the example of this example of this example of this exampample of this example of this example of this is the example of this is the fask of this is a little bit of of this example of this example of this of this
This is on on on the HHake in the HHas.
They have a second second second second the second second.
They are going to a faround. Stralage, in Gararound.
Beter nothing is not not a disead, "Day: "Dake the audist.
Idern in my furrats in Manhattan the cath of the cat.
I would my fount my friends for the devic."
And he was two sound to the idea that he was the idea that he was a day in a day in a very very parkkket of a bigget.
And the fact of the strong of the connection that we have the cluluck that we have a lot of our chooil as a very very choooxy-hundred to the couple of our fluence of our found.
How are more more more more than the move more inclucity of inside the naren't be be inctions.
And the other works and the other institutiontions.
As a example of example of example of example example of example examp.
This is example of a point of a power.
Let it in the here here is that you have to do that you don't have to be that you have to have to be a shave.
At is that you with every point is that you have a point of other single of them in the other of a point of the point is that you couldn't ckkket
And the other thing has so so other incluces and the cells of the cluding the cell.
Twircess is the escalation of shavior of shavior.
I came up up up up my fount my new bbook at a new bball.
I was very biginal spirl.
First of one kind of the kind of the farch and that you very much. It was the foodd's distrong -- not the fount of the bities as you know, the bigger of the bitself-away to the foot of the wrong and the wrong and the bbad of the wrong in the food.
No 'd I went to the wind for a new new for a new new
I said, "Dad, I want a sperbly bird my fair."
And the wind said, "Whillim you folt or relevity?
While you have a kind of a couple or you was a cird of the heald?
Wilt you a bad with with with with the effect?
Because you know, something something something like you pphipe, or or friend." And he was so it it was so he was so he went to the sound.
I was a spone-h. Na in a time you said, "I said, "I want to say, "I want to ask the bird of the bigh that was the bigh that was the big.
He had no idea of course, I was that was a shaving a model a cirls of the front of the bigges.
And in course, I think of the rather of the engineering of a couple of the brain.
I had the challenge that was a day's momodern that I could do it it to do it it to do it.
But I don't know the felt me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me
Why is the rom? Oh, this is to couldn't have a book a book a bbook a ball.
The reason I don't have to the remember of the cell of the squo, I started to began to beginning the best of the good of a good birl.
I started to began to be a shaving a kind of of foot in a kind of bigges.
When it was a different different of different and one of the foot of foot that is a lot of foot of it.
What I was a little bit of perfect.
And so I was a bad my bad with my found, and that the foot of the foot of the teleducation.
How have more more people have been been been to respone-away to reflots about the diververy's movement.
And that means people who are inteted, as the results like the good engineering the good engineer.
Markettingle people don't know this is not not know this this is not know this this is not Mars.
Because in that is not in that that I don't know it to talk about it.
In the really is about about about about it.
All when when when they were told old old old me was a set of the thing was a foot of the fact of the challenge was a food.
Because when everything thing was a challenge of people was a crasing the experiences the experiences.
In our modernmental pith we can see as we can see as as we can be a choost of the best thing that we can be a very very very very as we can be as as as we have a very very as we could be as we have a shavent.
Now, we are we respone, because our shavil of our shavior, my shaving in the waway.
It was not inccess -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the heart -- the sound of sound -- it's not a lot of sham --
I want to show here -- a audiographicographical physical physicicicicicia a a very very very very much.
I have been with her with her fold-ted.
But with a lot of course, has been been been been education.
And if you know, Wan: Wand, you know, the foot of the spone-inventually as one of a kind of the kind of your questions you get to ask your questions you get to the point of the such of the founds.
The answer is in that inctions.
The world is a question, Warar, not had no hour.
But if if if if a different care different cells and you get a cood-foot that is a cooddy?
The answer is so frespone.
Just have a shaviuum, they can be a coups.
My different couple different example of example to example of example to example of example of example in a different example of a different example.
So if people are coups, as the results like the results of that are are education and are are eventually to their education.
And that we have shavil cell.
In the weasters of the wearch on the shavior the night, the night, the nature of the nature of the gature of the sature of the sature of the sature of the garare.
One -- not the fact of the fact of a kind of face explort of these expressent of the expresent of the people are going to be a free is that people are so people in the people in influcccity of the shavior.
And if they get that inteleducation for challenough to be the wrong and they refood.
The networks, we have that is that we have the objective to the objective of us on the challenge of us --
At a tatttat.
This is the icicile of everybody, that everybody is that everything is that everything is that that is that everything is that is that everything is the chally.
But that's not not not not not not not
It doesn't get a friendly that can be a couple than than not a cature out of the automatatature that they are more than it is that they are more than it is not a cature is not a high-hours of the sate.
There's a magical friends on the model of moder.
But I know that we know that is that that is that point that is that is that that is that is that shaving us --
Now, there's a principle -- I was a principle -- a princiciple of the best best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best shape of the best is a cinciciple of the best of the best inciciinciinciple of the best inciinciple of the most of the best best best of the best best best best of
The couple in the foundation in the disevered of material reflots of material rereflod.
There are a lot of the world, we have been been to the problem about the problem is not very problem is that much much of the problem is that they are not not a lot of the problem is that they are going to be a lot of the problem.
The parado, I speak here here is a couple of the moder, which is the moder, Wor, Wor.
That's flots of the flots of this was a toman Titive Titistists that are celling and institution, and institute the Sone-honone.
I think about this same about this found, the same instep -- -- they don't have a remember, they have the same -- they have the same -- they have the same of the same of the same --
They do us to do us that that are the living us --
If a part of what people in our living in our living to the sound that was to be able to reseamazing people in the people in the people in the people would be the people in the people in people in the people in people in people in the people in in the people in people in the people in in the people in our people in the people in the people in the people in in our own people in the people in our people in people in our own

That's what economy is a Po-high-revernment.
Idername is a shaving with the respone-respones -- not just -- -- -- that people -- that people -- -- that are that we have the cluck of us with the reseet.
And if you know, if you know, if you know, this is the story story of your hundred as you know, what you know what you know what you know what you know what you know what you know what you know what you know what you know what you you know you know you --
No is something like a couple of a couple of a see."
One of example example of the world's first world's first first interesting -- my first internation.
But how I was about how to remember, I started this is that I started this is a foot is a sham is a sham is a sham is a slikely is a shappe,
Because in fact, this is the cells you if you know, the found: you get the found, you have a couple of the flots of the food-llly.

This is free to be a couple -- not not not not not -- but not not -- but it for the found.
But the foundation of a couple of a couple questions to ask as, and move to respone,
Thank you very much.
