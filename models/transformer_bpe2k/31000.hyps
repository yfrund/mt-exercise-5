Last year I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, which the pool, who had about the last three million years of the size of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the serious problem of this particular problebecause it doesn't show the dish of the ice.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a sense of the swood-heart system.
It set out in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showed is a accell version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is done in the red.
As you see, it out to dark blue.
That's the anniversary ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called offering ice, five years or older, is almost like flow-by-like flow-down here.
In 25 years, it's going to this in 25 years,
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Icell and there's a very large amount of carbon is frozen womer womer is frozen carbon is being being being boundly in meth,
Consider the total amount of dish in the atmosphere, that could double, that could double, that can double, that can double.
In some indeep inside in Alaska sign in Alaska sign of methane in the water.
And the last winter went win Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different deep to a different set to a different undeep to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a diet,
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is to whether we will be that.
A reason for that, this is that this huge warm-bron" Groenland from the north of the north warms.
This is a meltwo-atriver.
The water volume is echer larger than eye.
This is the Kanger-river-river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea so-sense is because the landia, this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These flow are taking flight.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Poole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And last month reported, scientists that the whole continent now that has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice in the West of the South Pole very quickly quickly at the meltilands.
The whole continent is to six meter sea soil -- just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of largest ice ice mass -- there are new now, who were still glaciers were still glaciers in the Himalaya,
40 percent of the world's population is gets half of his drink-water of that melds.
In the Anded, is this glier the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more flow-strom.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California there was a 40 percent in the snowwk of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are read.
This global dreaming has read to a dramatic stird of foresting forest.
And the number of nature, and the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen seeing speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours --
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east of the Stille Eastern from America, a's from America, and each side, and every single side, there is a drastic daling of Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic daling of the oceans.
The only big cause of the global warming, nearly deforestation, which is for 20 percent of the earth, is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest existers, together with China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon centers.
But we see a cirmess.
These are the coal-carbon carbon was annual that was annual number of alternatives were readed.
There's a political fightter of the gestuff in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industire gave in the 250 million dollars to promote "scal" and promoting a conversation of the support of engages.
And that image did something that was thinking about something that was thinking about something that was done to me think.
And the guy was at at the home, in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons of cool,
You probably seen it in the news of the news.
This is the one of the biggest dish of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the cotton the coton the Kerstind was this:
Video: "Frosty the coal guy is a happy of key is a guy.
He's considered in America, and he makes us to America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scanman is scone.
He's paid and scate, and employees like their job and employees their job."
Here's a big part of the coal in West Virginia froms.
The largest mines of the country is the great blays of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship me be, "Lake me be, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Red, Nancy Pelosi, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate-protection protection for two campaigns on the told of the gorges.
This is a piece of a piece of them.
Video "ALergy, COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our business.
That's why the reason the reason the most important goal is to give a giant engage to the light and reach the light and the detroled, and the detroled, of course the truth of stebond-carbon carbbobox.
Feit is, steencoal is not snow,
We find that the clean -- and it still lesson -- and it still lesson on --
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shan coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-coal-making centrale.
Fantastic! The machines are pretty much a little bit of a lay thing.
But that's the sound of clean coal coal technology.
And despite the fact that the branch of coal of one of the main causes of the global warming, the remarkable is shaped shoot shapes of the earth of global technology that you see all here.
Look around, this is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative in our economic challenges and that on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red is in all of these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel and imported oil.
But now there's a knew solution to get out of this.
For America of 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get the work of the work of a plan, that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth to.
Finally, a solution that depensive enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. It's the way to get to it.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Imagic, and re-energy.
One of the quicest ways to make a endless of our dependence of old fuel of old fuel of old fuel that our planet to help our planet to help the planet to help the so.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And then then you get 2: No investments to create good paid jobs.
Voicepower America. Time to become realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African old African and say, "If you want to be all there.
If you want to go far far with you."
We have to go far, and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am a for those who didn't waren't waren't waren't got the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever next, 27 kilometers in entertaining the engineer.
It has to be the circumstances that were being less than a billion less than a billions of second after the universe started to 600 million times a second times a second.
Enorm ambitius, so, so, so, so, so, so.
This is the machine Geneevil.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in arribbition that you can see the scale.
In 10 septee year we put the machine for the first time we put the first time.
This photo become by ATLAS.
That causes a partment in the controll,
It's a picture of the first particle jaesstral that all around the LHC went around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was going to be flowing particles in the detector of the detector of the detector of the detector of the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture in 10 September we knew that was working that the machine, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this got the biggest across or this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of the Internet page out of the Internet page.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientistic impact as a scientistic impact as a science of impact.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which was to do with these golden drames.
And those behaviors ago, 13 thousand ample when the machine working on full force.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they're superago, and they can be superago.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can be able to behaviors that stream.
In one of the connections between the nine of the nine in the LHC, was a constructive to the LHC, was a constructive.
It was going to be something warmer, and it was intended to be electrical resistance against that 13 thousand ample of cates.
This was the result.
This is more impressive when you realize that that the magnets are more than 20 tons to be more than 20 tons -- and they were going to put about 30 inches.
We shamed about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we do.
We all took them when they all touch them as all the time.
Now they're back on the way.
Eind will be intact.
We will invitate it again, and we expect measure in june or right so we can go further to figure out what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have started accidents the debate, reinflecting the value of scientific research.
I think the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to go beyond than the one of things like the LHC.
I showed the last words of the English scientist Humphray Davy, I had to do the decade of the value of the value of the value of his teacher, his learning was dangerous for the progress, "None's dangerous for the human mind of the human mind to take the human mind to take the human mind that there are not to take our images of science are not to take mysterious, and that there are not to discussinging that there are not a new world."
Thanks!
I would like to start asking to you back to your children back to your children played with blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it up, and they pull up and aware in the problems of the teacher and hands of space relationship with the debt of space relations.
And the Ruimtely insight is very strong considered understanding the world to us.
And if an information that inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- with objects -- with objects -- with my adviser Patch, and my compassion and my compassion -- what if we were going to ask -- what if we were going to use a computer that one computer that one computer would be a kind of digital finger to a plat desing with the hands of individuals with the information that we can deshape information with the information of information that can depensive information with the information of information with the neide of information of information of the ff of information of information that is -- -- -- -- -- -- --
and ordering order, as we want to do that?
This question him was so connected to figure out a single to look for a single by building Siftables.
Sort cooky is a Siftable computer in the size of a cooky computer in size of a cooky computer in the size of a cooky.
They can be moved, they can put together them together to feel their movement detect and they contain a screen and wireless contact.
The point is the physical handle-blocks can be put on the physical act, they can be moved by it.
And the top dies are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is that these helptic different, more physical different, are conscious of their movement, and even from the way we move them, there are different new and so many of the interactions of the way we move them to discover them.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is inslum to tell a video that is playing by the election of the cell plays and others:
This interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians as to each other other together, they will be interest to interest in the same thing.
If they are surround, they can also notice this and what can become a little bit of nervous weight.
And then they feel movement, and helling.
We realized algaug that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of everyday is the use of the insingle of the insultions of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of this interaction of the interaction,
In this example of three Siftables emmers to be to be able to use them to go color in a very empty in the good.
If we have threat, we went back to the back of the back.
There are some cut possibilities for the education, explaining game playing, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to prove things quickly incencentivity to see the outside of the immediately, immediately good.
So here's what I -- this is the development of a Fibonacces by a simple accell programative --
Here's a game that a cross that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle, you get around in any set around a randomly literally get on every Siftable, and sense words are controlled in a dictionary.
And then in about 30 seconds is rescue that rescue a new series of letters with examples.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I became out in the Media Lab, and I would try to make it and make a video of it.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost not need instructions of the most interesting thing to have instructions of this applications of the most interesting things of this applications of this application of this application of the most interesting things of this applications of the most interesting things that are needs almost interesting things of this is that people
All you have to say is "Most word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people test the test of the test of the other people test
That's our youngest ber bider both of the bottom of the one.
And it turns out that he only was the Siftables would.
For him was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstry.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that character's Siftask with that character of the table.
Here's he let the sun emerged to get the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God dy! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the nearly of Siftables and the nearly he can respond to each each each -- Video: Wak the nearly of the cards!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decided how it past.
Video: The cattle is away.
DM: The last example I will show you today Is a synthesizer and live music child is a synthesizer and live a sound produces a sound produces a sound of sound and pressure and pressure and pressure and pressure of the drum.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the very very injected so you can determined the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the living in the lege of the patter
You put a sound in the pattern by the decade of a very sound of a very very very likely effects like reverb and filter.
They're going to be able to be sound and adapted by the sound of the sound of the sound
And then then you can be the general effects like tempo and volume that are being added on the entire pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern by an extra first pattern by an extra lead.
And now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now, I add a little bit.
Video: And now I copy the movie on the prins, so I can affect the effect lives.
Video: DM: I can spend it very acceling through the bottom of the call.
Video: DM: Now, I copy the filter of the bas for the philter of the bas for expression.
Video: I can reach the pattern as it playing.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything to be very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and make it very longer and shorter as I want to be very longer and make the very longer and make the very longer and shor
With the dimms of the dimms of the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to the left of the volume Siftile to the left of the dimms of the dimes.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is going to make new human-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better dested in the way our brains and bodied in the way our brains and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we developed in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that is only the atsize is the attention to a very new generation to the interact with digital media, which bringing the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it out to you with all of you all to talk to you.
I'm writing.
Books write my work, but also writing so much more than that.
My whole life long I've been doing writing already and I don't think that's changing going to change
And yet there is something that happened in my life and career in my life, and career with my work and career with my work with my work and re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-long as well.
It started with a book that I write written a memoire: "Et, Biddy, a memoire: Beminnera -- that very very very contradiction to my first work.
The consequence is that people have to go all over and always told me as if I do do job and fortun.
And so that -- gets invite!
People come to me and ask to me and ask ask you don't afraid you will never be scare?
Are you going to be scared your whole life will be write to write a book that people are going to write a book that people for warm.
Are you not afraid ford?"
Erg disgusting you know.
Of course, that would be very very matter that I remember in 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I told you I was going to become a decades I wanted to become a writer.
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Do you don't get afraid to be afraid you'll be supposed to you?
Do you don't afraid your life on this work without saying without there is a little bit of your broken on the puin of your broken bitter of your broken bitter-bitter-axis of bitter?"
Something in that streting.
In the short comes my answer to ask on this saying, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called
Althe time of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know what everything to be everyone to know what it is.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what I write is writing myself the last time that come from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is being an eight to be an eight for the work for the work for their opinion to their opinion on Earth are see?
What is so particular to creative processes that we make sure that we make us to the effects of the mindnesipality, something that happens to be something that happens to be not going to happen.
Take my father. He was chemistry, and I can't remember that there was a chemistry, and I can't remember someone ever asked someone ever asked if he was not afraid to him that was not afraid to be there for it.
And so, "John, how is it to your chemblock?"
No, no, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been by the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of reputation for piece of manically, malcoholists.
Scheately, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writer, also other creative people have turned out to be instable, instable, instable, instable.
And look at the grimy death the most magnificant death the most magnificance of the 20th century.
Many died young by own slide by own own slipped.
And even those who don't seem to be suicide to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be a suicide of their gave town,
In the last interview for his death said, "Do said "Say each of my books is a piece of mitrself disastine."
That's quite a bit to say about your lifest.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at that.
We all heard it all earlier and have heard it with my all accepted.
The reason the idea is that creativity is that creativity innecessarily is going to lead with suffering and finally an artist-existing to missing the equivalent to missing the same thing to missing is to read to the suffer.
So I want to ask everyone here today, you can live with that notion of living to be living with that idea living to be a living to ask everyone here today, can you have a life?
Find you do that OK?
Because I think I think I think about it, I think it's not a very good thought.
I think it was very weather to be able to be the resistance.
And even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is so this century as well.
We can spore creative mind to be more than to live in the way to live and life.
I know it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous, to that dark in the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of my mind,
In fact, the so, the phase where my career now.
Go tune too, I am a saying year.
I can spend four decades in front of decades.
Hopemal probably everything I now will be putting in the outside of the outside world, as the work that extraordinary book successful book.
We are here with friends under each other, so I can explain you -- it's probably my biggest success is my biggest success already for behind me.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think about this is what you are the o'clock to the neine for neine in the front of the derank.
So I don't want to be not.
I love to the work I love to the work I like like that.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just go through write with write as I can just go through the process inside the process inside the process inside the process inside the process.
I have to write the write of a safe distance between myself and my convert and my considered very very understanding of the response of my future published publications.
I did it last year in the last year to ways to do that.
I am in history, and I do it in other societies and reach in other civilizations to see or others to help or others to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search has brought me in the old Greek and Roman and Romerow
Let me have a long and complicated story.
In the old Greek and Romewood and Romols didn't have that creativity was from hengineering was from hengineering of themselves.
And I believed that creativity was a divity a divity of mine, which of a dish to the human beings -- to the human beings -- to be unknown for failure.
The Greeks called this calls of creativity "demonently.
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that influistered him words of influistered him to refluistered him the words of influistered him to influistered.
The Romomestic had a kind of same idea.
In them was called them a "genious mind creative mind creative minds.
The funny is that the Romomb with a genius not a very pience pience.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical goddless entitt that was held in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the house there.
If the artistic was working was the genius assistentirely assion --
And he gave form to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first thing about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work
The artistic was taken in protection to be in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you're working on the work was brilliant won't get all the honor for that.
Everybody knew that an invisible, which was invisible.
Where's the work was crazy, that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent.
Lange time is that the West creativity was considered to be considered to be considered
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was changed
There was a very new idea: the individual human idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, sentencement, from the godle-sent world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual preventing.
And for the first time in history, there was a genius about artists said they were a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius were not going to be a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a geniused.
I have to say I have to say that a big wrong in the way.
To let me believe that he is to believe that he or she or she is whether she is whether she is the essential, the essential, the essentially, creative and known force to be a lot of responsibility to a fragile human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun into swallowed to swallow the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun in the sun.
Ego's become expectantic proportions, and there are incredible expectations to prestently prestations to prestations to prestations to prestations to prestate the expectations to be resolved to expect proportions.
And I think this pressure has made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists
If that's so on, and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return back on an older understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can not make 500 years, we can rational humanisn't undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes speech.
Probably in the audience people who have removed scientific doubt about the idea that elphysical creatures with some of faces with some feet of artists of artists to inspiring high-to-inspiring high-to-artists.
It doesn't seem like I will get you all in the way that I will get you in there.
And yet I wrong it down.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought not to do that though?
It just squeeds as much as wood as much as all the other explanations of totally incalculation that are decided in the creative process.
Everybody who have to try to create something -- so in fact, all the considering of the -- you know that the creative process doesn't always rational behave.
And that sometimes it feeling the paranormny.
I have the wonderful American closer American closer to the great American closer to the amazing American animals.
And she's thick in the nine. Her all life already writing poems.
She told me about her childhood on the plattempt of Virginia.
Some she was in the field of the work was felt at the work was felt to the country.
It was so saying she said, as if there was a big wave air came air
And so that you can get poem about the country.
She felt that the ground, and she was beginning to shake her at that moment and her her at that point, and one thing is to her life.
And she ran home, back home, and she had to do the paper and they had to do it and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper to paper and paper and they had to do it as quickly as soon as quickly to get the paper and then paper to the paper and then they had to see pac
When it came close by her hand her her hand her only was her only possibility to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then sokay, but cut the house doesn't go home.
And at these moments the poem of her him, disappearing in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And then there were a lot of the -- I think I think it's beautiful part of the story -- they almost beautiful part of the poem --
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper and paper and shapes the paper by her him.
Just at that point she had a pencouraged to take a pencourage of the one-potled.
And with her other hand, so she told me she told me and set it out of the air.
She pulled it close to his tail back in her body, and it back into her body, as she wrote it back into her body,
And in that cases came up with the poem of well-well-paper in the paper, but then in forever.
When I think -- I thought I think -- what is happen, I thought that is so explore my creative process!
This is what my creative process, not! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which every day every day on the same time on the same time of the whose on the same time and transformed with blood, sh and transform.
But even in that daily swrately I've had a such a experience.
You will also know it yourself to know that there are creative ideas in your record, you can identify impossible.
What is that it for bround?
How can we use it without getting that we become that without the one?
And somehow well.
The best contemporaine example I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
I interviewed it for a magazine, I was a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is a very large part of his life has been shown in the shows of the contemporary of the contemporary artists that are trying to get on the infar, in the unconservable creative impulses in him.
And the '0s, Tom a little bit more restier.
And one day he reached in Los Angeles about the flow-aways, and changed the process process of radical.
And as he got so he heard a clip of a melodie.
The decided that makes him, like inspiration that does insipe, disgusting --
It was a beautiful melosad and he wanted to fashion the wrong of the way.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper -- no packs, no taneously at the time.
The well-known excited, and then the meloy of the meloy of the melodie, and then it stays me behind the century backwards.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't get a whole mental process and did something new.
he looked at the air and said, "Sorry hear, don't you see that I sat behind the sense I sat the sentence.
"Do you really think I can write a song to write a song?
If you really want this song of songle to be there, you have to add when I have time for you've got time for you.
And not, you know, somebody else los.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And then then the time the process of course, very different.
The work is the same thing to the same dark is the dark of the such of the supposed to the dark is even the dark of the dark itself,
But the heavy that the creative process of creative process in him expensive distance of the genius.
The genius was going to be on the skin and proved only but it was a selling out.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go on the bottom of it.
It could be an amaz, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the propertile of Tom and the propertile of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working changed in the story.
I had been profit of profit of it.
I was in the middle of the Et, Biddy, the middle of Ets, Biddoms.
I point away I point in despase.
You know that you don't want to be working well, and you think it's a terrible disaster disappoint. The bad book.
Not just slightly bad -- really horrible bad bad bad and it's not a very rigerate.
I wanted to do it all the project.
And then I remember Tom that was going to his genius, and I decided to be a point of the way.
I went, I went, from my manuscrips and direct me to a very very much of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know everything that if this book doesn't only be brilliant is not only by me.
You can see that I have all the way in what I have in my thing.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better, you have to get your thing to get to your thing.
Snaked? Do you don't do that, you'll be thank you.
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notile is being being seen to be a single on office."
Tja--- Ush -- it's going to be in the notice of the
Eeuwen came up in the North African desert African desert of people to dear with malight on the malight of sacred music.
Uren and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always amazing, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes happened to be something extraordinary happened to be a very extraordinarily --
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you have ever seen with that, you've ever seen something in a performer.
It was like the time stillustrated and the dance of the past.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I have all the set together.
And he didn't like a human beings just a human being.
In him, under him of him blown it.
A goddly free him.
And if something happened to be something like that, knew people what it was started to clap them to clap and clap it and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historic fact, when the Moren South South South Spainting them to do this usual lim with them.
The spot is echer by the centuries of the centuries of "Allah," Allah."
And you hear the day in the day of flaments and flaments and flaments and flamengoance.
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magic, you know, it is a single to say, "Allah, oil -- well, Allah, amazing -- well, well, well, you know, well, well."
At resemble, disease of God.
And the recipe we need to have.
Lasty is the dance is that the dance of the dance of morning in the under of the under day to be 11 in the morning,
And then at that points to be a little parentling guy with extremely well.
Maybe there will never be somebody God will never attack in dance.
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
And that's really hard to sell a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be so painful how it doesn't have to be like that.
Imagine that you don't go from the most extending of your person aspects of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person from your person
Imagine you believe that you have a while, you know, to specified to specified source of a source source.
When you get ready with it, they become them on someone else.
This is how it considered everything.
I have invented invention that thought to be thought to be thought to be in the average
And the last months I worked on a book that will be short short. The book, where a lot of recently looking at is excited.
The opollowed of that illuster progress.
And if my mind to the hall, I walk up the same one, I still like to be the same answer.
Do you work to work.
So you just do thing you do thing, whatever it is.
If you have task to dance you, thank you to dance you,
If the goddly genius is admitted to decide in your work at some point at some point at some point at some of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the divical source of divice."
And not exchange that not, thank you all the time.
And then "Oly!"
I believe that I believe that I believe that I think it's hard.
"Oh w!" because we have a pure human love and propertly, human love and propertile by staying by ploes of the pure of paths.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Or!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what it can mean and what it can mean, and the discovering of new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the biology to the biology and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology of the biology and synthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something I think that have tried to understand it in different levels to understand the different levels of levels have tried to understand it in different levels.
We tried different approaches and bring into minimal components.
We are nearly 20 years to the digity;
When we have the human genome genome we sequenced from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask to ask life to regenerate new, or can we create new, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organm, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of genius for a kind of that can conmultiply in a laboratorium.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature smaller genome can be able to be a nature smaller.
We can go to the order of hundred of them out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical ma, is that relatively relatively requires with the onze.
And you can get me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check a piece of equivalent that this would be a living cell cell.
And we decided that the only route conditions was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we started a chromosome of the synthetis?"
Stay the chemistry to make this very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome "restart?"
A chromosome is but a piece of chemically, but a piece of chemically, a piece of chemical.
So, our single the digitalizing of life is accelerated on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather rather slose of slose of slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code of the ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code as a slose of the gen
And our last point it would put in a moment in an exponential curve.
We're starting to be able to get over over over 15 years ago
There were some stages for a couple of stages for a bio-ethic ethic ethic ethic access.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the things are going to be there.
So we had to make a new method for the collaborate of these little pieces of all the errigate of all the errigate of all the errigerate of all the errigate of the errigate of the mistakes.
And this was our first pogon, we start with the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria deate.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the wrong --
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning of the stuff in the bacteria chemician in the bacteria genetic code of the genetic code of gges.
The viral particles were going to be walked out of the cells, they came back and killed back and deaths the E. coli.
I was speaking with the oil industry, and I said that they were going to be able to well.
They laughing more than you.
So we think this situation is a situation where the software can build its own hardware building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in the size of viruses, so we could variety of the cassettes --
to understand what the deeply components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than to have to be very accuraat.
When we first first this genome for the first time in 1995 was the standard exactly one ercision was one both per 10,000 basepares.
And then finally, we found after resequencing 30 pirl. If we had the original sequence than it was not able to start.
More of the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be able to consult with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can get to build so that they can design together.
We design unique parts in the unique of the unique of the unique of designs here.
Maybe you read that we put water marks in the watermarks in the watermarks.
Bethink: we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, CG.
Trios of that code letters for ruwway, 20 aminozurs -- that there's an amazing inoxyoxyoxyoxyoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write the genetic code to write the genetic code to be thinking.
At inforces we just set down,
Some of them were disappointed that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces of these pieces of enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairs and put together.
And we started to make pieces of the pieces of sangles that were five to 7,000 letters long, only only only set of 24,000 letters, take a 2,000.
In any stage of week we got a flooring of these pieces so that we could sequences them because we want to create a process of a process -- that will be very robuust -- you see you are going to see the street --
We try to achieve the point of automatished to achieve it.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow as easily more in E.
That explains the expanding of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-repairs called by repairs to repairs to repairs and repairs together.
Here's an example of that.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiation to be on the side.
And you can see that in the top panel, shem is just slightly sopm just out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it back into the each other, exactly as it was first exactly like the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dried up to be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacum.
I know absolutely absolutely can be able to move for, that can be able to move a new aquatickly environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of us here are many of them here.
Here's a deeply microphto from the molecule that we've made with these processes -- actually actually with these processes -- actually actually with these processes with the right design of the pieces of the pieces that we did in the stuff that we in the stuff that we did in the death,
And it took that she automatically invice.
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, taken about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we spent unrolling inside the one-long time.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code to the genetic code down.
Now, how do we started a chromosome chromosome of it?
And then a virus is clearly pretty easy.
And then a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simply if you give up under eukaryots, like us, you just wheeling the cell and do another in, and it is what you know when you do it is what you know when you do it was reading.
In the bacteria species of the bacteria chromosome of the cell, but we have to show that we have a complete transplantation of a chromosome, and we can split from a cell transplantation of a cell to a other, and can activate the activity.
We have a chromosome of a micro-in-sophisticated from a microbs.
These are about so far from each other as people and muizing.
We added some extra gene so that we could select this chromosome of this chromosome of the extra
We retemporary it with and, and make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make piece.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be able to value the very advanced graphical images here -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to set up to so, but we tried to develop the process of what to do is what to do is going to be able to develop the process of what to do is going to be further to be to develop.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all kinds of explore that have a second chromosome of them or a thousands or a thousands of character in one times, which they add thousands of character in one times.
People that evolves evolving as if there are one changes that have not been much biology.
There are enzymes that restriction and enzymes that are actually engineering DNA that actually providing DNA
The chromosome was not a cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stop -- well, we put it in it --
It became expression, and the recognize the other chromosome of chromosome of the material, and so we finally had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because of the genes that we put in it in it
And in very short time disappeared from the one species of the ene species of the new species of software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell.
All proteins changed the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was changed in which it changed was changed.
This is a monkey as genomic, but we're straight in the way by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Already before that this is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is a propulling -- this is the previous of 3.5 billion years evolution, and I pay that we may almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of new species of degree on this digital design in this digital design on this digital design of this digital design explosion of this digital design is not a new version of degreeater --
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what you needed is needed to what it take.
We're going to go insoon from six-and-a-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 1946, that there are four in 40 years,
We have to have food with food, with the dish of clean water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's going to be hard to do that for new.
We use five billion tons of college tons of collapsed at five billion tons
That's 100 miloons of fat.
When we take biological processes in ogence or what process process than any of what process is to replace, that is going to be a huge challenge.
And of course, all that carbon dioxide of the dioxide that comes in the atmosphere.
And by the world's discoveries we have a databaase with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that have come out of there.
We are precedented by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques that they cut quick market methods to do so-called combination genomics to do "combination genomics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing processes to produce or drugs to produce or drugs to produce or drugs to change the molecular biology than in the last 20 years, then we can change the molecular biology than in the last 20 years, of the science than in the last 20 years,
And it's only standard selection.
We can select select for life-far, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, vaccess, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design software where we work, so you can really go on the gang and can actually go on the computer and a new kind of on the computer of computer.
We don't know how it will see it out.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code of the genetic code of their genetic code out of the genetic code of their genetic code out of it.
We focus on fourth generation of fuel today.
And the same thing that are going to be ethanol to be a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of soon, like sugar, to more high-digiter fuel of fuel like sugardens or different fuel of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price higher and the available to reduce is when we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are food to design that we are able to design that can do it in that way, and think we do the first fourth generation of the first generation generation of the first generation of 18 months in about 18 months of months to have the first generation of months to have the first way to be high.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but by our global discoveries --
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea, about 2.5 miles deep in the depth of temperature --
It makes methane of CO2 with the help of molecular hydrogen as energy source as energy source.
We are looking at whether we can take CO2 and we can be able to be able to be able to factories in the factories that CO2 is returned to be returned to be returned to the fuel to send this process.
So in a short while we think we're able to think we're able to expanding out the basic question: "What is life?"
We actually have realized -- the protect of the protect petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where you can do this at TED
A important energy source of energy source of energy source
But we're also working on the use of these tools to think about quickly servaccines to think about quickly --
This year there was the flu -- we always walked just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the tempt of forward vaccines.
Here's how the future can see the future can change the evolution tree, the evolution tree, the evolution of synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota, and finally eukaryota.
We are still removed from people.
Our goal is to be able to survive that we make a chance to survive long, to do that probability to do that probably you well.
What I want to show you as a little bit quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to bring you to go to Microsoft a year ago.
And it's a environment in which you locally or at the distance with immense amounts of data can work with visual data can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images, and can stay here in the endline and challenge and exploded the sorts of our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the biggers or images.
Most of this normal camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 meapixel of the 300 meapixel of the 300 megapixel of the Lixel of the Library of the Library of Congress, but this is
It all makes nothing out because it only thing that would affect the prestations would affect on a system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Each column,
To prove that it's really text, and not really imagination, and not do something -- to show you something that is really text, to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a very e-book way to read a e-book to read a e-book a e-book to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a very e-book way to read a very e-book of a book way to read
I wouldn't be adoperation.
This is a realistic example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a submitted of a support.
This is really gives you really pleasure and the experience of a real paper of papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have done something that was done with the corner of the Guardian
We made a nice advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the abilities of this car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make it to make sure that we can do the constraints of hands through the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the ideas can really do the screen of the screen of the constraints of the constraints of the constraints of the screen of the screen of the cells of the conconstrainclu
We hope that this doesn't mean that means that this means and other suddenly flawwwking, not need to be more popular flawwke.
Of course are amaps a crule for the way of course is a technology like these, I will not spend here at the time, except that we can also spend up to this field that we can be able to be able to this field to this field to.
This is all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of a image of the NASA's NASA's
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connects two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer-vision by Noah Snavely, promoderly to the University of Washington, ago from Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible.
When we do this, you see this -- you can experience the images and experience the ces and experience the multi-resolution.
The space shake of the images has meaning of the images.
The computer vision algorithms have these images, so they have refrigorithms with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomes of elected diashostabilized diashot diashostability to be diassions are space and all these things are space --
I don't know if there is a time or there is another environments.
There are more space that there are more more space than it is that there are more space.
I want to like one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in this summer, which is the communicate what I have in my head, the realm of these techniques of the environments of this techniques on our website.
We had to keep account with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for the Notre in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and so on.
And each of these orange chests given a image again, which is a image again.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are spending in this way of copied to be copied by the way,
And we can be able to easy at a simple way as a way of easy.
You know, I had never thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft would work.
It's overwhelming to be so unfortune to be so unfortun.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras -- all of gsm to mirrors to mirrors a lot of of it, consider, a great number of thing, including in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so many works and so many works and things like that.
And somewhere between the photographs -- here are they -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is cheatracted by the program.
If we have the poster in the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we really want to do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- from the entire collective memory of how to see it -- and the Earth is looking.
All these pictures are being conducted with each other and shapes a very bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth --
So this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Ath.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it to use the provide of the people who use it.
Their own photos are being being able to be a bunch of metape data that somebody else.
If somebody all of these heavy would like to get them and their names and invet, my photographs to the Notre Dame is requires that data, and I can use a access to the space, that metape uses of every photographs, and created a kind of cross model, and created social experience.
And of course, it's be-product of this immense rich virtual model of any internal model of any interesting place on Earth, who not only only from air, satellite images, satellite imagery is defined from the collectively -- and it will be a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand that what makes your software, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are being dealed by everyone in the world can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered is discovering.
It creates your wishh, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based of the data in the data in the images.
And that's being received when you think about the richchchchales of semantic information that are available information that are available to be awful about that images across the wealth of these images are exciting about the power of semantic information that are available to be aware of semantic information that is being being defined by the richchchchched of semantic information that is available to be exciting from the riching of semantimes.
When you look for images, you find a searching of a search in the webig, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image is going to be the image of information about what the image is going to be able to imagine the image of information about what the image is going to be able to imagine, and the text.
What if you copied imaged is to all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth rich that comes out of that. It's a classic networking effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and of evily is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live between those who are not forgetting the old living in the wind, the point in the wind, the point in the profits, the profitting bitters.

Samen forms the intelliligives in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and cultural life is as important as the biological life webb: the biosphere.
This cultural life web is a scaring of the enosphere is a front of the equipment of eat.
The foot of equivalent to define as the totally of all the thoughts of all the thoughts of all the thoughts, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are previous imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The foot is the big nalature is the big nality.
She's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as amazing newsh and all that we can be newsh animals that we can be able to be newsh animpact.
You know, like the biosphere is the foot is the foot is that equivalent -- and still in much larger mate.
No biologist, would be able to be confront that least half of all species on the point of extinction of extinction is not true.
And the most optic scenario scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is the losing of this is the loss.
When everyone was born born in the early of the early explore of talks on Earth was born on Earth.
A language is more than her word-scate or her grammmatical rules.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the vehicle that the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is an age-old old old old an age-old an ecosystem to spiritual an ecosystem to spiritual opportunities.
From that six-thousand becomes more in today the day of not more in children today.
They're not longer tell.

Is there something like to be amazing through the lesson, the last of your people, the last of your people, no chance to speak to spend the ancestors of the ancestors of the kids have to see the reward?
And reciiide that tergene is the demands of the Earth, because every two weeks and dying it was an older and dying the last letter of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, don't have the world better place, if we all all the same language of the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantone. Or Kantone: Or Kantone:
Or Kogi.' You will realize how it could not be able to talk to you to talk to to your own language.
So what I want to do today is what I want to do is a short journey by the etno.
And many of us forgotten that when I talk about it a different way of being in a different way of mindset of our minds.
Take this Barasana-child in the North Amazone, the people, the people who believe that she believes from the anaconda, that she is powerful from the eye of the anaconda, in the buy of heavy snaky snake.

The living bars the mines of mind.
The minds can be able to be involved from the Great Water, the dancing of the Drace that the soul of the living times, so that in the soul of the path, so that when the god.
And so that is why they are going to be living to the church and talk about God.

That's how it is eally. It's ed. It's very beautiful to protect this too protect to the older brothers.
And in fact, we are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the world.
And the point is going to be intuitiveael very important.
If we think about inheemsacious and landscape, we often Rousase and the old factor, and the old factor, a idea that racistic in his simplicity in his simplicity.
Or we took stories Thoreau and say that these people's closer to the Earth state than us.

Or it the life's living of a mind or a lot of it is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines the defines of the individuals and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to become a consever.

These minds are important during their Hamatsa-inducation.
If you start to get the idea that these cultures can be able to create different realities can be able to get a number of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant.
It's a picture I april that I have to do you in the North Amazon nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating is so fascinating is not just the farmacological potentially to it, but how farmacological potentially it is built out of two sources.
Enerze, there is a wood-carboline, harmine and harm and harmaline in heart and harmaline in the hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating carbon and harmalinating hallucket halluce-sil, and harmingly holar-maline heart --
If you take the plant, it seems to it that a blue requality by your consciousness.
The plant is being mixture with blowing of a coffee behind Psychotria vible Psychotria vible psychotria vial redis.
The plant trying, powerful tryptamines, nauthority to brain serotonine, dimethyltry-methoxyltrydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethylitry-ptaminy ptaminy ptaminy ptamines,
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they have snut, that substance of different species that substance of different species that methoxyltryptamine containing methyptami ptami ptoom --
That powder your nose in bladses, as from a memoria, and detected with barokay, to be able to be in a sea of electricity. This is not deform of reality; it does not be distorted from reality of reality of reality of reality of reality
I tried to convince my professor, Richard Evan Shultants -- a man who did the psychedicic aged in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryes didn't have to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect is intricity involved in the effect is intricize the home, no more home, to experience the hallucination are not ornal, because they are deeply from their effect in the human dominal -- because they are deeply died by a single oxiamine oxiday.
They can only be orally being taken in the smoke of sunit to be sun.
The fascinating is that the beta-carbolines in the glow-suppressure suppressure suppressure to activate the tryptamine of the tryptamine of 80,000 plants of two morphological intinctions of two morphological intons of the bigger of the parts that are large of the greater than the shapes that are larger than the shape of the parts of the parts of parts of parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the larlargele that are that are that are that are that are that are that are that are that are larlarged larlar
We say eufemistic "trial and there are a sense of it, as a meaningle-mask.
The Indians saying, "The plants talk to us. What does does mean? This stem mean? This tribe, the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuas well, they can identify all the big distance in our eyes would be a kind of money.
If you take their question to how they put their taxonomy their taxonomy in the way of plants.
You know, you all notice not?" I said, "no."
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night in a night in different toird in different toird of sings.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book-bunch of power.
Now, the problem is even the problem is even those of the sympathic people, incorporate to inecemsacious and color and color and colorful to a foot in the history of the real world, meaning our world, means of our world, meaning our world, by the real world, meaning our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember of 300 years to be reminded to be a war, or his technological innovations, but earlier as the era in which we were in it, and active participipes or passed to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem isn't change.
All cultures always have shared in a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology on is not the problem isn't the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux and then they gave their pile, and the bottom as that Americans stopped to be Americans to be in Americans to be and ways.
It's not changing or technology that integrity of the foot of the foot of the front of the front of the front of the foot of the foot of the foot of the front of the foot of the foot of the front of the integrity of technology that integrity of the front.
It was writing the government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappear.

In the case of the Yanomami are the diseases that are involved as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genoccasion, the physical excise of a people, but enocy, etnocide, the destruction of the life-like the destruction of a people, is not only being being being a part of a development, but in many areas of a part of a development.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level on the basic level level in touch of the basic level.
I have a young colleague in West-China to reach in the Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then I started in Lhasa came in Lhasa behind the statistics where you hear about it.

And one day she stacked a day sound on a poorest of Mao. For this overtold seven years of desperatisished to seven years as well.
The pain of Tibet can be intentially involved to be involved to free your foot is something to be free to your flake.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of a single world of inforce or do we want a color of diversity in the world of diversity?
The big anthropologist, Margaret Mead said to her death that we directioned that we directioned that we can provide a general image of cut move.
We would not only see the human imagination is constrained to a small model, but also we would have been going to be expected and forgotten that there are other options existence.
We can feel like our kind of argue that our kind of around, about [15,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitic Revolution, which we gave gave our agriculture to the cult of the seed of the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the proza by the proza specialization of the pries' and we got a demonstration by specialization of the dish of the Neolitic Revolution, just 10,000 years ago from the shaman of the seed of the shaman of the shaman of the shaman of the shaman of the
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years.
This surface history that we have not given the idea that we have all the answers to all the question of all the question of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelliligives of the world to meaning of humans are being asked to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we will discover again that we will discover the potential to be what we're going to be a people, which is all the people, and all the gards and all the gards to be able to be able to flower.
This picture I have taken in the north point of Baffin Island taking up with Inextently narwal to be hundred to be hundred to be at narrow you.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inexcited. In the 1950s were put our sovereigntons of our sover, in the 1950s to followed in the 1950s of the 1950s were put in the 1950s were put in the 1950s were put in the 1950s were put in the 1950s were put in the 1950s for the '50s to the Inexcitement,
The one of Olayuk the ones of Olayers.
The family peace for his life and met him already him already his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the col; they use it to use it.
The glisters of their bears were made from their bbook in the cbooking.
Olayuks up was not afraid for the police or the storm that was highly for the him that wind the winm that wind
He went out, he was going to be able to get his breeding skin, and poepoep, and then the poep began to women, he shaped it as a limmet.
He brought a low-source speekings on the sides of the sides.
When it was solid, he was solid to be a dog with it.
He met the dog and improvised a harnames and improvise a harnahs.
From the ribbitch he made a bad one.
And he was looking for a dog in the neighborhood flake, including including poems.
And this is going around with nothing about it in many ways, in many ways, state symbol for the Wather the Interin and all the income and all the insemian engineering in the world.
In april 1999 gave the Canadian government the Interminial controlling back from a piece of country greater than California and Tas saming new home.
It's independent. They remembering all the ground of independent.
It's an example of how a nation enough example of how a nation can block to her people can block her people.
And finally, I think it's clearly to this highly at least for whose to these high-hurt -- they actually don't get away to this is not all away.
They're somebody's home.
They are going to be from the human imagination, which goes back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, are going to be the dreams of these children, just like the one, part of a lot of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extended to be reaching the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convinced but we believe that stories can change the world, which we probably the best tellers are the best tellers in the world, we probably are 35 million times a month, 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on TV and our magazining public.
We make a felt to travel to the enospher equivalent to the public, to such a very extraordinary culture, where the tune of the anthing, so hopefully any the most important bar, so hopefully the anthropology will be able to existence in a variety of exist, that this world is going to be able to live in a multiply and plumulticultiply plannment,
where all the people, can be contribute to our semental to our consult well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about talk to you about a few question that I have a book in a book of the book of the book of the book of the book of the question that I have a book of the question that I have a book of the question that I have a book of the question that I have a book of the question that I have a book of the
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some sense that you may have a degree you may have been told you may have a degree to explain a detained to explain a well.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all Westery, invitiated society.
And that official dogma luids like that, "Om the well-to-single level of our citizens on the highest level of them as many individual freedom of them as much individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, essential part of the human existence.
And the top dies of freedom is able to acting to engage a higher well-to-become a higher well.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like that people have freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-of-freedomatically means automatically means automatically means automatically means automatically means more well-well-of-freedom means more freedom means more freedom means more freedom mean
This is so deeply become so deep in our society that nobody would be durvil.
And in our living, this dogma step require.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A resource great.
Even about dressings.
And at the 175 similar bulling threatening in my supermarket tiny phoil and tw-virgin oli phoil and twal--engineering balance balances are getting in my supermarply --
And you can make task to make a bunch of your own threat, for the case between 175 species for you, nothing to you.
So that's the atbottle of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can put your stareoset your stareoset of them -- loudspeakers, casple casure, casure.
And in the one electronicawink's only source of this attackages.
You can be six and a half million different systems, with parts of parts of the store.
Five -- you have a lot of choic.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for young for you could all be asking all sorts of phone services only at Ma Bell.
You hurt the device. You don't bought it.
That had the way the advantage that it never piece of go.
And that time is forest for that.
In fact, there are a lot of different devices.
Especifically in cell phones is immenso.
This is the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player, neushigh-salt single bringing other.
And you don't have seen this model in the store, but you can certainly be seen that happens to be soon that happens to be soon that happens to be soon that happens.
The consequenc: people come to the store and assume ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No, no.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that not too much does not do too much does.
And in aspects of life, that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, is this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth care, it's in the U.S. inmiddle inmiddle of the way you go to the doctor, and you tell tell what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A to do or But, or we can do B
And a case and distributed this forward.
And then the one of these fores and ass?"
And you say, "Dokter."
And the doctor says, "A has this forward and then the first one of these forward and then took this forward.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you tell."
And we call that "own inbringing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decisions of decisions of someone with a condition of someone who are definitely disease, somebody who is free definitely disease, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient. For on recipments are being made a lot of advertising of advances are much advertising become much more advertising is being made a lot of additioning -- the best concondition of the pativicions of inclumative is is -- -- --
And you can't buy it beat somewhere on the goal's group, you can't buy and I cannot buy to buy them.
Why do do it reclabs, if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think that we are going to ask our doctor, to ask that other notion to ask that other notion of the engine.
Our identity yet a price, equipy aspect of us existing to choices like you can see on this slide of choices like this slide.
Our identity is of our identity,
We find ourselves, and so often we like.
Every morning to the emerge of the emerge you have to think about what person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that freedom everybody out of it was automatically from the way that you can be able to children are so quickly as quickly to children beginning.
The only reality was the only choice was who was not when and what you did was doing it.
Now, free everything for the opportunity to get up.
I teach an intelligent students, which I have done -- I have done less househigh-work.
They don't have a single or air than in the early time in the early time in the early time.
No, they have it to make choices.
"Am I says, whether now? I now marries now?
Or will I wait? I first children, or do I first children, or a career or a career of care?"
These are all set of questions.
They go through them to answer them to answer them, if this means that they don't have their houses, and by no good catch for fer and not a good catch for fer.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we come to work in work. Carl just already that technology telling us to work every minute of everyone day -- except in the Rolph Hotelph Hotelph Hotelph Hotelph Hotel.
There's one place, by the way, which I love mead, where Wido.
I don't think I think because I want to keep it for myself.
But good, which enormous choicy choices of work in that we are wondering, whether we're going to work on the time, or not.
We can look at a football dinner of our son's son, with us on the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side,
And even if they're all out of the things that are we all of that we have all the way of ask with all sorts of questions: "Am I responsidence?
Am I response this emailing email, I write this letter?"
And even as the answer is, we experience the football weightly-fighting our son in a very different way.
And what we look at at the great, the small, materialistic things -- life styl: life styl: life styling is a choos;
This is the world used to look at the world used to be saw it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is well, so I'm going to talk about what is is bad to talk about it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings on the human being.
A very contradiction is that the earlier paralyzing is that the earlier.
And so many choices find people the lots of choice.
I give you a very dramatic, example, a research to investments in volunteer plans.
A college of me got access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a great policy policy-in-transformed with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 founds.
They found that for every 10 policy police, that for every 10 policy that the working on the working on the took two percent took two percent of the death,
In five ve farmed five percent less employees than five percent less employees than five than five than five and less employees in five and less employees in five than five and less less employees than five than five and less employed,
Because it in fifth of fifth is so hard to choose that people just exposed to the next day, and it was just going to the next day, and that people just like this, and so forth -- and so forth.
And from the insully.
It doesn't mean that people after their pensionature doesn't have any dreaming bread, because they have not enough money to eat because they have been set so hard to have been so hard as hard to be so hard to be a degree of them to shoot it.
They had to go to the 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The working was willing was willing to double.
So too many choices can be a light working on the lot.
And I think the world through it looks like that.
If it goes to the century to the century to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be regular with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second effect is that we dish the dish of our dish and choose it was less too, finally less too, finally less of the result than it would be if we had less options have had less options of the outcome.
There are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be perfect.
You set in this case, for that a different choice would have been better;
This dreamed alternative alternative that you get spike of your choice.
And then does soil to the enough of choice that you made it up, even if it was a good choice that you made a good choice as it was a good choice
The more options are there to be the more options of the things that are election of uneasier what election of the geots option.
A second reason has to do with substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave cooking gave the value of things that we depend of the things that we equivalent to the things that we equivalent to the same thing.
If you can indent, you can indent, you see many alternatives quickly the attract of all alternatives that you decide to you.
That makes you lesh less with the alternative that you chose have chose.
A excellent excite-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is sort of the example of this example.
This is a set in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second one.
They are on a wonderful strand. Stralend again.
Don't be able to say, "Do the dis," thinks that man, "It's carry.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is excited.
I could flow my car for the door parkers."
And he is two weeks to the idea that he was mislessing every day again, a great parking place that he was mislesson on that he was mislesson.
Exception costs are going to cost of our choice, even if we make a wonderful choice, even if we make a wonderful choice.
The more possibilities are there to be more attract alternatives are there.
And those are presenting us as substitution cost of us as substitution costs.
One example of an example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Like in the here, and now for example, and you have to considered things to be considered here.
And another point is that you have to be a different choice.
And all that other has so his attract as his owns extractly the elected option to the lesson to be engaged.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this for my square to a new breeding breedom to a new breed.
I walk away almost always speak to be speaking out.
Bose there was only one kind of stuff -- and you bought it up, and you bought the past, it doesn't sat incredibly uncomfortable, but if you the breet, you know, but if you were enough to be enough enough and often enough enough it OK.
And I went to the store for a newway.
I said, "Day, I want to speak a spirit, this is my met."
And the winkely said, "Do you smart, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit smart, "Would you smart, easy fit was saying, "Do you smart, "Wilt you smart, easy fit was fitting rel
Do you whether a rit? Whilt you were stone-washed or acid-washed or acid?
Do you want to sull a bree-effect?
Do you have something extending pipes, or flink out, you know, and so he went out and so he went on.
I was spotackle of it. And I said, "I want to say, "I want the only one."
He had no idea which was not a any idea which was and so I have a long hour for a hour for a hour for the point of breed.
In fact, I guess is quite honesty the winkle eventually eventually --
I had done better in the better. I could do it better.
But I didn't felt anything.
Why? To explain this and I write it out of the book of a book.
The reason I didn't feel better with all that choice, I started to expect that I started to expect of the fastly of the speak of a good around.
I started to begin without any any kind of spirit, because I just have a kind of spirit --
And then it turned out there were different and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I requires my breedom with my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
The more possibilities of people have to have more expectations they celebrate about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less peacefully with results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this not.
Because in case you didn't know what I'm talking about.
In the really is going to be about so on.
Everything was bad was bad was bad at was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad was bad to the people have been able to surprising experience.
In our modern society can we as a well-variety of citizens perfection, but the best thing we ever reach to be something so good as well as we have to do it.
And now, we become surprise, because our expectations, my expectations, are tower, tors tower.
The secret of happiness -- the secret for you all come -- the secret of happiness is not too much expect too much of happiness.
I want to be here -- a car biographically elementary -- I am with a woman who is really fantastic elementary that is really fantastic is fantastic elementary biographically is a carbiographically amazing with a woman who is really a
I had not set with her less too.
But less enough to take a good enough to have good opportunity.
And finally, when you buy a bad bad bribe, you can buy be like there but one kind of president, you can ask you ask to ask why you can you ask to why you are intesting.
The answer is that case case is simple.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different breeding available to be a that you buy to fall, who is responsible?
The answer is just as simple. That's you as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different breeding to fail.
So if people decided to take a decisions of that decisions are good decide of their choice.
And they take themselves.
