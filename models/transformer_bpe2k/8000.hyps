Fore years I was showing these two dia's set that the pools the pool, who was the pool, who had the last three million years of the United Stath of the United States, with 40-percent croms.
But this is actually the engineering of this particular problebecause it doesn't the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it is the didnature of the ice of the
The ice ice ice is on the North pool is in a sense of the clopping of our global climatter of our global climate.
It's called the winter and crimpt in the sense in the similar in the similar.
The next dia that I shows that I shows a version of what the last 25 years is happened to happen.
The permanentile is including in room.
As you see it from dark to dark blue.
That's the young ice ice ice ice of the winter.
And the crimpt in the similar in the sion.
The so-manently, five years old, five years older, is almost like blood, that from the boddy, that from the body.
In 25 years is the one of this to this up to this in 25 years --
And that is a problem because the fors of the North IJszee IJszee IJsophim and there is a very big amount of fell wominincluding the methese, when the most of methane, and then the deal in meth,
And the U.S. talk, with the totality of the atmosphere.
In some indeepe of indeepe in Alaska religious methane in Alaska from the water.
And then then the winter fessor Katey Walter of the University Walter of Alaska with another team to another ondiep to another ondiep meer.
Whoo! She is is a question is to be that will be that will be that will be going to be that will be going to be that.
A reason to that, is that this huge "warming bron" Groenland from the novil.
This is a smell pell to be a smell purpose of a smell pully.
The watervolume is echer than it.
This is the Kangerussuain Suidwest-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea little bit of the seeshipes because the landyelt, it's the place where the sea in the sea of sea.
These stroming needed to be fluence.
And then the other side of the planet on the South Pole, bed the South Posmassive smassive massion.
And then the maand rapportedden scientists that the whole continent to a negative ice balance balance balance.
More specific is the ice of the South pool is very quickly to the South pool of the single of waters.
The whole continent to six meter seespieces of seespeace as Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the two after two after the two years ago, there are new markings that a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population of his dreaming water of his dreined that smell in the smell of the global affect of the world's following the world's following of the world's folds of the world's followelse.
In the Andes, is this glester the bron of the drinkwater for this stage.
There are more stroms.
But when they farmer, they also farmer, it also farmer,
In California was a furniture of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes to the waterries in the waterreservice.
And as you could read the predictiny of the predictions are nstig.
This global dreamong to a behavior to a behavioral styraise of fuel brands.
And the number of course, about the world is that the world is that inbelievable and never seen a quire and never seen a quality.
Four time in the last 30 years in the last 30 years in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at a historical context of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton to CO2 ac2 access every 24 hours every 24 hours every 24 hours every 24 hours.
25 miles every day in every day in our oceans, Kook at the eye of the Stille Oceat the U.S. Exxual Oceat every single south of the Indian subcontinent, there is a big, there is a ban in the ocean.
The only big war of the surface of the Earth, nururther to the Earth, which is the foundation, it's the free of phossil brand-following from phossil brands of phoseveral warming.
Oil is a problem, and steended to the allergest problem.
The United States is one of the two size of the two biggest challenge with China.
And there was a front to build a lot more city-cooling cools
But we see a bird of a birth.
These are the cities of carbon which the ban was annumber of the ban was animated in the last years, and where grouple years.
There is a political streedone is a political streedone in our country.
The steenkings and olie-industry gave years, and oil 250 million dollars from to promotion, which is a cool of promotion, which is a connection of promotions.
And that picture of me to something something thinking about that.
And the guys was a thuis in Tennessea about four billion literally four billion literally believed in the four billion literally belied.
You probably see the news in the news of the news in the news in the news in the news in the news of the news in the news in the news in the news
This is the one after the biggest of America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the advertising lines of the coople of the Kerst was deate.
Video: ""Frosty is a cool, is a stage is a stage of cool.
He is flowing up here in America, and he care in America, and he care growing our economy grow.
Frosty the citen's coolman is is the day showed the day --
He was paid and wrong and catch working."
Here's a big particular particular from the citenkool in West Virginia from from the daan.
The biggest is the big blow-the big blowing of Massey Coal.
Video: Donce Blanguage of the Let me duce be Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Pelosi, they don't know where they know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimating protection two campagnes on your tools on on your tool.
This is a piece of a piece of a purposing from a it.
Fideo "Bue COLwory, we see the climate change.
And that is the reason is why the most important thing to give us a gigantic behavior to recline to the light to the light and the response of the value of the value of the value of the value of the truth of the truth is to the the way to the the living to the light
Feit is, you know, is not smarkilled to smart.
We find that the scon is -- and it read is still a little bit of a cooking.
So, you don't make your climate change.
Let me that but about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone city's cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern scone of circle cools of carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines make some lawsing some lawsing a little lays.
But that is the sound of scone of cooling technology.
Our thanks the fact that the free of cities of the most important of the main the main the Earth of the Earth is changing the map of the Earth is the surprising technology that you see here.
Look at the same thing to be the scene cooling technology of the day.
Al Gore: Einvented the positive alternative alternative alternative and that on the built of national security.
Video: Stem: America sell in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climatter crisis.
The rowd wireless is our dependence of picssil of picssil of phossil fuel of phossive and inited oil and inition.
But now there's a during new solution to this out of this is to this out of this.
Fore America of 100 percent scene of 100 percent of 100 percent of 100 percent years.
A plan to get America to get to get a plan that us a plan that us and the surprising of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth
And then it turns out a solution that enough to solve our problems to solve our problems to solve our problems in the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems.
Repower America. OOOOur ne.
Al Gore: And the last strong.
Video: Stem: It's about America to give America to give America to give America.
One of the speech ways to make a end of our dependent of old old foundation of old brandstone-fold.
Man: Here's the future of energy system. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: No you can investments to create good paid to create good pay to create good past.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to be realistic.

Thank you very much.
Fore years I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reft back to come back with a cups about how that machine works.
So here is I am it. For those who didn't waren: the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever education in environment, 27 miles in engineering in enomtree.
It should be the environments that were able to be less than a billions that were less than a billions of the universe that the universe of the universe that was started to 600 million times a second.
And, Enorm ambitius, so!
This is the machine of Geneey.
We took pictures of those less less Big Bangs in detectors in detectors where I work. It's called the ATLASStor -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular photo ATLASSome in attacular that you can see the scale.
And at 10 september we put the machine for the machine for the first time to the machine for the first time.
This photo became by ATLAS. S.
And that care in a facestering in the controllling in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particle that is a photo the LHC ging, and with with the HC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, with a piece of the LHC, by the detector in the detector of the detector of the detect of the first particular ar.
And in other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that is a huge of the machine is a huge government.
I don't know if this the biggest across the biggest of the Internet and saw that the internetpage page of so.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact of a scientific as a scientific as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural as a cultural as a a cultural as a a cultural as a a scientific as a a little bit of a cultural as a a little bit of a scientific as a
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to this golds.
And that behaviors were 13 thousand camps when the machine on followed in followed the machine in the machine in the machine in the machine on on the machine on the machine on the machine on the machine of couple of couple camples of the power.
The engineers under you say, "Not where you say, "Not value to small beh."
They can do because they do because they can idend his temperaturs.
So on 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can behaviors that stroom ago that stroom ago that stroom ago that stroom in 271 grads.
In one of the construction between the neine of the needed in the LHC, sat a constructive,
And it was the wireless was something that was electrical wealthy resemb, and there was a thousand camps.
This was the result.
This is still inpressive if you realize that that magnets more than 20 ton wea, and they about 30 centimeter -- and they about 30 centimeter in the 30 centimeter and about 30 centimeter
We had about 50 months about 50 monkes.
We had to get them out out of stories, what we did it.
We all have them all eparent.
Now they are on wead.
Eind mmap the LHC against is to be tacking.
We will be able to put him and we felt him in juni or right so we can go to the expect of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, that have been insound that inssound the debate of scientific research.
I think that the fact that the fact that it's so hard that we go to go to the fact that we go to the LHC. C.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Davy, diverse Davy, diverse to the Indeal of the value of his lives, his left of his living his living, his left and the most of his teaching the human beings of the human beings to the human beings of the human beings that our imagineering ineer to the imagineering that our imagination of the world that we don't have a front of the world to be not the foot that have a new new ree to be no new mythesesesesesesesesesesesesesesess, and that we we we have no new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new mygeged to have have have have been been been been been been been been been been been been been exister
Thank you.
I would like to ask you to ask you back to your children at your children at your children with blowed with blocks in the blowed with a block with blocks.
When you discovered how you had to frow how to put them up and became up and then you actually have problems to learn to learn by the engineering and hands of space relations.
Rutely insight is strong because with the world to understand the world to understand us hears.
If an information with a information by the physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- together with the advisorder of Pattion and my medicine -- what if we could ask me to ask me -- what we could use a computer -- what if we could use a computer that we could use a computer as a kind of a foundation that we can refar the individuce that we can be a cek with the physical individual to the information with the information with the information with the information with the information with the fount to the information with with with with with the foundource of the inspith, which which which we can we have to rewarward the flay with the ney with the brain the ney the far ar the fount the way that lalay
and you can ordering like we want to do it?
And this question him that we decided to be a answer, by the building of Siftables.
Cort together to a Siftable computer is a interactive computer in a cookingle of a cooking.
They can be able to the dogs are connecteceing their movement detect and they fat, and they were a sharing and turns out and turns out and turns out and turn to the fre.
The nuclear is the physical hands of physical handeless of the physical treatments to graduate the flowed by graph.
And the way are Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital informatter.
And that this is this helping these helping in a more physical different, and even from their movement and even of the way we move them to discussion, there are different new and even different new and some new and also also a new and discovered them to discover and even a different different of the way we moved, and even from the way we moved, and even from their movements of
I will start with some simple example examples of examples.
This Siftable is institution to tell a video to tell a video to be able to be a video and otherset changed to be played to play and otherwise playing.
These interactive portrained to each other.
Indians get each other, they will be able to each other.
If they also be enjob, they also become this and can be what what become some similar to be become some similar and become some sion.
And then they feel movement and doing.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting of the interesting of these interactive, the use of the interactive, the use of the interactive, as it was a fluence of a small as a fluencourage as it was a fluid of a fluistop.
In this example of three Siftables and for a little bit of and I can use them to go to a little bit of a leader to go to a little bit of a regonment.
And if we have flowed a little bit back.
There are some criching craising for the education of the education of language and logics with language and logics that we want to give things that we want to give things that quickly to see the result of the ability to see the result of the eductive celling things that we want to see the result of the education and logically, the
Here's the development of a Fibonaccess of a Fibonacci by a simple returns out programmate.
Here's a spel that a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single letter in every Siftable, and feed the Siftable, and feed the words in a wordbook.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescut, and different, a new series of a new series of mobilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excure to the Media Lab, and I am in the Media and I am them to make a video of a video of it.
They were actually actually actually actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these access is that people are no instructions that people needed to have no instructions have to have no instructions of these accountation is that people needed to have to have no instructions of these access is that people neestructions of the most interesting things of the most interesting things of these accountation of the
Everything you have to say "Mo's word" and they know what they need to do to do.
Here's some people on the testing of the tests.
That's our young guy bities at the young birds.
And it looks like he single the Siftables well.
For him this was just bloke.
Here's an interactive paintiny fluence.
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language of language.
This is Felix that demonstrent.
He can bring new carracters in the scene of the Siftable with that carakter of the table.
Here's the sun of the sun of the sun of the son up the son.
Video: The sun comes up to it.
David Merrill: now now he has a tractor in the scene buildings.
Video: The orange tractor.
Goed though,
And for the scuue of Siftables and the nature together to respond to reagging with each other, and the nearakters with each other.
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a story with a purpose to a story.
and he decided to the free.
Video: The cat fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly ffly ffly fly fly fly ffly fly fly fly fly ffly ffly fly fly fly fly fly fly f
DM: The last example that I will show show that I will show you a synthesizer and live music childhood that we developed a sound product as the lead, which is a sound as the lead, so free and drum.
Eengineering four different experiences, where you can be able to be used to use what you want to use what you want to use
And this sounds can be in a lege Siftables so that you can be the pattern to be able to certain the pattern itself in a re-ftables in a re-ftables in the pattern in the pattern in a teend-Siftables can be the pattern in the patternnns
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a living a likely Siftable effects like reverb as reverb as reverb as reverb and movie moon.
They are become a sound to a sound and attace by cancy.
And then the almost of the almost of the tempo and volume that are access on the whole pattern.
Let's look at let's look at it.
Video: We start with a lead. We begin with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, flength by a extra lead.
Now, I place the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline line the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: Now, I feel what I feel a little bate.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter of the filter of the flowing for the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the flolowing the effect of the philo.
Video: I can be a very quickly requences by the changing of the tempo bloke.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can resciking it with the pattern as it played in the play.
So I don't need to be anything to plann, but I can improvisers, and it very longer and shorter as I want to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the point and short to be very longer and short to be very longer and short a little bit of plann, and I want to make a little bit of the point and
And in the end of the dimmmit from the volume of the volume Siftable to canteleth.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make a different different from new peop-computer interfaces that are including in the way our brain's invent on the way our brain and body.
And today I had to show you a new election in this design design design in this design design buildings with some possibilities that we developed to develop the developing that we developing in the lab.
The dad that I want to talk about to to a little bit about a very new generation is to a very new generation of the interacters, which is the information to digital media, which is the information to our world as we want.
I dance you from hard.
I look at the way from to you to talk to you with you all to talk to you with all of you all to talk to you all of you all to talk to you all to talk to you all of the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also a lot more than that.
My whole life I am am am I I was writing a long life and I don't think that that will change that will change it.
And then there is something that happened in my life and career and career and career and career with my work with my work on with my work to see in my work to see in the work of the work to see
And the began to a book, I had really, a measure measure -- a memoire: "Ets, Bidddle that very in connection to my first third work the whole world about and an international existorore and an international existor.
And the population is that people now to be tiny and always always tiny as if I mean to bit.
And the thing -- you know, do --
People come to me and ask me and ask you to ask me to be that success you never have this success to eat the same thing to eat the point that you never have to eat me and ask to me and questions,
You don't know that you will never be able to you be able to write a book, but never a book that people will never be a book that people will learn to learn to be able to learn to be a book in the face of the living to write your whole life will never be able to write a book at at the same thing that people will never be a book in the book that people
You don't know that you don't know that you have to be a bat?"
Erg hintand, you know, you know.
Now, of course, that would be very very I remember that I remember about 20 years ago, I was a tienter -- I was told that I was told that I was told that I wanted to be.
People said, "Ben you don't have to be that you never get success to be success?
You don't know you get to be a deside, that you have to be in the way to be in the front of that you have to be able to be in the way to be in the way to be in the way to be in the way to be in the way to be in the way.
You don't know that you know that you live on this work that we have a lot that there is something from a little bit of the wrong of your built on the puin of your built with your bitters, with your months of falen?"
Even in that streting.
In the short comes to this questions on this now, "Yeah,
Yeah, I'm a bang for all those things that are enough that enough.
Also, all of the time.
But I also have a lot of other things bang, you want to know that for all of all of the things that all of all of the things that you want to know that for all of other things that you want to know that for all of other things bang, you want to know that for all of other things that you want to know that for all of other things that you want to know that all of other things that you want to be a lot of other things that you
For example, and other engineer, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing to the last time to the last time that the angst of the last time to come frow from.
Is the ration?
Is it logical that somebody is that somebody is to be a working for the people who are on Earth his mention on Earth are on Earth are on Earth are on Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the geesterness of people who has not happen.
Take my father. He was screen -- he was scaled to me that there was in the 40 years that there was in the 40 years that he had ever ever ever ever ever had to him or he was not a big, or he was not a big, or he was not a by.
And that "Yohn, how is it with your chemicky?"
No, so it was not about it.
To be fair to be able to be able engineers have to be a hone by the century hone not the reputation of study manic-depressive coholists to be study to be a lot of stuff --
Scheat, which have a kind of reputation.
Not just writing a lot of creative people have to be the reputation of people have been able to be instable.
Look at the grimmer is to the grimmer of the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many stiod, often young young in their own accountable to do it.
And even degenes that no self-ord place place to be their gave to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a swell.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Meet every my books is a piece of mouth."
That's what to say to say about your life's living work.
But of this kind of exercise we don't look at it.
We all heard it all heard and have heard the first and accepted.
The hearing send sense that creativity is that creativity is that creativity to be a poor, and that a poor, and that will read to elelse.
So I want to ask everybody here today you with that idea of life?
Fineded you that OK?
Because I think I don't even think about that, I think about it all of the way I don't think about all the way in the time.
I think I think it is a little bit of it.
And also even though dangerous.
I don't like to see that this this century also as good.
We can creative feet a lot better than a lot better than a lot of life.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, without dangerous to that dark to that dark in the dark of life.
Sequales the fase in my career now now now now now in the career now now
Go but after you say, "I am a vehicles.
I can be more four decades of the decades.
Hoogsts probably will be all the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the work that extraordinary book that extraordinary book.
We are here with friends under each other, so I can be selling you to be seen the biggest success to be a biggest success.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think if you think about your eyes for your eyes to the cheat at the church of the drank.
So I don't want to be not.
I love me love to the work that I love to the work that I love to a --
The question is, "Hue?"
After country, I think there's a long conclusion that I can just go to writing a psychological protection as I can protection in the process in the process in the process in the process involved in the process of the process involved in the process of the process of building in the process of the conclusion as I can be a psychological prote
I should be able to create the writing of a far distance between mitself and my survive and my survive and my surprise to the responsibilities in my future audience.
I have the last year, I had to ways to do that.
I am in the history, and I do in other days and make me in other civilizations to see or others to see or others to help people have creative people to help to help people to help to help the emotional process.
My seettook me to the old Greek and Romenon and Romenens.
Let me because it's a long and including story.
In the time of the old Greek and Romen's old Greek and believed people not creativity of henself.
Men beliefth that creativity was a godddling a godnments of a re, unknown to the ments and inknowledge and inknowledge and unknowledge of the human beings of a godnments a god-far, to the human beings of a goddnments that creativity was a god-f
The Greeks called these Greeks called this crapid of creativity "demonen."
And in the one of Socrates beliefed that he had a demon that he had influistered him in the fluistered to influist.
The Romeneny had a spectable idea.
And if you have to them a conident creative creative medicative in a geni."
The grapport is that the Romined with a geny of a genee of a gence of a gence of a genee of the deattention.
In their police was a geny kind of magical godnments that removed in the murs of the ateltion of the ateltion of the artist.
A little bit like Dobs of the housesesed.
And if the artists was a working on the genassistentical --
Our shapes he work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the dead that I talked about the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work in his work in his work
The artists was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you don't have a brilliant was not all the eer.
Everybody knowled-cray that a invisible.
Well you work with your work work -- you know, not just to you, you know,
Everybody knew that you have a nogal independent gence.
Lange time is that that was the Wests creativity was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and change everything.
There is a very new idea: the individual human be: the individual ments of the universe and mysteries.
And a space for mystical weather, intended from the godnment.
And that was the beginning of the rational housesesed.
People believed that creativity of the individual extincluding the individual extincluding that creativity
And for the first time in the history, there was about artists that they were a genion, and not that they were a genion.
I have to say that I should find a big front of a big front of a big front of a big front of that I should find a big front of that.
And to show one person one person on one person that he or the felt that he or the sourcer is the sources of the source of the major of the major of the devices of the consider to a much more responsibility for a framp for a frasimilar to a much for a much to a a lot of responsibility for a frammal of a cell of a single human beingle human beingle human beingle is is a lot of the
Also, or you ask the sun in the so.
Ego's become up to gigantic provided to gigantic provided to exactly exactly exactly cincluding to exactly cess.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years artists of artists has made a lot of artists --
And if that is, and I think is the question: "What do is the question: "What do is no?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old back, and we start to a old relationship between the human relationship?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can 500 years rational humanism not under to make a 18 minutes.
And probably the suses in the audience of scientific people who have been talking about the idea that else fightters with some facts with some facts with some facts of the work of artists to inspiring high-high-high-tes and bring high-follow-like far felt of the idea that is to inspiring artions of the idea that else that is to inspiring in the audience of the idea that that fishigh-fighting to
It doesn't seems me that I will get to get to be in that I will get to get you in that I will get to be in that I will get to be in that I will get to be in that I will get to be in that.
And I ask me to me.
Why not?
Why should we we have that thought?
It is just like all the other elects as all the other election of the totally crowed under that decided to creative process.
Everybody who has to create something something has to create -- so in fact, so in fact, that the creative process -- that the creative process is not always rational process.
And that sometimes it almost paranormale.
I have unlanguages, the great American animal Ruth Stone of the American Ruth Stone of the major of the great.
They are seen in the negentig. Her whole life all of the writing of the writing of the needed in the ngenty.
She told me about her young on the plattle of Virginia.
Some of them if they were on the felt of working on the set she heard a poem about the country.
And it was so she said thing, if there was a big golf air.
And that one of a fell felt than the country to her across the country.
She felt that the foot that the foot was in that that her in that time to do that her on that moment to do in the front of her life.
They ring up to home home is following the followed and they had to see as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly to pay and see them to see the cray and see it as quickly to set up and then so.
When the founded by her home came up by her home was that her only chance to write it on the only chance to write it on the only chance to writing her home to write the only chance the only chance the only chance the only cancer to writing her home to writing her only by the only chance the ged of her hund up by her hold her hold her h
Some was not quickly enough.
And then then you get to ring and ring it it home.
And in that one moments the foundaries of her heat, felt the many of seek -- in her words -- to another dich,
And there were even though -- this is that I think this beautiful part of the story -- that they were almost of the story.
And then she was seen in house on house and paper, and then it was the set by her heat.
Juist at that moment she had a potable to pay a potile to pay
And with her other hand, so told me so told me to the felt out of the air.
They pay the purch, and he was a little bit back in her body, while they were the surprise it to the surprise it to the surprising up in her body,
And in that case, it came out that in the sense of a very paper in a very papier, but then in the engineered followed followed in the followed in the followed in the sense of the papire.
And then I thought that I thought -- what I thought -- what I think -- what I think about creative process my creative process to be a creative process to be a process of the call,
And that works my creative process to be a medium! I don't have medium!
I am a mouse of a mouse in the same time stip and put them with blood, and transseen with blood, and transseen and transforming and transforming up with blood.
But even in that day's equal I had had a experience a experience of experience in that experience of experience in that day.
You also will also be able to know it that feeling creative ideas in your oprely in your hearing from a brothern that you can identify intentify to identify.
What is that that is that for brone?
How can we use it without that we get it without that we be?
And in a way that we do for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think that I can think is musician Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time a while,
We had to government it.
Tom is a lot of his life is a big part of his life life is the showed of the several artists that from all the major that are tried to get to the under creative impultil creative impulsable creative impulation that in him in him of him that in him in fact.
And I was a little bit of the ''d be a little bit of the years.
And in Los Angeles Angeles Angeles in Los Angeles of the process radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical redical radical redical remember the set
And while he heard there, he heard a fragmentation of a melodie.
The behavior to him, like inspiration that is free bird -- crowellend.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fashithese.
But it doesn't go to it.
He had no papery, no paper at a tperecorder to see a tperecorder to see a tperecorder to see a paper in the face.
The well-known spanness of the hemeless of the hemelos that covering couple of the equired century and then the me evenue.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it good enough."
He didn't have a crazy in panics, but he stop all of human process and death to do something news.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry heard and said, "Sorry you can't see that I set it up to be the studying to the stuff it up to the stud?"
"Do you really know that I can be a love of the free of the writ?
If you really want to come to come out that this lost to you go to you even even know if I have to you've got time for you have to you've got to you,
Not not, you know, you go to somebody else fall.
Go buurts at Leonard Cohend." And from that moment the process of the process of them very different.
And the work is still the same same thing with the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark itself,
But the size of the surprance that creative process in him reflected to distance the genion.
The geny set him to the house and read the set and read the craising up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to go through it.
It could also be a wonderful bird to be a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner of Tom and the propertile that not to be a lot of Tom itself --
And that story has changed my way of work.
I have already already had.
I was took in the write process of Ets, Biddary.
And in a consation in a wrong.
You know that that you don't want to be a good good and you think that it is a difference of a difference. The bad book it.
Not similar bad bad bad to bad it.
I wanted to do it all of the project to all the project to all the project all of the project to all the project to do it all of the project to do it all the project.
And then I remember Tom who who are geniod, and I decided to be a power, and I also go to way.
I knew I knew me from my manuscrips and ridge to a a lower of the room.
And I said to say, "Luister done that if we know that if this book not brilliant is not just to be a book not just by me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in what I have in me.
And I can't feel that I can't feel
If you find that it to be better than you have to be able to you you get to do your thing to do you do to do anyway.
Snap you don't know that you don't know that you don't know you --
I just write just because that's a little bit of my work.
Oh, and in the notile that are just going to be a little bit of the cray that is just a differentor differentor differently.
Ta--- Uited to take the now, it in the nere-...
Eeut, there were in the North African an-African an-African an-African ants to maybe maybe to dancing to danced to danced to the sick.
Uren and hours, to the morning glors.
And that was always great because the dances were completely professionals.
But sometimes some of that, very echter something like this.
One of those dangers became transcendent.
You also know what I mean, you have some of that, you ever ever seen to a performer.
It was like the time when the time was silled and the dangered by a poor.

June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had to have it all about a couple of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean and discovered to the new sets of genes.
We actually started to a new point, we were to the biology to the digital issue to the digital code to a new physal code to a new physics to a new physics, and synthetissue of life.
So we always tried to be a big questions to be a big question.
"What is living something something that I think what a lot of biolos have to understand a lot of different levels in different levels in different level,
We tried to be tried to less imal components.
We're now now now the digitalization of the digitalize.
When we have sequence, we have sequence, it was from the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask the question, we can we regenerate regenerating, from this digital universe of this digital universe of this digit?
This is the map of a little organizing organizing a little bit called Mycoplasma genitself to a kind of a kind of that check itself can be conmentor in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we have to a little bit of genome genome to come up to come to come to come to come to be able to come to be able to come to a non-fall.
We can be in the order of hundred gences from the 500 or whose that there are there.
But if we look at the metabolic map, that relative simplication with the unso.
Gell me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can be a stuff that could be very unliving a living cell that would be a living cell to read a living cell.
We decided to be that the only route to provided this chromosphere to synthetise so we could be the components to synthetissue to the most fundamental questions to ask the most fundamental questions to be so that we could be the most fundamental questions that we could be the far to be the front of the most
And so we start with questions like "Can we started asking a chromosphere?"
Staat the chemy to make these very big molecules that we never have a very big molecument?
And, if we can do that chromosphere?
A chromosphere, is a piece is a piece of chemically, a piece of chemically,
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is requency on exponential education.
Our moving to write the genetical code to write the genetical code of the genetic.
And our last point that would be on this moment in a exponential curve.
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some city for a couple city to a bio-ethical ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthese.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how more old you to be the study of the old thing that you have a little front of the old front of the old thing that we are far the study of the ff of them are front of
So we had to make a new method to the concluding these little pieces and the corns of all the front of all front of all the front of all the food.
And this was our first poging, with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little four rus that bacteria that bacteria --
We designed the study pieces of the stuckes, the foundary.
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the spanning part of that we started a piece of chemical stor in the bacteria in the bacteria code of the genetical code and vironments and virtual particles and vironments and vironments of gonment.
The virale particles were regiving up when they were loved from the cells, they came back and dood-coli.
I was unlanguage in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that they had to be a good good to be good to be a good good quickly well.
They laught more than you love.
And why we think that this is a situation is a situation is to build this is to build this is a biological system.
But we wanted to something a lot of a lot of greater a lot of bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetical code.
And we decided to build them in cassettttle in cassettttle of viruses that we could experience the cassettttttttle --
to understand what the stuff what the cell celling a living cell.
The designer is crucial information in the computer with digital information in the computer than that need to be very accureat that digital information is very accuat the computer than that digital information.
When we were the first time we put this genome in 1995 was the standard-precision was a 10,000 basepares.
And then we could be followed 30 front of 30 front of the original sequencement was not in the way.
Our part of the designs of the design of studying studying 50 letters to all the other studying with all the other studying with all the other studying little bit of the sub-simply front of the connection that we can be able to design so that they can be a shap,
We design here is a lot of these parts in the parts in the parts in the parts in the parts in the parts of these parts in the parts in the parts in the parts of them.
Maybe you may have a lot of watermers.
Bethink we have a four four genetical code: A, C, C, C, and T.
Tozo-from that letters cos for the run 20 aminozurs -- that there's a simple attention is a simple of each aminoy-oxyoxyoxygen in the aminozoring for every aminozurs for every aminozurs of that letters cos of the letters of the letters of those coalitation is
So we can use the genetical code to write words to write words, and though,
And we have to make signs we just just asked to me.
Some of them were teleurged that there were no disease.
We have these pieces so we can be so extractly with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they reparate and put them in each other.
And we started to make pieces of cheasy with studying with studying five to 7,000 letter countries that are sets of 24,000 letter, and you have a 4,000 letter, and then 24,000 letter, to 72.000.
In any casures we could be a cradied of these study so we could sequences because we want to create a process that very robuy is that very robuy -- that you see a process -- that you see a process --
We try to get the point of automatisissue.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so we come to come to the really big stuff -- more than 100,000 basegs -- more than 100,000 based, they don't have to be so easy more in E.
And that exercise the modern of the modern of the models of the molecular biology.
And we went to rain other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombination recombination by biology to reparents by biology to reparers, that stuck up to food.
Here's an example of it.
There is a organized Deinoccoccus radiodurans that three million radiodurancus to can.
And that you see in the following pane: a chromosphere is just from the each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he was going to go back in the other, exactly like the first one.
There are thousands of organizing organisms that around.
These organisms can be a completely to be a lot of these.
They can live in a vacuum life.
I know absolutely that there is life in space that can exist, that can previous existence.
Now, NASA has to show that there is a lot of course, that there is a lot of the thing that there is a lot of the thing that there is a lot of it.
Here's a little bit of the molecule that we have made with this processed that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- facts with the right designs that we did in the right design.
And then you know that they can foot automatically food.
This is not an electronen-microscope, this is a microscope photograph.
It's a big front molecule that we can see it with a light microscope to see the light of a light microscope.
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiency that we extraordinary that we extraordinary
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetical code.
It's the biggest molecule has made by people, with a duce of people with a duce structure.
The molecuments is more than 300 million.
If we would deft it with a 10-point letter, without speaking about 10-page page of the genetical code of the genetical code of the genetical code of the genetical code of the genetical code with a 10-points with a 10-point.
Now, how do we starting a chromosphere? How actives? How activit? How active we he?
And a four rus is the clearly is a single easy.
And I want a bacteria is the much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukard, as eukaryots, like eukaryots, and you do a different in and do, and that is what you know as as the clons.
And if you the bacteria is the chromosphere is the chromosphere.
We have a chromosphere's a chromosphere.
These are about so far as far as people and mically.
We foot what extra gences so we could sell this chromosphere.
We have the conted, we have to make all the easy.
It was woman when we put this in the cell -- and you will put the very avanced graphical images here -- the new chromosphere -- the new chromosphere.
We even thought he even thought he would come to come to come to come out the process what would come out of the process of the process of the process of them to develop the process what would be removing to be a process to be a process of the process of it would come out of the process of the process what would come out of the process of the process of the process of them to come out of the process of the process what it would come out of the process to come out of the process of the process.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We found all over the way we found a second chromosphere to have a second chromosphers or a third thousands of chromospities in one time to the species.
People that evolution is evolving evolved to have a lot of biology is not much biology much biology to be a lot of biology to be a lot of biology --
There are enzyms that restrictive enzymmists are enough.
And the chromosphere, it was not eat.
The cell -- the chromosphere -- the chromosphere -- which is what we stop in strong --
It was expression, and the requency and recognize the other chromosphere, and we had the cell of the cell we had just the cell with the new chromosphere.
He was a blue from the genes that we had stopped in the genes that we had stopped in it.
And in very short time and all the carakists of the carakists of the ene species and changed he completely in the new species, buildings that we had stop in the cell.
All eglobal changes, the membranes -- when we changed the genetical code -- it was the precise was changed to change the genetical code --
This is maybe you clink as genomically, but we are in the state, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally --
And I have been paying all of the Camic explosion, is -- this is present -- this is present on 3.5 billion years, and I paid for a new species that we may be able to a new species that we could be a new species that we have a big species on big species in big species where there there is a great species of the digital design.
Why would you do this do?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what you look at what it is to what there is a little bit of it.
We're going to go in a ses-half to be a billion people, for a billion people, during the next 40 years.
To o put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet...
for each of us who in 1946, within 1946, within 40 years of us are four years.
We have to food with food with the food of screen water, medicine, medicine, follow-half billion.
And that is a lot to do that for needed to do that for for that.
We use five billion ton collabs, more than 30 billion fath millions.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or which is to be process than also to reflect that a huge challenge exercis;
Then of course, there is all those carbon dioxide of the stop in the atmosphere is really come.
And for all our world's discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the designer as the designer of the future of the future.
The electronicaindustry had to the animals and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is front of the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity had to the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is that from the diversitevicaindustry.
We are predicted by an biological reality and our excination and our excination and our excination.
We don't have techniques to do techniques to do a little bit of the combination genomics to do the combinative genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosome.
If you know about the conversation of the coptimes, or to make processing to optimalise to make octon to make or medicine or medicine, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change with a small team changes, we can change in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can selecter for living vatbirth, chemical or brandstope production, vaccinproduction -- and so on.
This is a screen imagination of what real designermazing design, so that you really really really to the gang and a new kind of the computer on the computer in the computer in the computer in the computer in the computer in the computer of what real design.
We don't know how it will see how it will see it out of it.
We know exactly how their genetical code from disease.
We friit now on four generation brandstone.
Our global you have to ethanol of your face, just a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation brandsts that will come out from come from come out of the sugars like sugars like octon or or different suses like octanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a big influence without the food neighborn, and the described the described as we begin to be a food as a food as his food as his food as his food to be a way to be a way to be able to be able to be able to be the first four generation and within the first four generation and within the first eass and then we are far to be a generation and then foot the ffood and then we started to have food to have to have to have to have a food to be as as as as as much as food food to have
Sunlid and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our world's discoveroverovered the discoveries of the global read other methos.
This is an organizing that we have to protect in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers deep, at coaling temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular waterstor as energy waterstor as energy bron.
We are looking at the same thing we can take to take CO2 and what easy to four pipipes to fabried, where that CO2 to fabring to brandster to brandster this process to sturban to sturb.
So in a short of a little bit of that we think we are in a way that we are to break in the basal question: "What is living the basal question: What is living in a short of the basal question: "What is living in a short of a short in a short of the basal question: "What is living in a shor
We have a little bit of you know -- you know, the protect the petrochemical industry.
Yeah, if you can't do this at TED -- where you can't do it in TED
A important energy brother.
But we also work on the way to use these works to be to care servaccines faccines of these works.
This year was the foundation, we always always just like the facts of the facts of the facts on the right foundation on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change from teforming teforming vaccinating vaccination of teforming vaccine.
Here's how the future can see how the future can see the evolution, the evolution, the equal with synthetic bacteria, and inventually eukard, archeukaril.
We are still far far from the concerns of people.
Our goal is certainly to be able to make a chance enough to survival that that well. Thank you.
What I want to show you if you to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to bring a new technology that we have to bring about a year ago. This is Seehavion.
And it's a environment where you can be able to immense with immense of immense of the data data to be visual data to be a fish.
We look at the same thing here here is to digital images and can be here in the maining and except on the way -- and exercise and the sors and the sors and the sorts to our anss.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big to these collections or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images of information or images or images or images or images of information or images or images that
Most of his normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan from the Library or Congress, and sit in the 300 meapixel of the 300 megapixel of the 300 meass.
It all doesn't matter because it all of the prestatishing what the prestate, the amount of pixels on a third system, the amount of pixels.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, a lot of nothing that is a completely book, a completely book, a completely book, a completely book, a completely book, a completely book, a completely book, a lot of not.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Elke is a headd piece.
And to evidence that it is the truly is that it really took a picture, we can do something like this, to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of a strange of a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a book in a a book in a a book in the front of a e-book.
I wouldn't be a lot of it.
This is a realistically, example of The Guardian. This is a check of The Guardian.
Every big image deal image is the beginning of a death of a deal.
This is a really gives you really the experience of a real paper of a real paper or crow a scale or calcular medicine is actually a scalend medium is actually a scalend medium of medium is actually a scale of a real paper and the experience of a real paper and the experience of the experience of a real paper
We also have something done something with the cording of these except of The Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the abilities of these author, you can see it it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to care that we can actually be the constents of hands of hands that we can do the care of the care of the care of the care of the care that we can do the care that we can do the care that we can do the the constraine.
We don't have that this is no pop-ups more means and other third -- not to be more more than not to be more than be to be more more than that.
Of course, a nurally maps a for the hand the connect to a technology like this, I will be here to spending a time to spenduring that we can also be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of behavided to this fellow out of the felt of the felt of the hand that we can also be a much more than a lot of the follow-ad.
These are all the weak in the U.S.
And the followed on a imagination of the NASA
Let's look at something different.
This is the way to the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who two techniques two techniques with each other.
A erfrom a Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer fishing computer by Noah Snavely, provention, provenue of Washington the University of Washington U.W. Washington U.World
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is the Web. It's the gridge of the cragon.
When we do, we see this -- we see that we see by the images and the multi-resolution experience.
The space shorking of the images of the images here is that meanings.
The computer vision of the vision of these images have these images together, so that they are connected to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canades -- where they are are the genomoman -- where they are you seeing elected or panorities -- and all these things are space.
I don't know if there's another time you have to show you some of them --
There are a lot of space.
I want to like to a Noah's original data-sets -- and this is one of a early prototype of Photosynthessentially to this such that we worked in my head is to the communicate that we have to be the crather of these techniques in the environment, in our website.
We had to reach the advocates with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at the same same time in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flicks, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the campus of the U..
And each of these orange chirs give a picture that part of this model of this model of this model of this model --
And so his all this Flickr imagining imagining in this way in this way in the way that are coperate in the way that are all the way of the way that are all the way of these way in this way in this way in this way in this way in the way that are all the way in the way that we all care of the way that we all crather than you know,
And we can make a simple evidence to nature it.
You know, I had never thought I had never thought I would have ever work.
It's a little bit of the things here is so explained here to be so extraordinary.
I believe you can see that this many types of camera's people are the girl-flexing cameras, a big case of them in this environment.
I will try to find some strange what strange of the images
There are so much more concerned and equires and equale.
Eries in this this is even a series of pictures -- there are here.

Our identity, too a fingree of us existing us is now about choices, like you can see on this dia sease.
Our identition is to be able to solve our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often -- so often we wanted to be a lot of it.
Everybody ocheat the opstinion to be what to be to be a person you want to be to be able to be a person you want to be able to be able to be able to be to the surprise to be to the surface.
Let's talk about the house of the house of the house of the house.

The only working, with with while you was while you were in the next thing that you were deserved in the next thing --
Now freedominally to the surface.
I eevolved in a particular students, which I think about twintive percent housing in homintool.
They are not heus to be a bommer or in earlier than in earlier in earlier in earlier.
No, they have the pressure with choices that choices.
"Salready I would not like that? Sell I now felt it?
Or will I waught to you? Not children, or a care?"
These are all the way to ask questions.
They go through to them to have a answer to a answer, they don't get their house to get their house and then no good ceasy and then no good cover.
And they have the same thing to ask of the questions of questions.
And then we come to work. Carl just like that technology is that technology to work every minute every minute of every day -- where in the world -- even more than the Randolph Hoteltelliph Hoteltel.
There is one place that I love a place that I love in the WiFi is the go.
I don't explaining that because I want to keep for me.
But good, who are huge choices of work in that we still keep in that we still feel at the time, or we go on time on the time, or we go to work or not.
We can look at a footbaldge of our son of our son with us cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side.
And even if they all out of the stine, we all every minute from that weath, with all of the question: "Sall I asked this phphone?
So I would I reager? Semailtine reager? Sale?
And even if the answer is the answer, we experience the footbaldge of our son on on a very different way.
Where we also look at the group, the group, materialistic things that listyle of craise is a craise of cood.
And that saw the world there was asked to the world a lot of it.
There were a choices, but not everything was a crasty of cood.
And so the world looks like the world now looks like this.
The question is now, this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or
The answer: "Yeah,
We all know what we are good to be good to what is a bad of what is a bad to what is a bad to be a bad to it.
And that huge choices two effects, two effects, two effects on the human beings.
A very connection is that the first thing is that the first ones than freedomined than freedom.
And with a lot of choick of people that are the laster to make a choice.
I give you a very behavior to investment in freet, a research of the research of planns.
A colleague will be a colleague to investment in Vanguard, a big policy society, a big policy societies about 2,000 feet, a million works.
They discovered that for every tions of provided to any timess, which is far far the worked in the particular process of the works of the works.
And if you fifth foundies are at least as a little bit of less workings with five founds. Why?
Because it is the foundies so lasts so laster is so laster to care as a choice to the next day, and that that people are just to the next day, and that that are cra, and so on.
And of example.
And that means not just that people after their pensive to eat the time they don't have to eat because they have not enough money because they have a choice as a choice was so laster as a little bit of the choice of the choice of a little bit of a little bit of the choice.
And then they loved to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to their neus to go to a year to go to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollar.
The worked about the work's working to reach their own behavior to reach their own behavior.
So many choicy can be a lot of choicicy-working

If it to the century to the ecentury, you want to be a very so.
You don't want to be surprise to the saled fonds, or even the wrong dressing.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we, if we also had the lost of us and cooking us and cooks, inventually less tester with the result than it would be less less less less less less less less less less we had had been a less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less less we had to be a feel like we had to have the far effect.
And there's global reasons for a lot of reason to feet.
One of that, there's that there is that there is a choice, for example of tallowed to be perfect.
You know, you get to a sense that one would be a different choice that one would be in a case in a case in a case for that a case for that a case in a case for that another choice that a different choice for that another choice of a case for that another choice of a case of a case in a case that a case in a case of case that one would be in

And he seen two weeks to set up there with the idea that he was a great parking parking a great park place.
And institutions, we have to cost of the following we have a great choicenge of our choicically.
How more possibilities are more possibilities are more possible alternatives are going to be a couple alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternatives are possible.
And that presenting presenting us as substitutions.
And then a example of an example of an example.
This imagineering story, you know, this imagination of a couple of points.
Like in the way, and now for example, and that you don't have to survive things not to survive things.
And then a point is that you with any choice other choices excise of choices excise to each other.
And all that other has so much that other has so farmers are reminmind to be reminmind to be reminmind to be a little bit of the couple of the getting cluding ckeletc.
Ten is the escalation of the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this in my visual to a new benought to a new bird to a new bird to a new bent.
I always turn almost of the wireless of it.
First there was a kind of player -- and you cood, and you know, the paintable to be incredibly incredibly incredibly enought to be a bunch country, but if you felt the birth and felt enough it felt the town.
And after the ''d go to the winter for a new wea.
I said, "Day, I want to speak a little bit of my made my made my mot."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart smart -- easy fit or relaxed with relaxed a fit?
Wilt you or a rit? Whilt you have a rit? Whilt you crow?
Wilt you a bad with set effect?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flink out of the pipy." And so he went out and so it it it go.
I was played a little bit of it. Na time you said to me the only bought the only bone."
He had no idea which was no idea that was that was a hour countries that was a hour countries that was a hour countries of the moirs of the possible bly birth of the possible bly bities that was a hour countries of the front of the front of the birth of the front of the front of the possible bly bit’s not have an hour.
And then, I return, I remember the winkell endded with a couple of the bent.
I had to be a better mean that could be a little bit of the possibilities I could do it in the time.
But I don't feel that I don't feel that
Why? Om this to myself to explain a book, I got a book.
The reason I didn't feeling me to feeling with all that choicicy, that I started expecting to expect the speed of a good speak of a good speak.
I started without any kind of a single expectaneous of a kind of speak of played to know --
And then then there was a different wars, and one of them would be a perfect.
And what I was cheat, but not perfect.
So I remove my benhouse with my benhouse with my front of teleur.
How more possibilities people have to expectincluding to expectancestate about the reservice.
And that means people less tests are with results with results are the good results are good results.
Marketings people know this not.
Because in that case you don't know where I know that that I now about it.
In the real is about so on.
Everything was a bad everything was a bad at at the beautiful.
Because when everything was bad was a bad people could have more rassend experience.
In our modern society, we can we as a vard citizens as a perfection of perfection that something that we could ever be including something as well as we had to expect as we had to expectincluding a lot of perfection as we had to be a little bit of perfection
And now, we have been responce because our foundations, my expectations, and highly hope.
The several sound -- this is that that you get to -- the health -- the health of sound is not a much much of sound.
I want to give you a carry here -- a autest -- I would be a autest -- that I was a woman who really really really really great great great to be fantastic is a great great detastic election.
I didn't have a little bit of a little bit of tackaged in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little testranged.
But with less enough to be good cances.
And then then you get a bad of the front of the speak of the speak as a kind of present -- you can ask your indepengugue you can ask your intiny why you can deal with the front.
The answer is that case in that case is that case in that case in that case in that case in that case in that case in that case is simple.
The world is responsibility. We had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of a hundreds of them to fall, who is that turns out to fall, who is than responsibilit?
The answer is just so simple is just so simple.
You had a better choice can make a better choice.
And with hundreds of different blowed to fale.
So if people decided to take out of the results of that decisions are good in the front of the choices about their choice.
And that needed themselves itself itself to quale.

But that's not that it is not
It doesn't have no two-felt that can be better than not coose better than not care, but it doesn't carefully automatically that more choice that more choice that more chooice that more choice that more chooice that can be more choice.
There is a magical foundaries of choices that I don't know
But I know that we have been able to be a long time that choicically, that choices are what we repreciation to be behavior.
Now, there's a principle -- I am am almost of a principle where we can keep the best to keep the best to keep the best to keep the best to be in the best to be in the best to be in the best to be the best to be the best to be in the best of the best to be the best to keep the best thing that we can keep the best to keep the best thing --

That's what economists and a Pareto-concertainly reflecting and a Parea
Everybody is to rereverversion of the map -- not just arming arm -- and that comes through the last of choicickly that we know with our behaviors.
And so so that if you have this imagined story, you know, soxyle as a developed ments saying, "Ach, what is fish is there there notion of the fis?
Nothing is possible in a vision of a vision of a vision of a visu."
A scale regularly return, a shortile world's first interpretation.
But how longer I think about it.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the visual to create the visual to create possibilities to create the freedomination.
If you get the visual to create the visual abilities to create the fish.
It leads to more reflection and less tester and less tester and less tester and less tester and less tester and less teaching a little bird-testing and less tection and less teced.
Everybody has a vision to a vision to be a vision.
This is freedominally to be a -- even for the fissue for us.
But the desides of a figuual visual vision to say to ask ellend, unheil.
Thank you very much.
