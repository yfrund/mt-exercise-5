I showed these two dia's two dia's to show that the pool, which the pool, who had about the past three million years of the vastable to the size of the United States of the United States was 40 percent cromp of the United of the United of the United of the United States was about the size of the United States of the vastate of the day.
But this is actually the rest of this specific problem because it doesn't have the didness of the ice.
The ice skp on the North Pole is in a certain the way, in a certain the class of our global climath system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I show is a quickly about what is happened the last 25 years is happening 25 years is happened in the last 25 years is happened in the last 25 years of what happened is happening is happening the last 25 years of what happened is happening is happening about the last 25 years of what happened is happening is happening about the last 25 years is happened to see is the last 25 years of what the last 25
And the permanently recently in the rood.
As you see it comes from dark to donkerlaw.
That's the year of the year ice of the winter.
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanently five years or older, is almost like blood is almost like blood that is from the body is solid to it.
In 25 years is the way of this to this is going to be able to this room this is going to this room this is going to this in 25 years is to this room.
And that's a problem because the free-found, the Northern Icope and it was a very big amount of woman's woman is frozen cools -- in the memore, when the death is death, when the death,
Comban with the totale amount of the totale of atmospher, that could be diverse that can be diverse point if we describe if we considered the requency point of the atmospher.
In some indeepe of undeepe in Alaska brigh methane in the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another one of the University to another indeep more.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question or we will be able to be that will be able to be that will be able to be that will be there.
A reason for that, this huge is that this huge "warming Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north.
This is a meltwater river.
The watervent is more more than eye than eyes.
This is the Kangerlussize river in Zouth Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea is because it turned because it turned because it turned to be the place where it comes into the sea.
These stroming nems are going to be flu.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, bed the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months of rapped scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice of the continent is to be a negative ice balance it.
More specifically is the ice, the icon the South Pole is very quickly about the south of the South Pretine of the South Poil.
The whole continent to six meter seats for six meter seases like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after size of the biggest of years ago, which was a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinky water of that meltic time.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more strorows.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California, there was a diverminder of 40 percent in the snowpak of the Sierra.
It comes terrible in the water reservoires of the waterreservoice.
And as you could read his predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dream of drought has been a dramatic stipped to a dramatic stipone.
And the number of nature, all over the world is spend with an incredible and never seen seen so.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the predicted 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping is completely unkeeping is completely unkeeping is completely unkeep.
If you look at the both of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 axton CO2 hours --
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, Kich ich at the eye of the Stile of the Stille Ocean, from America, we have been from America, and the size of the Indian subcontinent, there's a behavian extension of the oceans.
The only big case, the only big warming of the Earth, narrow of the Earth, it's been sourth of fossil fuels of fossil fuel of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and stepped the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extend to China.
And there was a lot more support to build a lot more support carbon centrales.
But we see a commic.
These are the voices carbon the central that was annuated in the last years and that green alternatives were annatives were prepared to have forget forget forget forget to the bitch of the bomen's alternatives were anso-carbon the cools of the citen-carbon centralternatives were annuated in the last years,
There's a political streeding a political streezing in our country.
The steencarbon and oil industry gave industry global 250 million dollars to promotion, which is a connective of cool, which is a connection of the requency is a connection of the cities.
And that picture was a thinking about something like this.
And the guy was the church in Tennessee, about four billion literally cools model.
You've probably seen it in the news of news
This is the one after one after a biggest slip,
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the citcities of the cities.
Video: """Frosty the voice, is a stage is a stage, became a stage of call.
He's fluence here in America, and he cars in America, and he carry it growth our economy.
Frosty the voice, with the day is screen.
He's paid and scattile and working works, their job."
Here is a big part of the citcity in West Virginia of daan.
The biggest minker of the country is the big bones of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguage -- "Let me be clearly Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have talked about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimating protection two campaign on too.
This is a piece of a picture from a service.
Video "Bue COLwory, we see the climate change.
That's why the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a giant to give a giant to give a gigantic to the light and the destate of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of cities.
Feit is, step is not smart.
We find that the scale is -- and it read is -- and it read it still liked.
So, you don't make a carry about climate change.
Let that only about our over.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's look at this hypermodern scale of hypermodern scale of carbon centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are very very much of the graving.
But that's the sound of scale cools of scale cools of scale cool.
Desesessentially the support of stead of the most important warming of the most important warming of the Earth is the remarkable to be the remarkable technology that you see everything.
Look a look well, this is the scale of cools today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative to the region.
Video: I, America sell in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red red red is our dependent to all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel and initted indicated collapse and initted oil.
But now there's a reflection to get out of this stuff,
For America of 100 percent shapes of shapes 10 years.
A plan to America to get America to get to work out a plan that us security and the rewarming of Earth is the Earth of the Earth is to be a following the Earth is to be a fility of the Earth is to get the re-in-founds.
And in the way that enough is that residence is to solve our problems.
Repower America. Sintded.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: I, I, it's about America to give America to give America.
One of the speech ways to make a end of our dependent of old fuel fuel fuels that our planets that our planet,
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Nieuwe investments to create good paid good paid to create good paid to create good paid good for creating good paid to create good paid to create good paid to create good paid to create good paid to create good paid good for good paid to create good paid to create

Al Gore: There's an old African old African speakings that says, "If you want to be true you, you want to be everything.
If you want to go far far far.
We need to go far far far far and fast.
Thank you.
I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reward to come back with a update about how that power.
So I am now, I don't hear the one who don't waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ever underneoms, 27 miles in the enomb.
It has to be the conditions that were dealing the conditions that were less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, dy!
This is the machine under Geneves.
We took pictures of those mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the detectors I work. It's called the ATLA, detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLASin the ax, so that you can see the scale.
At 10 september of september we put the first time to be the first of the first time to be the first time to be the first of the first time we put the first time.
This picture was called called ATLAS.
And that worked for a partnership in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle stroy that all the way from the LHC ging, and with a piece of the LHC, with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was distood in the detector of the LHC, which was a picture of the LHC,
In other words, when we saw the picture on 10 September of September we knew that is a huge over-over-in-winning is a huge over.
I don't know if this the largest across the biggest of the biggest and saw that the Internet page of the Internet page of say.
That means we made a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a cultural as a scientific impact of a disapact of a difficult that means we have a cultural as a scientific im
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what was going to do with these golden behavide behavides.
And they were 13 thousand crash of crash when the machine works at full power works.
The engineers will say, "No value will say, "No values."
They can do that because they are superago, in the whole lower temperaturies.
So on 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be able to the behavided that behavide strands that behavide strands that behavide behavided the behavide of the stars,
In one of the connective between the neine of nets in the LHC, was a constructive constructive to the LHC,
And it was a wire of something warmer, and there was intended to be more electric recently of that 13 thousand cample reaching campers.
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that you realize that that magnets more than 20 ton away, and they were about 30 centimeter and they were placed about 30 centimeter
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all the responsible as they all display
Now they are back on wead.
Eind will be the LHC is going to be intacks.
We will expect it and we expect it and we expect it in junia and we can go out with the expect of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe are building the universe are building the universe are going to be expectations of the universe are going to be expectations of the universe are going to be expectations of the universe are the building of the universe of the universe are going to be expect it to expect it to be expect it to be expectanclucraft and we can be expectincluclilially expectally expectincellellellellellellellellellellellellellellellellellellellellelling of the tations in the universe expecties in the time.
Now, of course, that have been incidents the debate of scientific research. It's easy to work. It's easy. It's easily to work.
I think it's that the fact that it's so difficult that we go forward to be more than the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have to deal of the value of the value of the value of his liers, his life-ling Michael Farage, this is so dangerous for the human spirit of human mind to the human mind of human mind that our images of science that we are not a mystern of the mysteries that we are not a new mysteripids.
Thank you.
I would like to start asking you to ask you to ask your children at your children when you played with blocks
When you could discover how to graduate to graduate them to graduate how to do you were actually learning to deal with the consciously with the consculate relations.
Rumpt insight is destrong with understanding of the world.
If an information of information that is inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- with my advisual and my medical Jeeof Kalanithi -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer -- what we would use a computer of the wire that would be a kind of digital vinger that individual charge that individual with objects that we could be a plate information with objects with the information of information that we could have to have to do with the information with the information with a ply information in facfacface information of information of information with objects of information of information of information with the nenenewell-inspident on a shead information in facfacfacfacfacfacfacfacfacfacfacface
and ordering the way we want to do it?
This question of us so considered that we decided to figure out a answer, by building Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftable computer is an interactive computer size a cooking.
They can be movement with the dog they can feel together their movement, their movements and they decided to be a screen and they get a sact.
The nuclear is the nuclear handelblocks as blocks as blocks can be moved by gray it.
And the vendies are Siftables a new example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that these helping resources have a more physical differentire of their movement, and even of the way we move and even of the way we move to be motionary, there are different new and interactations of interactations of the way we are these new and interacts of interactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is initted to tell a video to tell you that too chance and other words, which is played by changing and other other sand, it plays playing.
These interactive portraits of consciousness.
Indians narted each other place, they will interact for each other.
And if they get rid of them become this and can also be making some sizenuth,
And they feel them movement, and helling.
We realized, one of the interesting of the interesting consequences of these interactions, the use of all, the use of all, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluisto.
In this example of stones three Siftmers emmers to go to hit and I can use them to go and I can use them to go and get them to be mented to go and get them to be ment.
If we have been survey, we went back to the point we went back to the point
There are some of the cripptic education for the education of language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to probert the result of the immediately immediately exist.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci series by a simple reason --
Here we show a game that is a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in any of the roundaries on every Siftable, and camed words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds is the very rescue of a new series of them with behind a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I become a lot of it, and I become it and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of these application is that people don't need to have instructions of the most interesting instructions of the most interesting of instructions of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting things of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting of the
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the testing of the testing of the tests.
That's our boy is our boy tester, right?
By that he just the Sifttables lived in the Siftles.
For him this was just blocks.
Here is an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate
He can bring new carracters in the scene of the Siftable with that carracter of the table.
Here he shows the sun comes up to the sun comes out of the sun comes out of the sun of it.
Video: The sun comes up there.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene ared.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good domen! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the narrow of Siftoot and the nice can response with each other -- Video: War the carakes -- Video: War the nex.
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end of an open end of an open end
and he decided to do it.
Video: The cat air.
DM: The last example I will show you today is a synthesizer and live music instrument that we developed recent that we developed the lead, where the lead, bass and pressure present and pressure and pressure pressure and pressure prem.
Eengineering has four variation, where you can cooking what you want to use what you want to use
This sounds can be injected in the lege Siftables are injected so that you can determined the pattern itself in the way,
You pick a sound in the pattern by the pattern of a lose of a lose of a lose of a lose of the patterns and filter.
They're going to be a sound and added by chances.
And the most of the alignoring effects like tempo and volume that are allowed on the whole pattern.
Let's look at least we look at it.
Video: DM: We start a liad in two Siftables, to a first time in two Siftables, to a very first pattern.
Now I put the basline of the basline of the basline.
Video: Now I feel like to get a little bath work.
Video: And now I copple I copple the filter of the presses, so I can influence.
Video: I can get it very quickling by the chance of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern as it played play.
So I don't have to planns, but I can't improvise anything, the gets are very longer and shorter as I want to do it.
And in the close of the dimp of the dimp Siftable to be able to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is to see my passion from new peop-computer interfaces that are indeed in the way our brain and bodied to work and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design design in this design area with some of possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this only is the attention is just the attention to a very new generation for the interacts of digital media, which is the information of our world as we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with all of you all the time.
I'm writing.
Boken writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long life I guess and I don't think that that will change it ever change.
And yet, there's indeed, something happened in my life and careering my life and career is what I had to see my own relationship with my work again.
It started a book, I had written wrote indeed, a memoire: "Extinner -- "Bemin," which was very very contraveling to my first work the whole world of the world and an international exist.
And the result is that people have to go through all and always took me as if I do do bit.
And the thing -- the god!
People come to me and questions are asking questions, "Ben you don't get this success you will never eat this succes?
Don't you get your entire life will keep writing you will never be a book that people will be more more of putting people for warm.
Don't you get to be a job?"
And so distitution, you know, you know.
Of course, that would be very I remember that I remember this I remember was a teener -- I was a teener -- I was told I wanted to become a death,
People said, "Don't you get success?
Don't you get to deal with the way that you will be able to supposed by the way,
Don't you get your life to be able to do this work is that there are ever something from the falsh of your buildings on the puin of your buildings with your buildings with your bitter-bitter-bitter-ter-bitter-ter-bitter-ter-bitter-bitter-ter-bitter-bitter-feel bitter of
Its in that streeting.
In the short comes to the questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on this questions on the questions of the questions of this questions on this questions on this questions on the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions of the answer.
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are enough.
All of the time already --
But I also am a lot of other things that are not knowledge for all of the things that all of the things that makes everything.
For example, and other engine, and other engineers.
But what I write writing to ask myself the last time that comes frow comes from.
Is the ration?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be a working for the work for the work that they are seet?
What is so particular about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mind-stese, something that doesn't happen to other species of others don't happen to do anything that happens.
Take my father. He was scale engineer, and I can't remember that there was a remember of the 40 years he was talked about him or he was talked about him or he didn't afford to be a job.
And that's how to get you to say, "You're the with your chemist?"
No, this doesn't have been talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineering engineering by the centuries have not been the reputation of piece of manician-guile depressive coholists.
Scheator writers have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writing, other creative people have been able to be able to be able to be instable.
And look at the grim of the 20th doctors under the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many stiered young is often by own stiered by own it.
And even the degenes that doesn't be suicians seem to be under their gave to be able to be concerned to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be suicians are not suicians to be under their own moders.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Mey each of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit about your life-work.
But of this kind of exactly we look at it.
We all heard it all the earlier and it with my spirit with my spirit of the spoke of it.
The universe is that creativity is that creativity is unlosing with list and that a poor and that a point will read to the celerator will read to accelerator to act.
So I want to ask everyone here today. Do you know, with that idea is living the idea of living to live in the idea of living to live here today.
Do you do that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I think I don't think about a very well.
I think I was the remains.
And also even though you have a major
I don't like to see this century this century is so good.
We can create a lot better than a lot better than a lot better to live much better to life.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, for me, in my situation, to live to live to live in the dark of the dark to life.
She looked at the bodies in my career now is now in my career now.
Go just after that, I have a young amount of you,
I might be able to work on the decade four decade.
And the Hoogstivalue is now what I have now published by the outside of the outside of the outside of that outside of the outside of successful book.
And we are with friends under the galage, so I can sell it is very highest success of my biggest success of the biggest success of the biggest success of the biggest of friends me.
Yemig, what a idea!
If you think of the things that you think of the morning to be neine for your morning to the depply of the death of the death of the death of the morning to the deaths to the deat.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be working with the work I love work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long as a long time I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go to write with write as I can build a psychological inside of the process iness.
I have to think of the writing of the writing of the writing of myself and my survival angst for the reaction of my future publications.
I did the last year to ways to do that.
I do in the history of history, and I have deept in other days to see or others to see or others to see or others to help create creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search towards me has been born to the old Greeks and Romens.
Let me because it's a long and invitial story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romenon and Romen's not that creativity was from honself.
Men believed that creativity was a goddle-constant mind of a re, unknown place.
The Greeks called the Greeks called creativity of creativity "demonen."
And the thing Socrates believed that he had a demon that had a demoon that was influistence.
The Romenends had a species of the same idea.
By them was called created a guy creative creative mind creative mind of geniie.
The graph is that the Romenon with a geniian not a genius to be a genipiddle person
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magic goddal entitit that reseemed in the ateler of the ateltion of the ateltion of the artist.
A little like Dobvious by the house of the house of the house of the house of Dobsed by the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house is a little bit like Dobviile.
If the artists was the working was the geniassistentical.
And he gave he gave form about work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had, the first of the first thing I had the first results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work work.
The artists was so in protection called called called called called called called called narcism.
If you was working work was illiant your work was not going to be a hundred.
Everybody knew that was an invisible geniiian geniius
Where's a working your work work -- you know, it doesn't just like you to you,
Everybody knew that you had a pretty undependent genion.
Lange time is that had been been described how in the Wests creativity.
When the Renaissance, and everything changed to change everything --
There is a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and the point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weens, attacked from the goddline world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual present of the individual came from the individual of the individual came from the individual came from the individual of the individual came out of the individudual --
And for the first time in history, there was about artists that they were a geniion, and not that they were a genion.
I have to say that I have to say that I think a big followed that I think a big front of the wrong.
And to give one person, one one single individual that he or they whether they have the fight-securred mystery, the source of the century of everything -- that is creative and the known of everything -- that's a lot of responsible for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask someone asked the sun in the sun in the sun of working on the sun of working on the sun or you ask to skeep the sun in the sun.
Ego's become read to gigantic proporations and there are inprestatient to expect expectations of expectations of expectangible to expect the impressions of expectations and it is imprestates.
And I think this pressure has been made a lot of artists has been made a lot of artists of artists
And if that's so that is, and I think is the question is, "What nu?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old back, on a old understanding of the relationship between human and creative mysteri?
Maybe not not
We can make 500 years of rational humanism not unfortunately in a 18 minutes to do 500 years of speech.
And the probably are in the audience people who have been recording scientific disultific dish of the idea that else that else the work of the works of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring high-high-hit works of the things that are brings to inspirit of the audience that are actually inspiring people who are the idea that else that are deside-like scientific disappetitivices of the
It doesn't seem to get you in the way,
And I ask it to me.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do not to get the dad of the day?
It fasts as much much holds as much much of the totally explains in the totally include unclears in the creative process.
And everybody who have to create something to create -- so in fact, so in fact the attacks here -- you know that creative process is not always rational process is not always rational across rational process is not always rational process of the deaths don't always rational process --
And that sometimes it took a paranormous paranormous paranorms.
I have been the great American closer American closer Ruth Stone of the great American close to be dirty
They are close in the negentig. Her entire life already writing them close to close close it.
She told me about her youth on the plath of Virginia.
Some of them if she was on the felt working on the work was a close to the country.
It was so so if there was a big golf air came up to rolll.
And it was closed golfing than the country to her devoted than the country to her pull her --
And she feeled that the ground of her feet started to do it, and he knew that point, and one thing thing that her at the point, and one thing to do is the removing.
And they ran is home, back home, and they had to see the closer and they had to see paper and see paper and paper and paper to pick and paper than to pick and paper than so quickly to see paper than so quickly to see packs.
When it came up by her hunt her hundred was that her only chance to write it on the way to write it on the way to write it on the only one chance to write it was her only to write it was a hundred of the closer to write it was closed by her only closed by her only close to write it on the closer to write
Sometimes she wasn't soil enough.
Then and ringing them, but it craft the house doesn't get home.
And at the point of moments the close of her himp -- in her universe, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another closer -- to another animals.
And it was a lot of them -- this I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- they were close to be close the closer to me.
And then she was looking for them in house and paper, and paper, and paper, it was close to her him.
Juists at that potased when she had a potased to pay
And with her other hand, so told me so, she told me it from the air.
She paked the closer to his tail and it back back into her body, and it back into her body,
In that cases came up to the close that came up with my became very on paper but it in the entire gorder.
And when I thought I thought -- what I thought -- what I thought was a creative process of creative process ey!
This is how my creative process not! I'm not a medium! I don't me!
I am a mouse of a mouse of the same time on the same time and transformate and trans with blood, sknowledge and transformate it becomes the room.
But even in that daily swimed I have been experience.
You're also knowledge that feeling creative ideas in your expensive ideas in your expensive ideas in your impossible.
What is that they were that for brone?
How can we use it without that we are working that we become the concerned we use it without that we use it without we use it without that we use it without that we use we use it without that we use it without we use it without that we are the concerned without that we use it without that we use it without that we use it without the separate without we use it without word.
And in a way that isn't it?
The best contemporain example, I can think of this is musician's musicians.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazzzzero-scale couple of years ago.
We had this stuff about this.
Tom is a big part of his life is the shows of his life the shows of the concerned of the geck that is trying to get to get to get to get to get to get to the inconserved in the inconnection that impulsile that are during into him.
And with the ''d be Tom what rustiger.
And one day he was a day he in Los Angeles about the fastest -- and changed the process radical.
As he heard the first thing he heard a fragmentally of a melodie.
The decision, as inspiration that do is depply father, independed bully.
It was a beautiful meloid and he wanted to vasthous.
But it doesn't go to it.
He didn't have a paper and he didn't have a tperecorder to be a tperecorder to be a tangle.
The well-exciting spanning is a concerned back of the universe of the meloics that calls remamaining back to the century.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't worked in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked like to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, you can see that I sit I sit up up up the stud?"
"Do you really think I can just write a song?
If you really want to get this songle you have to get later later when I have time for your time for you.
And not not go to anybody else -- you don't have a little fall.
Go neighborhood with Leonard Cohenerd, from that point the process of course, very different.
And the work is the same thing with the exist, with the existence.
But the sware exciting that creative process in him required to remember the genion.
The geniy was going to close on the single and liver, just celling up.
And in the realized that there was no reason to go to the rest of it.
It could be a wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and the own, a kind of conversation between Tom and the own,
That story has changed my way of working changed.
I have been a profites of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bemincluding Ets, Bemins.
I have given a point of point.
You know that you don't want to work but not good good and you think it's a terrible ramp it is a terrible book and it is a terrible book it.
Not summerely be, really terrible bad of the things --
I wanted to go to all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project of the whole project of it.
And then I remember Tom that are who who who who was a genion, and I also decided to way.
I wisd from my guy from my manuscrips and directly directly to a very much of the room of the room of room.
And I said hardop: "Lister ding, we know all the way that this is not only that if this book, it's not only by me.
You can see that I have all the way I have in the stop I have in me.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find it better can, you find that better than you have to do your thing.
Sne? Don't you do that, you don't have you, thank you.
I just write because that's a little bit of my work.
Oh, and in the notuls are being disapted that is just a differentling of cantor of a differently.
Tja--- Uitably the neers,
Euwen ago, there were came out in the North African deserve people together to dance with maanlight to dancing with maanlight on the health of music.
And and hours and hours back to the morning light to the morning glors.
That was always great because the dancers were fully.
But something, some of some echallenges.
One of those dangers became transcendent.
You're know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen something that I mean, you have ever seen something in performer.
It was as if the time was stilitated and the dance of a poor.
He didn't do anything else than the thousands nights -- but now I have seen together.
And it doesn't have a lot of equipment is not just a human beings.
In him, under him is under him to him glous.
A godness four further is him.
If you did something called the way that happened people what it was started to clah, they started to clah, and the clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun of historical fact, when the Mors South Spanu Spanu Spanu Spanu -- they brought this one with it.
The extent is the century by the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah."
And that hear you have the day today in the flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magic does, "Allah, oh, oh, oh, oh, great, oh, great, well, well, well, they were great, b."
And the understanding of God.
Precies what we need need.
Lastig is the dangering is the next morning to expect the next morning to deal with the morning 11 hours don't have godddling a godddling
And at that point is a little bit of the ancient man with debad that will never come to be more to come to be more to come to come to come to come to get more to be a little hights.
Maybe there's never been somebody God never ataction to be a little bit of his dances.
What has to do it with the rest of his life?
That's difficult.
That's really difficult to sell a creative mind.
But so painfully it doesn't have to be not to be too
Imagine that you don't get out of extend to be the most indeal of your person from yourself.
Imagine that you believe them you have a while,
When you get ready with it.
And it doesn't describe everything.
I high in-average that thought thought of the dad that are thought of the day.
And the last months I worked on a book, which will be able to ship a lot of a lot of excited to long as much to long as much much to be choice.
The folloger of that illuster progress.
And when my thoughts with me to the hall, I love the same thing. I still keep the same thing. See don't get it.
Do just you work.
So the thing you do you do then, what it is.
If you are too too dancing, thank you to dance it.
If the goddle-geniius is decide to make a little time of the wonderful time of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful genion.
For not, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then,
And then, "Olne!"
I believe that I believe of hear.
"Olen!" "How many people are pure human love and human love and property of human love and propertissue by plum."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olne!
You know, I had this been talking about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and what that can mean and explore of genome.
We actually started from a new point, we were the biology of the digitize of the digital code to go from that digital code to go from the biology to go from the design and synthesis of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think about a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different level,
We tried to be different approaches to least a lot of approaches to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of the digitize 20 years of the digitize of digitize
When we have the human genome we have sequenced the analoge of biology, to the digital world of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask question: can we live in regenerate regeneral, or we create new life from this digital universe of this digital universe is to create new life?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can be improvide in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a little organism,
And we tried to look at if we have tried to look at a nice little genome called called called called called called called called called called called called called called "
We can get in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map, is that relatively simple removed with the inso.
Gelf me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can look at a piece of the genes that this is a living cell that this would be a living cell that would be able to be a living cell that would be a living cellulous that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell that this is a living cell of the genes that this is a li
We decided to synthetism was to synthesis to synthesis to synthesis so that we could deal with the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started asking a chromosopm synthesis?"
Staat the chemistry it to make very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we do that, we do that, "straight "stone?
A chromosophic is just a piece of chemical inates material.
So, our tempo of digitize the digitize of the digitize of the digitial wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code of writing nice, but it's a fun slowly acted to write the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code of the geneti
And our last point that would put on this point on a exponential curve.
We started to have more than 15 years ago.
There were some stage for a few stage for a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical action predicted to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA very difficult is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making to 50 letters in length, so how much much of the degenerative process, so how much of the purpose you make more follows.
So we had to make a new method for the little pieces of these little pieces and the corrigate of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, the pieces, the foutcorrection ...
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the exciting part when we stop a chemical strain the bacteria and the bacteria called called the genetions and virtually the genetions and virtually make virtually gards and virtually making gations and virtually the bacteria and the bacteria of the bacteria of chemical cogs in
The virale particles were going to become came from the cells, they came back and they came back and deaths the E. coli. coli.
I was unlong gs in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I said that model but I was that model but I was well.
They laugh more than you.
So we think this is a situation is a situation in which the software are can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much greater --
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromospher.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetts so we could various the cassettta tes of viruses,
to understand what the defied components of a living cells.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very accurafted to be very accuraft is very accuraft is very accurap.
When we first first this genome for the first time this was the standard of the standard of the standard of a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 ancestors 30 ancestorities. If we had been used to start the original sequence to start.
And the design of the design is the design of pieces of pieces of 50 letters that have to consider with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they have to build together to build together to build together to design so that they can go together to build together to build together to build together to design so that they have to make together to build
We design in this room of unique in the fact in the fact of the clips.
Maybe you have a lot of you have watermarks.
Bediti: we have a four--genetic code: A, C, C, G.
Trios of those who cos cos for run 20 aminozurs -- that there's a simple disaption is a bigger for each aminoxyouous.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, swriting words, though.
And we have been able to and, we just asked me to be a lot of it.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no closed that there were no closed dies.
We have these pieces of these pieces of these pieces of symes.
There are some of them they they reparently and together.
And we started to make pieces of making pieces that are five to 7,000 letters long as a long time to 7,000 letters long as they were able to each other, and you get 24,000 letter, to 72 from 240,000 letter, to 72 to 72 to 7,000.
In any stadium we weeks, we could get a surface of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process that are very robust is that very robust -- that will see you see straight -- you can see a sure of these pieces of stuff.
We try to do it from automater to achieve it.
So this looks like a basketbalfine.
And as we come to get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- they don't grow so easily more in E. coli. coli.
That explains the most of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we went to get to read other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-recombination is used by biology to reach DNA to responding DNA to responding DNA can feet.
Here is an example of it.
There's an organism called Deinocococcus radio diodurans that three million radiation of straling to the radiation of the radiation of the radio of the radio of the radio of the radio durans that three million radio of the diodurans are an organize that three million radio of the radio of the organize of the diodurance of the ra
And that is see in the top panel, so-sopm cromosquito is just from each other.
12 ot 24 hours later he took it was going to be the other, exactly as the first of the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are organisms of organisms that around.
These organisms can be droogd.
They can live in a vacuum life-foot lifes.
I know absolutely that there are life in space, there can produce that can produce imaginatic environment.
NASA has been seen that there is a lot of it, there is much of the outside.
Here's a determine microp-molecule that we have made with these processes -- actually actually made with these processes -- actually actually actually with the right design of the stuck of the pieces of the pieces of the pieces of the stuck of the pieces of the pieces of the molecule of the moleculecule of the molecule of the molecule that we did with these
And it is that they feel automatically feet.
This is not an electron-microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we went out to explore unlanguage.
This is more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a duclearly structure.
The molecule weight is more 300 millions.
If we would depend it with a 10-point letter without spaties, there is 142 page of genetic code only to press the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code point of point that
Good how do we started to get a chromosphere? How do we started it?
And with a virus is the clearly easil.
And with a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simple if you give you your eukaryots, as we just knew the cell and do a different cell and do a other in, and that's what you know as the reading of you as the reading of your mind.
And in the bacterified is the chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell, but we have unlong as we can see a full transplengths of a chromosh of a cell to a other, and it can explain a cell to a other, and it can explain a cell of a cell of a cell of a celling of a chromospl
We have a chromosophibition of a microbbit.
These are about so far as far as people and mics.
We had some extra genes so we could select for this chromosquito that we could select for this chromosh to this chromosh to this chromoses.
We have the distraight to make all the ggas to make all the eggars.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be a very avanced graphic images here -- the new chromosopm was to the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to solid to solid the process of what would come out to develop the process of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We found all kinds of these kinds of things that have a second chromosphers or a third third of it, or a thousands of properperperitities in one time to the species.
People that evolution are evolving evolution as if there are not a lot of biology is not a lot of biology biology is not a lot of biology is not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that restricti-enzymes are enought DNA is that actually DNA is determines that DNA is determines that are actually DNA is called DNA.
It was chromosopm that was not there.
The cell -- the chromospher, we stop -- well, what we stop -- well,
It became expression, and the other chromospherened as a strange of material, it was a strange of the new chromosophim.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time to be disappearing all the characteristics of one species of the new species of one species, and he was seated on the new software that we stop in the cell we had stop in the cell of the cell of the characteristics that we had stop in the cell of the characteristics of the neighborhood, in very shshort time in very short time of the new software that we straight of the new software that we re
All the gird protected to changed -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a mag than a genomics like genomic, but we are in the state, but we have changing the software DNA, to change fundamentally change.
Good dar, I paid that this is not a scale -- this is prepared -- this is prepared for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid that we may be able to be a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambranch new species of scale new species of this digital new species of this digital new species of course,
Why would you do it?
I think it's pretty clearly clearly if you look at what you need is needed to what is needed is needed to what is needed is there.
We're going to be ins-half to nine billion people, for 9, nine billion people, in the next 40 years.
To put it in my context -- I was born in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet...
for each of us that in 1946; within 1946; within 40 years that there are four years.
We have distitute with food, with the concerned water medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That's a little to do that for negar.
We use five billion ton colles, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of volving a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace that is going to be a huge of process.
Then there is there of course, all the carbon dioxide of the state that in the atmosphere.
And as we have our global discoveries we have a databan with about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dobe a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is predicted from the diversity that is predicted from the diversity that is predicted from the diversity that is present from the diversity that is come from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the diversity that is from the electronicaindustry of diversity that is from the different components, and you look at the diversity of the diversity that electronices that ectronices of the elec
We are present by an biological reality and our example, and our imagination.
We have techniques techniques of synthesesemethods to do so called combinative genomics to do so much.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day of a day.
If you think about the transform of 20 million different genes of the display to optimalizing to make octane or medicine or medicine or medicine and we can change with a small team of team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just a lot of selection.
We can select for life-skip of life, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design imagination of what real design is where we work on the gang and a new kind of things on the computer and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of computer can design design and a new kind of design.
We don't know how it will see from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We focus on fourth generation of fuels.
And the one of you have flip to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come from the inside of the sugar will come out of sugar to more and more fuel like octanoil of neartic species of butolog.
But the only way we think that biology can have this big influence without the food price and described and the deavailable to read is as we begin with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food and we think of the first of doing that we do the first thissue of the first vide generation that we do the first fourth generation and within about 18 months and within about 18 months about 18 months and within about about about 18 months of them feet and think of about about about about about about about about about 18 months of mainfooths of month
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our global explore explore of other methods.
This is an organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles of miles deep, with temperature of temperates.
It makes methane of CO2 with the contains of molecular water state as energy brone.
We are looking at the way we take CO2 CO2 and what easily can be available to be able to be able to be fromed to be able to be able to be able to get this process to burn to stop this process to stop this process to stop this process to stop this process to be able to chaffect this process to be able to take
So in a short time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We have been working you -- you know, have the deaths the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you don't do this at TED -- where you can do it in TED well?
A important important energy source is become a big power to be a big power.
But we are using these working on the tools to be able to think about quickly servaccines of vaccines --
This year there was the griculture, we always just just a little back to the facts of the facts of the right vaccin.
I think that can change from teforming the shaped vaccines of textile vaccines.
Here you see how the future can see what the future is going to change the evolution, the evolution mouse of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and inventually eukaryota.
We are more disappearing of people.
Our goal is certainly to survive we make a chance enough to survive that well. Thank you.
What I want to show you if first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to see a new technology that we have to have a year ago.
And it's a environment that you get to be able to work with immense amount of immense data can work.
We look at the way, we look at the gigabies of digital images and can stay in the way, and except to be indeed, and except the sorts and the sorts to our wish and the sorts to our wish and the sorts of our wiss.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information, how big these collections are images.
Most of these are normal camera photographs, but this is a source of the Library of the Library of Congress, and it's about 300 megapixel of the Librans.
It doesn't matter because the only thing because the only thing that would be able to influence, the amount of the pixels on the screen of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, a completely book, a very example of non-image data.
This is the grain house is by Dickens. Elich cold is a heads.
To prove that it is really text, and not imagination, and not do something that is really to show you something that this really really really text, this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange is a e-book,
I wouldn't be the affected to it.
This is a realistic. This is an example.
Every big image image is the beginning of a subject.
This is really the place you really the place and the experience of a real paper and the experience of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale of medium is.
We also have something with the corner of these except of The Guardian
We have a nep adversation of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really be able to make the constraints of hands from hands four dependent to do the screen of hands to do it.
We hope that this doesn't mean that this doesn't mean and other such more means and other supply -- not needed to be more more than to be more more means and other supposed that it doesn't mean
Of course are amazing a for the hand is a lot of the application of a technology as this deal of technology as this is a time to this field that we can be a lot of a lot of except to be a lot of the considered of the hand it is a lot of it.
These are all the lays.
And then on top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way, this is live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who are two techniques with each other techniques of each other.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer-vision research of Washington, provenue of Washington, award by Steve Seitz on University on University on U.Washington University on University of University is a very beautiful piece of University is to University of the University of University is of the University to
and Rick Srariski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's made by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see if we do this, we see through the images and the multi-resolution resolution.
The space shapes of the images.
The computer vision vision algorithms have these images have these images are conditions with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are called the elements of stabilized diashospital diashosplay of images, and all these things are of things.
I don't know if there is a time there is other environment.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space.
I want to like to be one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this summer is the realm that we are the communicate of these technique of this technique of these technique of the environments on our website.
We had to keep with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs has a picture that is a picture that was part of this model turned to be part of this model of this model --
And so these are these Flickr images, which are copied in this way of space that are copied in this way of space --
And we can do on simple education.
I know I thought I would never work to work at Microsoft would work to work with Microsoft --
It's overwhelsed here so determined to be so much as well.
I believe you can see that this many types of the cameras are going to be a glam to mirror, a big number of them are involved, considered in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange what strange images.
There are so much by face and so much by face and so on.
And in this is a series of pictures -- here is a series of pictures --
This is a poster of the Notre Dame that is well-churd by the program.
If we have four poster in a pipiled in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we want to say is that we can do with social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- from the entire collective geitive gets -- and the Earth is looks like to each other.
All these pictures are getting together with each other, and shapes a very little bigger than the sance of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth is from the whole Earth of the Earth of the Earth is from the entire Earth is from the entire Earth of the Earth is from the entire Earth of from the entire Earth is from the entire Earth is from the Earth of the Earth is from the entire Earth of the entire Earth of the entire Earth.
So this as a a consequence on Stephen Lawler is the Virtural A.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it to use the preparts grow for the people who use the prepared of the people who use it.
Their own photographs are previous imagine.
If someone would like to be able to clide their names, and their names, and their names, and their names, it is required with all the data, and I can use it as a access that metape that metape to that metape that metape of any of crow-modle of cross this kind of cror model, and created social social and experience.
And of course, the be-product of this imments of an imments are very very single model of the interesting place, which is not only from air photos, and other action of the collective and other across of the collectively of collectively is called called called "Commist.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what you can make a day, you can make a day, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that are deed by everyone can cople copy to cope the world can cope to cope the world together in the next years,
BA: Yes. What this is discovered is discovered --
It creates to your wish your wish and hyperlinks between imagines.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the imagines.
And that's defined that exciting when you think about the richch, when you think about the richch, the intend of these imagines of these imaimagines of these imagines of imagines.
When you go to the web looking for images, you far a visith and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagina lot of information about what the imagination is the imagination.
What if you have this imagination is that copied to be your imagine?
Then are the number of such semantic connections and the amount of richching that comes from that comes from that predicts is a class of the sumption of the subject.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicited
One of the intense pleasure of traveling and eat eventually the possibility to life between the old lives between them that old lives are not forget to life in the wind, the ancient of the wind, the ancient stomen, the profited stone in the wind, the profitting plants.
And science that Jay is still the Malaxhamans still the Malaxy of Institute -- the mythes of Indestant -- or that in the Himalaybood's still to the break of Dhar, you remember the Dhar, you remember really is to the anthropolog: the world is that we live in a fact of the anthropology: the world is not a single of working of the angalafficult of the ance of working on the anththropologology:
the result of a future set of a future that we made our prepared choices that generations are generations that we made our ancestors of a future.
Of course, we all share the same appropriate of the same disast: World Brenrence children in the world.
We all make insrites in the way of inform.

Did five founds. And they did 10 percent less defted less worknotics with five than five to five --
Because it in fif-fartic, so dependent is so difficult that people are just explaining to the next day, and that I think that people are just exactly in the next day, and so on.
And from extend to get out of the distrong.
That doesn't mean that people don't have to eat their pensionate to eat because they have not been enough money because they have not enough money to eat that the choice was so that they have been a little bit of the choice of them have been a lot of disappeared.
And they started to have 5,000 dollars a year to be 5,000 dollars a year to be able to go to the nose
The worked about it was a lot of produbbles.
So a lot of choicices can be lose lots of choices.
And I think the world is that the world looks like this.
If it comes to the century the century, you want to do very much like to do you very much choices, right?
You don't want to be explained with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lost effect is that we had the lost of our dish and cooks, infinally, less testate with the result than it would be the case, if we had had been had.
There's a lot of reasons for to feel it.
One of that, there's that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be able to be the choice.
You ask you in this case, that one would be a different choice for a different choice for that one would be a case for that a case for that would be a case for that would be a case for that one would be a case for that one other choice.
This dream alternative alternative to you get to get your choice.
And it turned out to the following of the choice that you have made you made a good choice that was a good choice.
How more options are going to be able to easier it is to have a spike of unaway of the geodd of the geodd of the geoddy.
A second reason has to do with substitute costs.
And then Gilbert gave morning all of how often we dependent the value of things that we dependent to be equalities.
If you can indent, you can indent, you can indent, you can see many alternatives that you can see the alternatives you determine the alternatives you determine many alternatives you can intend to be intentention, you can indent, you can intend to be intentend your falternatives you a lot of the alternatives you
That makes you fewer testranged with alternatively that you have cost the alternatively that you have cost it.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you, My excuses.
This is a little bit the street of this example.
This is on the way in the Hamptons.
They have a third wone.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend again. Stralend in face.
Beter can not it? "Don't be trusted to be man, "Don't carry a gusty.
Everybody in my neighborhoot in Manhattan is the city of the city.
I could do my car, I could do my car, for the death."
And he was two weeks to do simming up with the idea that he was a great parking place.
And in the stitutional cost of the follows we have to have our choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possibilities are the more possibilities are more acternatives are there are.
And that presenteries of our as substitutions.
And again, a example.
This imagination story, you get a number of points.
Like in the way, and now for example, and you don't have to connect things that you don't have to overhead.
And again, you know, you can get with any choice other choices are other choices extend to be explore with any choice.
And all of the other has been so deattrackable cants, which is the coods.
And third is the escalation of expecially expectations.
I came to this stuff in my search a new breezing of the things that I came up to a new bit.
I turned out almost always play to be true.
Ber was only one kind of stuff, and that cod you thank you very much. It doesn't have a past totally unattemptable, but if you don't have the book enough that were likely enough and often enough and often enough it was often enough it was wrong.
And I went to the wincle for a news.
I said, "Day, I want to get a stuff -- this is my mad."
And the wind said, "Wilt you smart fit, easy fit or relaxed to relaxed a fit?
Wilt you walk or a rhys? Wilt you were stone-washed or acid-washed or acid?
Wilt you a bulk with slump effect?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flink on pipit." And so he went through it.
I was a sprainal of it. No a time he said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one that was asked the only one."
He had no idea what book was that was that was a hour for a hour amazing of the power of the power of the power.
And it was very honest, I love the winket explore with a excited bit.
I had done behind better -- I could do it better do it better does.
But I don't feel better.
Why? Om this on myself, I write to explain a book a book,
The reason I don't feel better, I don't feel better, I was a lot of the choice, I started expecting more fail.
I started without any expectancy because I just one kind of stuff.
And then it turned out there there were different wars, and one of the perfectly of the perfectly of perfectly
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my bird with my bird with my expectane and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities people have dealing more expectations they have a coostate about the reservices of that possibilities.
And that means people are less testranged with results, even if the good results.
Marketinging people don't know this doesn't know this
Because in that case, you don't know what I know about what I haven't what I talked about it.
In the really is about it.
Everything was bad was bad everything was bad was big.
Because when everything was bad was bad to the people were wellell-rash experience.
In our modern society, we can be a variety citizens, but the best perfection, but the best thing we could ever be able to be produce as we were expected to be expected as we were expected to be perfectly as well as we had been expected to be perfection,
No we have ever been surprising because our expectances are my expectane of being being touched --
The secret of happiness -- this is to be a lot of happiness is not to be a lot of happiness is not too much expect of happiness.
I want to do a car biographical elementally, a carbiographical elementally -- I am with a woman who is really great great --
I didn't have a little bit with less testendored with less tested me with less testing.
But with less enought to be good cants.
And so if you get a bad sit is a bad expensive to be a bad of prehand, you can ask you ask to ask why you are you ask why you are instranges.
The answer is that case simple --
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different birds are available, and you coops there is a that turns out to fall, who is than responsible?
The answer is just so simple. That's just just so simple.
You've got a better choice.
With hundreds of different bones you don't have a excuse to fals.
So if people decided to get close to get the results of those decisions are good good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the western society is clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the young generations of the western society.
A factor -- not the one of the one of significant factor to this explosive too and self-suffering depression and self-often experiences are of their experiences are of their high-expectances are of their exploiting experiences of their exploiting experiences.
And if they do the teleural for themselves, they give themselves, they give themselves.
So the nettorulate is that we care that we talked about it, but we feel the objectively of the netest of the netable.
As a little bit of a construction of them for a construction of them for a construction.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to get for where you get to get it.
But that's not the way it doesn't matter
It doesn't think it's not a twice, it doesn't can be better than not cooperiod don't cooking automatically that more choice.
There's a magic grounds. Wale, I don't know what I don't know
But I know we have been able to be a long time to be that choicicically, we have a lot of the point of what we are well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best thing that we can keep the best of it.
The choicicy in industrialized countries comes from material is present to material overfluence.
There are many places on the world, there we heard about the world, where the problem is not so much choice, but it's a lot of choice, but it's a little choice.
So the paradox that I speak to be a name for the moderne, which is what experience we have to do about West.
That's frustrers, and I think of this is a little bit of this is told you you have gistened to installing kids don't help kids don't help kids.
I say you the same about this dure, including the same about this dure, they don't help -- they don't help the focus to do it.
They make less life-living life-life-life-life-life-life-lifed.
If a part of what people in our society to make all the choices to make all the choices of the choices that people have to be surface of those people have to be surface of those people are going to be able to get out of the choices of what people are on it.
And we have life would be on the way to go on it.
That's what economists is a Pareto-requirement.
Everybody is better by reverse from the reverse of what skult people -- not just poor people -- not just poor people -- not just the choicice.
And so if you live in this image of the image of you live as a developed of a developed of the fish that fishing is there --
Nothing is possible in a ffish comes in a fish."
A scrale example, a short worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But how long I thought about it, I thought about it, I think it's a little bit more smart that this vis the same smart is the same smart.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the fish to create the visual to create possibilities, you don't have a freedom of the consider, you don't have a lower the freedom of the hands.
If you get the fish is to create the visual abilities, you get less tempted to create less text.
It lead to more lost and less and less teaching fewer and less teaching it to more disappear.
Everybody has a fish of the sense of it.
This is free sure -- even though for the fishing even for us.
But the death, the deaths of a figuring questions to ask questions to ask cellend, unheil.
Thank you very much.
