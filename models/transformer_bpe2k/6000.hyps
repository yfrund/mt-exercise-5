Fore year, I was a few years, I think about two dia's set of the pools of the last three million years of the last three million years of the big.
But this is actually the entire of this specific problem because it doesn't see the desert of the ice.
The ice of skin the North pool is in seclimatter in the clopping of us global climate system.
It was going to be in the winter and crimpt in the sizero.
The next found, I shows a square is a version of what the last 25 years is happened 25 years is happened to happen.
And the permanentire of the permanentire in him.
As you see, you see it from dark blaw.
And that's the junnarentire of the winter.
And the crimpt in the sizero.
The soil of the permanentire years or years or years or years or years or blooth, is a blood of the body soil here.
In 25 years is the one of this is the sliped of this is going to be
And that's a problem because the population because the North Ictual IJssee IJsope Icell of the foundation of the womenen's foundation of wombon on deth, by death, by deth, by dethth,
And the totale of the totale of the devicicians in the atmosphere's going to be redubble, that can redubble, if we redubble,
In some of some of the deeper of the deep, in Alaska relationship of the water.
At Professor Katey Walter of the University of the University of Alaska with a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a team to a different of the University of the University of the University of the Universit
Whoo! She's OK. The question is echter or we will be going to be there.
And a reason is that this huge "warming Greenland of the order of the ords of the ords of the ords of the ords of the ords of warms.
This is a smeltwaterriver.
The watervolume is echecherate than it.
This is the Kangerlussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the seespeas because the landips, it's the country, it's the place where the place in the sea.
And these stroms, you take fluence.
At the other side of the planet of the Sidpool, becomes the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the Earth.
At the main the main the continent scientists that the continent now now a negative ive of the entire continent to the whole continent
More specific is the icians in the weast of the South Poidchool very quickly of the waters.
The whole continent for six meter of the continent to meter a lot of the enland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest of the biggest of years ago, which is a few years ago.
40 percent of the worldpopulation is the help of his drinkwater of that smell of the water of that smell of the follow.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinkwater for these city.
There are now more stroces.
But when they refurbs, the drinkate, it also took the drinkwater.
In California was a remindation of 40 percent in the squickkkpak of the Sierra.
It really comes out in the water reservice.
And as you clearly read the predictions are the predictions
This world's dreaming to a bunch of bottoo catch of bosing bosings.
And the number of course of course, is the world with an incredible and never seen a incredible and never seen a quicks.
For more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the 75 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at the better of a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years have 70 million years have 70 million ton CO2 fun to evenue every 24 hours --
25 mics every day in our oceans, Kere, Kook good to the United Stillic buildings from the Stille Oceat every single single of the Indian ent, and every single of the ocean is is a baldomine, is a balth of the oceans.
The only big order of the opportunity of the Earth, of the Earth, which is the front of the global foundation, it's the reflectil branks of phospits.
And it's a problem and steendge of the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest except of the two biggest excams with China.
And there was a progresal to build more cities of cools of building and building it.
But we see a tommeasure.
These are the cities of the cities of the boman was annumber of the last years, and where growing years and where growing the last years.
There's a political stree-free-free-free-side.
The steenkbon and olie-industire gave years of about 250 million dollars to promove to promots, which is a cool of promots, what is is a connect of promovity.
And that image to me something thinking about something like me to do something like me to something think.
And the guys was a little bit of though in Tennessee, about four billion literally cool.
You probably see the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news
This is the one after one after one after the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the biggest of the bigge
This happened around the Kere.
One of the advertising of the advantage of the coopulling the Kerst was deside.
Video: "The clearly is Frosty is a single of cool.
It's about it is flowing a little bit in America, and he takes in America, and he carry in the economy.
Frosty the cities is with the day is with the day.
It's paid and whetily and works.
Here is a large particularly particularly in West Virginia of daan.
The biggest mespecially is the largest of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguguguguguys -- "Let me duce Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rearry Rey, Harry Rey, Harry Re."
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimatter of two campaign campaign on tools.
This is a piece of a little bit of it.
And Video "Bue COL. We see the climate change.
And that's why the reason is why the most important thing to give a gigantally behavior, and the light of the light and the light and the light of the light of the value of the value of the truth of the value.
Feit is not single of course is not smarridge.
And we find it is a scree -- and it's a little bit more life's cooke.
So, you don't make your climate change.
Let that but about us to go.
Video: Acteur: Schonsteends.
So let's look at this hypermodern of these hypermodern cool.
Fantastic! The machines is going to make some lay.
But that's the sound of scene of scenking.
Our dangerous that the fact that the foundation of the most important of the most important ordinary of the warming of the Earth, the surface of the surprpractice that you see here in the surface of the worlds.
Look a good around the scree of the cools of today is the day.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternative to our economic challenge of national foundation.
Video: Stem: At in crisis, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The rock is our things that is our dependence of photograple of purposs, as futtom.
But now there's a during new solution to disation to this is to get to this.
For of 100 percent of 100 percent scene of 100 percent of a year.
And a plan to get America to get to get a plan that is a plan that us and the surface of the warming of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And in a solution of the consider of the problems is to solve our problems on the problems of the problems of it.
Repower of America. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOccck.
Al Gore: And the last last one.
Video: At is about the America is to give America is to feet.
A of the strong ways to make a end of our dependence of old single single of old fun to help us to help help our planet to help help help to help help help to help a end of the square of the flolowing ways of the found.
Man: The future. Wind, health, health, a new energy system
Man is, Nieff 2: Well, you can create good papers to create good papers.
Stem: Repower America. And we have realistic to be realistic
Al Gore: There is a old African an old African is speaking word that says, "If you will go to be everything.
If you want to go to go to do together."
We have to go to go and quickly and quickly and quick.
Thank you.
Fore years I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I required back to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am a little degenes that there are not waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ever education in the environment.
And it has to the environmental to be able to the environmental second than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine of Geneve.
And we took photographers of that less Bangs in detectors in detectors where I work. It's called the ATLAS TLAS TLAS detector -- 44 meter in detector 22 meter.
Spectacular photograph of ATLAS in the scale.
At the 10 years of september of years, we have the first thing for the first thing of the first thing for the first thing
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that are the care in the controllam.
It's a picture of the first particularly particularly around the LHC ging, and with operate the LHC on on on the ck of the LHC, by a piece of the LHC,
And the words, when we saw on 10 September of the depengugue we worked that the machine words, what is is a huge of the point is a huge of
I don't know if you wouldn't be the biggest future, or done to Google and saw that the internetpage pages that the internetpage of things like this.
And that means we have a cultural as a scientific impact is impact with a scientific impact of the scientific impact of a scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the degree of the degree of the environment.
A week later we had a problem with the machine, what had with this golds.
And that behaviors ago 13 thousand of the power of the power works.
The engineers will say, "Niet you say, "Niet value.
They can do because they do superidend his temperaturs.
So on me in 271 degraps, then the space between the garars, that can behaviors that behaviors.
In one of the connect between the needs of thousand magnets in LHC, in a constructify constructift.
And it was the wireless was a black of the intentic wealthough crather than 13 thousand of the thousand call.
This was the result.
This is still inpressure if you realized if you realizing that magnets more than 20 ton weath, and they about 30 centers.
We had to do about 50 months.
We had to try to get them out of the things we did it.
We all have them all the time,
Now they are back to weay.
Eind mouse is going to be the LHC on the LHC on arrace.
We will be able to go and we will be able to metations in your your or the clion, so we can go to the challenge of the building of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe
Now, of course, of course, that insounces the debate of the value of scientific resever. It's easy resed.
And I think it's so hard that is so hard is that we go to go and then the true of things like the LHC.
And I shows the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, moved in the decades of the truth, the decades of his teaching experiments of his left of his teaching Michael was so so that the provided to the human progress of human beings of the world's environments of the images of the imagineering of the imagine that are not going to be rewards of the dedefinding of the world,
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to ask you back to your children to your children when you played with blocks of blows.
When you discovered how you had to move the packs, and they were going to get problems of the teaching of the environments by the environmental relations.
Rut, you know, insight is strong because with the world to understand of the world to understand us to it.
If an inform of the inform of physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- sams with my advision and my advision of the definding of Kalanii -- I began to ask me -- what we would start to ask a computer of the things like a computer of the wire of the things like a follow of the write of the things that we can remove to the conconconconconconfishing of the depensidepenpenpensidepenpenside,
And we can ordering as we want to do you want to do it.
And this question is so so much as we decided to look at a answer, by building the building of the building of Siftables.
Cort together, is a Siftable interactive computer of a cooket of a cooke.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to detect their movement detect and they are a screen and they are free and turn act.
And the guys is the physical treatmental treatmental treatment, as blowing to be able to frow the flowing of the flowing of the physical treatment.
And the focus of the Siftables are a new example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital inforce of digital infortables of digital inform of digital inform for the example of the new ecosystem for the exampample of the ways of digital indisss.
And that these hulp-sense of a more physical differently, are of their movements of their movements and even of the way we move them to move them to move them to discover the other other other other other and discover the other other new and understand the different new and then the other other other other things that we discover the way we have to discover the other other other things that
And I will start with some of a few simple examples.
This Siftable is institute to tell a video to tell you to tell you to tell opportunity and others played to be a catterward and other.
These interactive portravities are going to be able to each other other work.
And Indians will be able to each other, they will be interest for each other.
If they were ringly, they can be able to be able to be what can can be able to be what you can become and what you can become and then it and then they also be able to be able to be able to be what they also can be able to be able to what they also do this and then then they can be able to be a and then they can be able to be bunch and then they can be able to be able to
And they feel movement and helling.
And we realized that one of the interactive, that one of the interactive, the Interternet in the use of these interactive, the use of the interactive, as it was a flowing as it was a flowing of a flow.
In this example, three Siftables of the calls of the birds, I can use small in a lege of good, where they are they going to be able to go to be in a lege of the good.
If we have been thinking about what we go back to the back.
There are some of a cople of possibilities for the education of language, mathematics that we want to give people people to do the mobility things that we want to give people the result things that we want to see the result of the result of the result.
Hay, I think is the development of a Fibonaccess of a simple requipmental require of cally.
So here we show a spel that a cruising between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of a little birds of the Siftable, and then the words are controlling in a wordomban in a wordomb.
After about 30 seconds is the gestraine, and differently a new series of moving movie mobilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion, to the Media Lab, and I am in the suntil to make it out to make it out of a video of it.
They were going to be able to be able to it.
And one of the most interesting things of these futures of these futures is that people have no instructions are no instructions have no instructions are not instructions of these futures.
All of what you have to say "Mooffer."
Here are some other people on the tests.
And that's our both birds.
As he looks like the Siftables well.
For him this was just blow.
Here is a interactive scildering a little silder.
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can cut new carakters in the scene, by the Siftable with that care craping the carakter of the table.
Here he shows the sion.
Video: The son comes up up there.
David Merrill: now he has a tractor in the scene area of building.
Video: The orange of the orange of the orange
Goed daan! Yeah!
Do you can do the scioud of Siftables and the carakters can respond to each other, and then the carakters with each other.
DM: and so are so his story of tell you of him.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with a whole story with a end of end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of a whole story with a whole story of the end of the end of the end of a whole story of the end of a story with a story of end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of end
and he decided to the requips.
Video: The cate.
DM: The last last last example that I will show show show Is a synthesizer and live music and a soundables that we developed a sound of the left product of the lead, as the lead, and presses.
Eengineer, in two variation, where you can be able to be able to use what you want to use your want.
And this sound in the teSiftables are injected so that you can be able to make the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern in the pattern of a lege Siftable effects are living to protect the environmental effects as reverb and movile and movilization of a teach.
They become to a sound to a sound and attention to cancer.
And the general effects as tempo and volume and volume that are fugetting on the whole pattern.
So let's look at it.
Video: DM: We begin to a liad places in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a very first pattern.
And now, I think of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline of the basline
Video: Now, I feel what I feel work.
Video: And now I now now now now now I now the filter of the front of the pull of the effect of the effect of the point of the effect of the pulling the effect of the pull.
Video: I can be a very quickly access by the changed of the tempo bloke.
Video: Now, I can see the filter of the filter of the flolowing of the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can rescree the pattern of the pattern.
And I don't have to be able to planns, but I can't improvisers, it very long and short short and short a little bit of it.
And the end of the dimmp of the dimmp of the volume to left the volume to left the clion.
Thank you.
As you can see see my passion to make my passion of new people, of the interfaces that are the interfaces that are going to be degreater in the way our brain and body working on the brain and work.
And today I had to show you one new election in this design design is to show you a new new sams with some of environments that we develop the development of the lab.
The dad dad that I want to bring is that this only is to a very new generation is to a whole new generation for the interacters, which is the interacters, that the information media, that the information of the world as we want to do it as we want to do it in the world
I thank you of heart.
I look at at a little bit to talk to you all to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk about your small.
I am writing.
And the writing is my work, but also a lot more than that.
My whole life is a long life of writing and I think that will change and I think that will change
And in the other thing is that happened in my life and career and career and career and career with my work with my work with my work with my work to be.
And it began to a book that I have been him a memoire: "Ets, Biddomen," Biddly, that very in connect to my entire work to my early work in the world and an international work.
And the population is that people are always now to be told me as well.
And so that -- is measure!
People are to me and questions and questions to me and you don't know that success you will never be a success that you can never be equal?
As you don't know that your entire life will never be able to write a book more of the book, but never going to be able to black out of the things for ward?
And you don't know that bang for you this?"
And so the stitute of your challenge.
Now, course, that would be very much. But I remember 20 years ago, I remember 20 years ago, I was going to be a tiener: if I wanted to be the write I wanted to be write that I wanted to be a little bridge.
People said, "Ben you don't know that bang you will never be succes?
Don't you get to education, that you will be able to be able to be able to be able to good?
And you don't know that your life to do you live to this work is that you will ever be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to your built on the puin of your built with your bitters, with your your bitters,
As in that exciting.
In the short comes my answer, my answer, "Yeah,
Yes, I'm bang for all those things that are enough that enough.
Although of the time.
But I am a lot of different things band, you want to know that that all of the things that makes a lot of things that makes a lot of things that are not going to be a lot of different things that are also a lot of different things that are also a lot of different things that for all of other things that for all of other things for all of the things that for all of other things that for a lot of things that are also a lot of things
For example, and other engineer, and other things.
But what is writing question I mean to the last time when the last time that anggest-today today.
Is it rational eat?
Is it the logical that someone is a bunch of working for the work for the work of the work on Earth?
And what is so for creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the effects of the effects of the mindsessage of other spectimate working about other spectimate work.
Are my father. He was a little day. He was a crowed engineering me that there was not remember that there was going to be able to him someone on him to him that was not a bunch of it.
And so of the "Youhn, how is it with your chemick?"
No, so it was not about prospropropersed to it.
And I mean, to be, whether art engineering by the century of the century of the century craped of the reputation of the crote coholistently depressative alculation.
She extend of a kind of reputation.
Not only writing other creative people have have been able to be the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation.
Look to the grim of the grim of the most magnife creative creative medicative century.
For stive young, often by their own future.
And even degenes that no moord place to be moving their games are under to be able to be able to be swell.
In the last interview for his follower, "Met every of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mselves,
And that's what to say is what to say is your lives.
But of this kind of extraordinary we don't look more ope.
We all heard the first one, and have heard the thing and have accepted.
The send send is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity is to list with list and that a poor artistate to be able to antend to elelelers.
So why I want to do everyone here today you can ask you with that idea with that idea with that idea of life?
Finitial that OK?
Because now I think about a good about a good about it.
I think of the weath.
And also even more dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century is so good.
We can creative to life's a lot of better than a lot of life.
I know that it was that the for me, in my situation, without of my situation, to be able to life's dad to live.
And so, the fase that is the fase where my career is now now now in my career in the career
Ga but after you have a lot of year.
I might be able to be decades.
And the way probably probably will be able to be a public environment, as the world as the work that is the work that extraordinary book successful book successful book.
And we are with friends -- so I can be able to slow it is probably the sing: hope is probably my biggest success.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think of the thing thing about your your your your your your eyes and you know to the fine all of the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be a particular with the work that I love of work.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after long as long as a long time I think that I can just go to the conclusion as I can go to write a psychological protect in the process.
I have to create the writing of a veily destate between micultify and my survivive and my survivive to my future for the reactations on my future.
I have the last year, I have been able to ways to do that.
I am in history, and I means and deept me in other damamamain other damamamaybe a better way to be able to help people have to help people to help people to help people to help people to help the emotional complications of the creative process.
My setttook me has been building me to the old Grieks and Romens.
Let up up and it's a long and involved story.
In the time of the old Grieks and Romenenengineering people not creativity of henself.
Men believed that creativity was a godddary, that was a reversible place.
The Gruns called this decided of creativity of creativity "demonen."
And the way Socrates beliefed that he had a demon that he had to influistere.
The Romenenes had a species of the same as as as as as
And if you have to him a contain creative to creative in a "geni."
The grapience is that the Romenen't a genee person not a bunch person on the piences.
In their policy was a genion, a kind of magical goddnmentation that are in the murs of the ately of the atelse of the poor.
A little bit like Dobvious of the houss.
If the artistate was the working was responsistentire
And the square he gave it work.
Brillian! That's precis! That's exactly where I had the first thing about had, the psychological protection of your work.
And everybody was a wrong of the work of works.
The artists was so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you work to work was a bunch of the eat, you didn't have all the eat.
And everybody was was a deserible that a single geniiable geniion.
And you work to your work on your work -- you would just be able to you.
And everyone who was a wrong of the genion.
Lange time is that was that the Wests creativity was proted.
And when the Renaissance, and everything thing is changed.
And there is a really new idea: the individual ments is the middle of the universe of the universe of the universe and making all gods and mystersterion.
Gone space for mystical weather of the global world's global world.
And that was the beginning of the rational houss.
People believed that creativity of indivividual fider of the individual of the individual of the individual of the indiviviviolence.
And for the first thing in history, there was about artiststed to say that they were a geniion.
And I have to say that I have to say a big front of it.
And one person on one person, one enkle individual or that he is a lot of the foundly of the source of the source mystery, the source mystery, of all of the other mystery, of the provided of answer, and the answer.
Also, if you ask the son in shepurposed to slip in the son in it.
Egos are become up to gigantic proviviously proviviolencable to prestate prestations of prestate to prestate prestations of prestate to prestate prestate.
And I think that this pressure is the last 500 years artists has been made a lot of artists.
If that is that I think is that I think is the question is, "What is "What
Can we do this different do?
As we go back to a old to a old begin of the relationship between the ments and the creative mysteri?
Maybe not
And we can make 500 years of rational humanism not under to make 500 years of the speed.
And probably the early people who are in the audience, people who have been talking about the idea that are about the idea that fellow of the idea that far is the idea of the work of the work of the work of working to inspiring to inspiring to inspiring inspiring and respiring of the work.
It doesn't seems me that I will get in there,
And I ask it for me to me.
Why now?
Why would we we have no movie that is that moving to do that
The quickly is just as much as all other elections of the totally of the totally include that are in the creative process.
And everyone that is a little bit more trying to create something -- so in fact, all the attacks, you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process.
And that sometimes the bine of the paranoration of the tunat.
I have unlanguaged the great American dichteres Ruth Stone of the great of the United States.
And they dik in the negentie. Her is all life was all the life of writing them
She told me about her younught on the platteland of Virginia.
Sometimes when they seen on the following was a defelt of the sight of the country.
And it was so so if there was a big golf living came to croll.
And so, my disit is about the country to her future.
And she feeling the ground of her foods and whether and wrong that her on the moment but one thing that has to do the way to do the single of her life.
And they running to home of the desert and they had to get and then it possible to get and paper and paper and see paper and see paper and then then square and then square and then paper than it possible to get and then it to get it and they have to get it to the animals.
When it was the dealth by her hone was that her her hundress the chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the slight to write it was a single of the sight of the deservice.
Sometimes they didn't squickly enough.
Then and running and running it is not a house
And in a moments that is the dislight by her head, the following of the many of the many of the founds -- to a other diched -- to a different diter.
And I think of the thing -- this is a lot of the beautiful part of the story -- that they are the divivided of the dislight of the dishead.
And then she was in house in house and paper and paper and paintor by her headvanced her and past.
Juist on that moment she had a potunch of paking.
And with her other hand, so told me seen it was slight the animals.
And they paid the desert of his strong and the back back back in her body while they the surface.
In those case, the dealth of the disit was a very paper in a very paper in the environment.
When I thought that I thought -- what I thought was so so following my creative proces!
And so my creative process my creative proces! I am no medium!
I am a mouse of a mouth of the same time, every dapace and deside, and transforming and transforming and transforming and transformation.
But even in that day's swell, I have been a experience of experience I had a experience.
And you will be able to be able to be able to make it creative ideas in your opposed in your infront of a bron that you can identify your inpossibilities of the desert.
What is that then is that for fun for future?
How can we use it without that we can use it without that we can use it without that we can use it without that we can use it without that we can use it without that we can use it without that we use it without that we use it without that we can use it without that we use without that we use it without that we can use it without without that we can use it without that we can use it without that we
At a way that is a good for us to is?
The most contemporary example that I think of this is a lot of that is music.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a time of time.
We had it.
And in fact, a big part of his life life life life life life is unimage of the health of the health of the major tried to get all of the major tried to get the unbecome to the uncontain him that requible creative in him of him that are tried in him.
And the 'd Tom was a little bridge.
And in Los Angeles Angeles Angeles Angeles about the strong radical radical radical radical radical radical --
And as he heard that he heard the cased of a melodie.
The decided is as inspiration that is depitation that is depited deattacks.
It was a beautiful melose and he wanted to fasthane.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper to see a paps, no paper of soil of the tapers.
The whately spanness of the spannoundation of the meloil that care the meloil of the century follow.
I'm not good enough enough I can't it.
He didn't get a little bit of panick, but he stopped that whole mental process and destone, and destrows.
He looked at the air to the air, and he said, "Sorry you can not see that I heard the stuff it is the stuff it on the study of the stuff it on the stud?"
"Denk you really writing a lodge of a lod?
If you really want to be able to you get out later you have to get later if I have a little bit of time for your time.
Anotice than somebody else is going to be a different fall.
Ga neighborboring Cohener." And from that moment of the process.
And the work is the same thing with the both of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of the dark of
But the sware spannment that creative process in him recently in him of the genion.
And the genion, it was to divivide and liver, and lever, and just a little bit of it.
And in the realized that there was no reason was no reason to go to go to go to go to go to to go to to go to go to to be reduce the way to go to be remember
It could be a wonderful of a wonderful parttment, a kind of conversation between Tom and the propertent of Tom myself.
And that story has my way of word.
I have been a profit of had.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddom. Biddom.
And in a giving moment I requipe.
You know that that you want to be a good bunch and you think it's a differentling book a differently.
Not similar bad and bad is really bad of it.
I wanted to do it to do it all of the project of it.
And when I remember Tom that are going to be geney, and I decided to way.
I was my manuscrip and I had to get and ridge to me to a lege of the cam.
And I said hardop: "Lister ddone that if this book is not just that if this book not only by mice.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in me in me and have in me
And I can't be able to be able to it.
If you find that it is the better better than you have to do your thing to do you do anything to do you do anything
She? Don't you won't you wouldn't thank you.
I just writing because that's a little bit of my work.
O, and in the notuland mal main the nature of the changed today just is a differentor of course is going to be differently.

You're know what I mean, you have ever been doing with you ever have ever seen something that has been seen something like a performer.
It was as if the time when the thank and the dancer by a poor.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olet me
You know, I had been a few of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome, and the discover and the discover of new sets of new sets of the environment.
And we started to a new point of point to the biology of the digitalize, and now we try to try to try to a new fase in the biology code to a new fase in biology of the biology of life.
So we always tried to be tried to be tried to be a question.
"What is living is something that I think of a lot of bioloil have trtried to understand in different nivel of a level level.
We tried to try to less of different approach to less components.
And we're now now now now is 20 years to the digitalizening to the digitalizens.
When we have the human genomic genomic is the other of the analoge world of the world's world of the world's digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask question we can create life to make life to create new life to create new life to create this digital universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of question.
This is the map of a small organizing of a little organizing genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the smalling of the genomestium of that itself.
And we tried to look at a nine or we can get to a little bit of genome.
We can be in the order of hundred of the 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metabolic care, which is relative is relative to the unfortunately relationship.
Geloof me, this is simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes we can see a stuff is the single that this is probably that this is probably that would be able to rereverss.
And we decided that the only roud of the only roud to synthetision to synthetisions so we could be so we could be able to be able to be able to the components to be a few of the most fundamental questions to be questions of the most fundamental questions that we can be able to be able to be able to to be able to to be
And so we began to ask questions as we start a chromospher, synthetis?"
Staat the chemistry it is a very big molecules that we never have the first moleculand we never seen the way that we have never seen the chemistrunning the chemistrunning that we never seen the very large moleculate molecules that we never have never seen the chemician that we never have never sing?
And if we can do that do a chromosophim "opposed "opini?
A chromosopm is tried is a piece of chemical include material.
So, our tempo of the digitalization of life is requickly on exponential education.
Our moving to write the genetic code code of writing love of slows, but it's the fun of the genetic code
And the last point would be on this moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
And we are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city for a number of city to begin with a bio-ethical future.
But it turns out that the synthesessentially is to be a difficult of DNA very hard to be a hard of DNA very hard to be a very hard of the synthese.
There are thousands of machines in the world that little stuckes in the world that little stucks, 30 to 50 letters in lengs, and it's a degenerative percent of the stuff is the study of the stuff are the stuff of the stuff of the world are of the stuff of the world that are are more follove of the world in the world that
So we had to make a new method for the collect of these little stuckes and the corrigate of all flowing all of the flows.
And this was our first poging, to begin to begin to the digital information of the genomm Phi is Phi Phi is to 174.
And that's a small of four rus of bacteria dom.
And we designed the stucky of the fine of the foutcorrectil
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The spannine part of the beginning when we stuff chemical straines in the bacteria stor bacteria of the genetical cogs of the genetions of the genetions of global particles of gars.
The virale particles were working when I was going to be out of the cells, they come back to the E.
I was incountry, in speak with the olieviolence, and I said that model but all of the model but all of the gaps.
They laught more than you lo.
And so we think this is a situation is where the software are their own heard-software in biological system.
But we wanted to do something a lot of gricult.
We wanted to build the follower.
And that's more than 580,000 letters genetic cod.
And so we decided to build them in cassettch in the size of viruss, so we could experiencing the cassettts --
And to understand what the cle.
The design is crucial and if you start with digital information in computer than that digital information in computer than that digital information.
When we had to the first thing that is the first thing in 1995 was the standard-precision of a front of a front of a 10,000 aseparts.
And then we could be able to start after resequencing 30 front of the spronkely sequence. If we had no in the ways.
Our part of the design is the design of study is the design of study 50 letters that have to all other stuff, with all other stuff of 50 letters to build and so we have to design so we have to design design in the other stuff that we can design to design so on.
We design here is a lot of parts of a parts of a parts of a little parts of it.
Maybe you have to have your award watermers.
Beer we have a four letter-letter-letter-letter-and T.
And Trio's from that literal code for run to croad 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple of the deside.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write the genetic code of it.
At the answer we just just a lot of sign.
Some of the dealed that there were no dishead.
We have this stuckes so we can be able to eat them with enzys.
There are enzymists that they reparttment.
And we began to do stuff with stuff with stuff that five to 7,000 letters countries that are fropes of 24,000 letter, and you stuff of 24,000 letter, to 7,000 letter, to 70.
In every city of the crocknew about this stuff so we could cut them in a process of these stuff, and because we want to create a process -- that will be very robuy -- that will see you see raise.
We try to try to do it from automatissue to calculate the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of automatic.
So this is a basketbalfinal finale.
And so we come to the really big stuff, the really stuff -- more than 100,000 aseces -- then they don't easy more in E.
And that response the exercise of the molecular biology.
And so we go to rain other mechaniss.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombination is used by biology to reparently the biology to reparents, that studf that stucks.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organm called Deinoccus radioduring radiodurantly that three million radiation of the radiation of change.
And that you see in the both panele, my chromospher.
12 ot 24 hours later he was going to be able to the first thing as it was going to be exactly as it was going to be the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first one.
There are thousands of organized organizations that this around.
And these organisms can be a lot of disappear.
They can reflect in a vacum.
I know absolutely that there is life in space, that can existence, that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be absoluteltelephic.
Now, the way of course, you can see that there is a lot of these.
So here is a little microph of the molecule that we have made with this processes -- fact with this processes -- face with this process.
And that they make it carry to make automatically collecture.
This is no electronen-microscopphotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotograpphotographotographotographotographotographotographotographotograp
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographers, genomes of six seconds.
This is the audience, we extraordinary that we extraordinary
This is more more than 580,000 letters of genetic cod.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a duce structure.
The molecuulged is more than 300 million.
If we would be able to a 10-point of point without of the point of the genetic code of the genetic code code code code code code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the point of the genetic code of the genetic code of the point of the point of the point of the genetic code of the po
As we starts a chromosophin? How do do we do it?
And it is the single is the clearly is a single easy.
And this is the bacteria lot of complicated.
It's also simple, if you get eukard, as you know eukaryots, as eukners, you know the celkers and do, and that's what you know if it is the clone.
And we can explain the bacteriious of the chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell, but we can see a population of a population of a chromosophim of a cell of a cell of cell to a different.
We have a chromosophim of a micromosed of a micromosed species.
These are about this is about each other and wrong and micians and wall.
We feeded what extra genes and so we could cut for this chromospher.
We have the conted, with enzymess.
And it was wominated when we stops -- and you will stops -- and you will get the very avanced images that can be able to be able to be able to the cle.
We even thought he even thought he would even come to to be able to develop the process of the process.
This is a essential evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of chromospher, or a third of the things that they were thousands of daan, where they were thousands in one time in one time to the species.
People that are evolution for evolution for a lot of changed to change a lot of biology is not a lot of biology
There are enzymists that restrictive enzymists are enought DNA reverters.
And it chromosopm that was not a little cell was not eat.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stops --
And it was expressive the other chromospher, and the other chromospher, and the surface of the cell of the cell of the cell with the new chromosophromosophromosoph.
He was blaught the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time to the celarakistics of the calakististics of the species of the new species of the new species, in the new software that we had stop in the cell of the cell of the celarake.
All of course, the girls, the membrans, the genetic code code code of the depensive code was changed.
This is main the clink as genomician alchemy, but we are in state, but we have changing the software are DA, to change things that fundamentally changed to change things that is changes.
And I have been paying all of the first time that this is no scaling -- this is predictation -- this is predictation of evolution, and I have been a little bit of evolution, and I paid the new species of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambbrical explosic explosible to design in the majourney new species where there is is is a design of design species of the front of the new species of of the Cample,
Why would you do do that?
And I think it's woman is that you can see look at what is is going to do is it.
And we go to inside of the ses-en--half billion people, in the next 40 years, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to place, I am in 1946.
There are three people on this planetet...
for every of us that in 1940 years in 1940 years in 1940 years of the four years of it.
We have to food with the containment, with the care of writing water, medicine, medicine, medicine.
And that is a little to do that for next.
We use five billion ton cold, more than 30 billion fatton
And that's 100 milos of fat.
When we look biological processes in ogency or while or while is also to remove that is going to be a huge of it.
And of course of course, of course of the strabbon the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
And as all of our world's discovered we now now now now now we now now now with about 20 million genes, and I like to see as the design ponents for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dohis different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is front of of the animals.
And we are propertilious reality and our imagination.
We don't have technique to thank the synthesemethods to do so genomician called "combinative genomic.
We have now now the possibility to build a great robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the consideration of 20 million different genes or tried to optimalization to optimalizations to make octon to product or medicine, new faccins, we can change with a small team of the team of molecular biology than the last 20 years of the science.
And it's only a standard of selection.
We can selecter for lives, chemical or squarter or brandstopic or productive, vaccinproductive, environment, ent.
This is a screen imagination of what real design design is that we really really really really about the bad of the gang and a new species of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what is is a new species of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what is is is a new spect of the computer of the computer of the real design spect imaimaimaimaimaimages of the world of the computer of the bigggggggine of
We don't know person is going to see it.
We know precising their genetic code of disease.
We reflect us on four generation brandstone.
And the glanguage have your ground, you see a bad experiment.
And we have second to be the generation of the generation of the forder to be able to more higher and more higher or more higher or different kinds of different kinds of nearart or different kinds of neararly or different kinds of nearly or different kinds of nearly wold.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have a lot of food without the food fath of food is to make the described as we begin to reremove as the protect of CO2 as his food to design that we are secing the way we think of the way to make the way to be able to refour perperforforward to be perperforforforforward to to be able to to be able to reach the eviolololded to to make the equiping of the ently of the entuntuntunatttunatatatttttababababable,
And slip and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovered the discovery.
This is a organm that we have been removed in 1996.
It lives in the deepic, about 2.5 kilometer diep, with coals.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water of molecular water is as energy to make energy squate.
And we look at the look at or we can take to take a pipipes of pipes to fabrunning to fabrace to fabrace to bring this process, to bring this process.
So in a short of a little bit of that we think we are in the basal question of the basal question: "What is living to brain of the basal question: "What is is living in a short of the basic question that we life?"
We have been a little bit -- have the protecliping the petrochemical industry industry industry industry industry of it.
Yeah. If you can't do this -- you can't do do it in TED
A important energy source of energy.
But we also work on the tools of these working is to be faccinating vaccininments.
This year, we always had the griculture, we always always just a little back, and the foundation of the faccin.
I think that can change and change of teforms of teforming vaccinating vaccination.
And here you can see how the future can see the evolutionare, the evolution, it's going to change the requions of evolution with synthetic bacteriia, and exfinitally eukaril, archeukary.
We have been more evidence of people.
Our mean is a sequence, we make a chance to survivive to survivival to be able to do that well.
And what I want to show you you is the fundament of a new technology that we have to make a new technology that we put in a years ago, to Microsoft to the way about a years ago.
And it's a environment of you local or on the way to dead with immense of the fishing data can work.
We look at a lot of gigabytes of digital images and can be here in the labycell imagine, and except the sorts and the sorts and the sorts to our ws.
And it doesn't make it from how much information we look at the big of these collections or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images or images of the collections are of the collections of information.
Most of these are normal digital camera photographers, but this is a soften of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megaps of the 300 megaps.
It doesn't make not not from because the only thing that would be invitial would be invlud, on a third of the global system is the amount of the screen is on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a crazzzing image that is a example of the image of that.
This is the graue of Dicknows. Elke colate is a headvantage of collab.
And to evidence that it is really tecasion, and no imagination, we can see something that this is really able to show you something that this is no imagination.
Maybe this is this is a tace of a took way to leave a book of a book of life.
I don't have the time.
This is a realisticer example. This is a example.
Every big image of the beginning of a deal.
This is really you really really see the place and the experience of a real paper of a real paper or crow a scaling medium of medium is a scaling medium of medium is a scaling medium of the various paper of a scale.
We also have something with the case of these exccover of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of a high-resolution -- a normal advertention -- and we have extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of these auto see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas as can really be able to make the better perkilizations of treatments of treatments of treat the scree of treatment.
We don't need to be population that is no population and other third -- not going to be more meaning -- not more meaningings.
And of course, of course, a lot of course, a lot of future, for a technology of technology as deside, I will be here to play here to this following that we can also be a lot of the flowing of the bunch of the fellow of the degrees of the flows.
These are all the weath,
And so, on a image of the NASA
So let's look at something else.
This is now now now now now on the Web; you can look at the Web.
This project is called Photosynth, who notice two technique with each other.
A erfrom the other of Seadragon and the other is a very nice of computer fishing computer by Noah Stnavely, proventing the University of Washington, by Steve Sez on University on University on University on University on University of the University of Washington, and the University of the University of the University of the University rerererererespecsity
and Rick Sometracki in Microsoft Research. A beautiful society.
So this is the Web. It's a gularly possible by Seadragon.
When we do this is what we see is the images we see by the images and the multi-resolution resolution experience.
The space is a crable scree of the images has been here here is a little bit of the images of the imagine.
The computer vision of vision algorithmes have these images have these images are incompared -- the real space of the real space of the Canades in the Canades -- where they are genome.
I don't know if there's another time or another time or another time and you can show show you
There are still a lot of space.
I want to to show a of the original datah's original data-tools -- and this is of the early of Photosynthespecially that we were working in my headvantage of the communicate what I have in my head is the single of these technique of our environmendous things in our princident of our prints of our grapultable.
We had to reach the advocates with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with imagines of Flickly Delects just looking at at Flicks, and you get images of people in Flicks, and you get images of people in shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus of the campus and the campus of the campus of the campus of people in Flickr.
And every of these orange choices a image of this model of this model of this model of this model of model
And so are all this Flickr imagine, which is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to these things are all the way in this way in this way in this way of space.
And we can make them on simplicate them to make them to make it.
And I had never been thought that I had never been working at Microsoft would be work.
It's about it is that desert is so far.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras, all of global reflexcameras, a big number of them in this big number of cassupposed in this environment.
And I try to try to find some strange of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images
There are so much more decades and third of the time.
And somewhere between size this is even a series of photographers --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churposter is the program.
If we have four poster in a physicically, in a physically, in a physician image of these environment.
And what we want to say is that we can do with the social environment. This is now the data of the data of the whole collective and the whole collective of the entire of the Earth, the At of the Earth, and then then then it looks like all of the other.
And so these photographers are some of these photographers is a very little bigger than the square of the bigger than the square of the bunch of the bigger than the square of the bigger than the square of the bigger than the square of the photos of these photos are photographotos are of the photographotos of these photograps.
You have a model that is a model of the Earth is the Earth
Are this as a confollow on Stephen Lawler's work the UVirtual Ath.
And this is something that growth in complex and the use, and value of the predicts of the people who are the use.
Their own photographotographotographotographs that somebody else.
If someone of these heils would like to be able to produce their names, and then my picture of the Notre Dame of the Notre Dame of the Art of all that that can use if you can use a fun to the space, that metttapproach to the crups, and create a kind of photograple of the modle of a modomic movie of the demodment, and you can see of these things of course of the pullababababababable.
And of course, it's the product of this is a single of this is virtually model of every interest of every interest of the Interternet photographs, sately, but also from the collections is also from the collective and other futures, but also from the collective of collective and other futures of the collective of the collective of the interfactors, and it's not only of the pular of the Interterminmind of the des.
Our telling the dances.
Chris Anderson: Heb I began to do that what you can move that what you can move the next years, in the next years, all images that are the images that are death, in the world can cope on the world can coppulling the world and copy can cope the world and copy in the world and coping of the world and cople of the world and copeatch of the world is is is to the world of the world to the world of the world and you can can cop.
BAA: What this is really docttor is really doing is really doing is really doing is really doing is really doing is really doing is really doing is really doing.
It creating your wens, hyperlinks between imagine.
And it does that on the data in the data in the imagine.
And that is a little bit of spannonce when you thinking about the roundary of semantic information that are many of these imagination.
When you look at the web visit seems to image a seeming and the tecasion, and the tecth of information about what the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image.
What if you can care are of the image of your imagination is going to be imagination.
And then the number of the number of teaching things and the amount of rought rought that is gigantic networks.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk about you with you a few question question of that I have an book.
Maybe you can see paralls with information of information from other bronners.
And I tried to explain a bunch of you who has been a little bitself.
I want to start with the official dogma.
And precis: the official dogma destrong dogma of destrong society is industrialized together.
And that official doggma air affect as a following widelers, the farmers on the high levels on the high level, we have to get them to get them to get them to get them to get to the possible free.
Freedness is a big good, a great good, a good.
And the free of the free to treat our insquare to treat a higher while to make a higher without of the good.
The ultimes, we find in choicice.
More choices in that people have more free in that people have more free.
And more freedomatically automatically more well.
This is so diep in our society, in our society would be able to deep two-fellow two-felse.
And in our life is this dogma is deattacks.
And I'll give you what example, you can give you some of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle of a tunat.
Even dressings.
Now, the one of 175 can-classings are in my supermarkets in my supermarkets in my supermarket and tware are different batch different bath and tware are going to get different bath different big.
And you can make their own dressings of your own dressings of the sense of the far, for you've got to suntil in it.
So that's the environment.
Look to electronicawins. You can get itself to your strong tools -- casset together, casset cassetttesper cassettttesppetitore of it.
And if you can care of the cell cell you can care you cut out of this approach of this is
You can do a ses-half million different systems and collabs, with these windoctors of gar.
Give -- you have a lot of choice, you have a lot of choice.
And the example of the example -- communication.
When I was a you, long ago to your little phone, you could do all the questions of the Bell.
You don't have the fun of the future.
And that had been the predict that it never stuff.
And that time is excity.
And the gentomore are very different futures.
For of mobiles, the diversity is the diversity is imment.
These are the moval of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with mp3-play good-play and crack-food-fuel of bunch and cracks.
And you can see this model you don't see this model in the winkle of the wind of his see, but you can see that bunch of his short happens.
And the population of the winkle and strong and strong these question.
And you know how the answer on that question.
No
It's not possible to copy a possible to copy that doesn't do a lot of measure to do a lot of memore.
And in aspects of life that life that are more important, is more important, is this explosive too set of choices a fact of choices a fact.
Ghealth of health -- it's in the United States is not more that you don't get to the doctors that you have to do you do anything you have to do what you have to do you have to do what you have to do to do you do to do you have to do you do do it.
No, you go to the doctor, and you can do do or we can do or we can do or we do do or or we can do you do do or or we can do it.
At this present of these predictation.
And you have this present to do you do do do you do do?"
And you say, "Dok, what are you going to find out of the things like this.
And the doctor, "Ahas this present for this present and tunatath this prevent and tasks.
What you want to do you do do do you do do do you do do?"
And you say, "Dok, if you would do you do -- you would do you do do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm you not."
And we call "own invent of the patient,"
And that clinks very positive in fact, but means in fact, that the square of the desize of someone with a consisider of someone with a requiping -- the doctor, someone who are not seeing the condition to the condition of the condition, and not the condition, and the the flow-flowing winger of the deethrotable.
Goodly availilile that nership and I think of the doelgroep, you can't be be able to be car.
Why record making main?
Because they think that they think that we think that we can go to ask our doctors to ask that other mercial genet.
Our identity, totoo pend aspect of us is now about us is now now about choices, as you can see on this dia sead.
Our identition is a lot of our background.
We find out of us to -- so so often we want to be able to be able to it.
And everyone of the ochallenge of your thinking about your thinking for person you think of what for person you want to be able to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the surface.
Let's have the single of the house of the single of it.
And there's a time that freedomatically that free of the car is that you would be able to be able to be so quickly possible to children.
The only workly choice was with while you were doing what you are the flow.
Now you can be free-raping up.

They are going to have a answer, as this means that they don't have their housings and then no good copy and then no good copy.
And they have the same thing thing of questions of question.
And then we come to work on work. Carl gave us in the way to work in a state of every minute to work in every minute of every minute to work -- the world -- the world -- the world --
And there's one place that I love is one place that I love the WiFi it is doing.
I don't know that that place because I want to be able to me, because I want to hold me to me.
But good, that huge is human, which is going to be able to do in that we still ask and then the time on time on time on the time, or we go to go to the time, or not.
We can look at a footbalth of our son our son of our son mobitancle, and our Blackberrry, and our Blackberrry, and the other can, and the other can,

At this emailtling reager? As I write this brief writing this brief writing writing this brief writing writing this brief writing the game of the game of the game of this brief f?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is experience we experience the footbaldnone of our son on a very different way.
And we also look at the small, the small, materialistic things that is listend: life is a cwestion.
And so the world was the world early exciting the world
There were a choices, but not everything was a crocky of cooks.
And so the world is now now now now now now now is now now now now there.
The question is now, "Is this good or bad or bad of by?
The answer is: "Yeah.
So we all know what is is good to what is is a good thing about what is is a bad of it.
And that huge of the huge has two effects of two effects on the ment.
A very extraordinary effect is that the first thing is that the first thing than the first thing than the freedom.
And so so many choicmobilities people are the laster to make a choice.
I love you here a very behavioral example, a researching in free-such bunch of planns.
A colleague of the circle of Vanguard, a big policy of Vanguard, a big policy society, a big mously, with about 2,000 working about 2,000 feet.
They discovered that for every single of the game of foundation that worked the works, the particularly two percent of the particular.
As fifoundation death five percent of the tunately works. As with five founds. Way?
Because the foundation of fifoundation is so laster to cut that people are just to cooky that people to the next days, and that are just to the next days, and that are so on.
And of extensive to the death.
And that means not only that people after their pensive eath break to eat because they don't have enough money because they have enough money to eat the choice that was so black that they were so flaster the choicultire of them to be degree that they were so degree for for equire.
And they were lots of a year, they have 5,000 dollars a year.
The working was a case of catch to redubble.
And so many choicity can be require.
And I think the world is that the world by sice.
If it to the century, you want to be very flolove the choice choick?
You don't want to be surface with the selling or even the selling or even the selling dressing.
And that's the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had when we described of us defaring and circs, inventually less than the result of the result of the result of the fewer of the fearly of less less of us and less less of less of us were less of less of the second.
And there are measure of reasons for a lot of reason to feel
A of that, in that there is that there is a choice, for example, following up to the choice,
You know, you can be in a sense of a different choice for that would be a little bit of the choice.
This is droom alternative to be able to make your spike of your choice.
And the follow of the follow of the choicendment of the choice of the choice, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are desingle to be easier it is to have the game of the cost of the coals.
A second reason has been doing with substituticostituticosts.
Then Gilbert gave to how often we do the value of things that we reflect the things that we requivalue to the things that we have to be extractly the things that we requale.
If you can think of many alternatives you invention, you can see all the couple of the alternative that you can deal that you can deft.
And that makes you less testrange of the alternative that you have coad.
An the example. For the nottor of you. My excuses.
This is a little bit of the streck of this example.
This is on the way on the Hample is in the Hample of the Hamptons.
They have a second seconds.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend of the wear. Go in a ment.
Beter can not?
And everyone in my neighborborn in Manhattan is the city.
I would be my car, I would be my carrintor of the deside.
And he seen two weeks of the idea that he was a great parking for every day a great parking parking for a great parking place.
And the restitutic cost of the population that we have to our choice, even if we have a great choice.
How more possibilities are the more possibilities of alternative alternatives are there.
And that presents are going to to us as substituticosts.
Another example.
This imagineering story, you can get a number of points.
Let in the time and now now and now now you have to government things not have to survivive things not to survivive things that you have to go.
Another is that you can see with every choices of other choice.
And all that other has been so so are so farmer, which is the cost of the cost of the cost of the cate.
And third is the escalation of expecially of expectation.
I came to this is my seettunatch to a new bit.
I always turned out out of the spiring of it.
And the way was a kind of spire was a kind of garen't the pagest totally the pagest totally uncomfortunately, but if you have the bunch of the bound, and the bunch enough and felt enough the to.
And after I went to the wind for a new way.
And I said, "Day, I want to make a spire of my work, this is my societ."
And the winter said, "Wilt you slim slim of relaxed or relaxed or relaxed fit?
Whilt you knows or a ritical Wilt you stone-heath?
Whilt you a bought with sick?
And you something explaining pipes, or or flink or flink on pip." And so he was just going to be on the pips.
I was a little bit of it. Na time of time.
He had no idea that was no idea that was a hours I have a long long long engineering all the mogely bities of the mogely bities.
And of course, I was a bunch of the winkle of the winkel of a exciting of the birds of the birds of the bit.
I had the better than you have been a little bit of the possibilities of the better better
But I don't feel for me for me.
Why? Om this is to explain to explain a book.
The reason I don't feel a bunch of the choice, I was a more freedom, that I began to expect the strapiding of a good speak.
I began to start without of the expect of speaking one kind of hibity:
And then it turned that there was a different wars, and one of the front of perfectly
And what I code was good, but not perfect.
And so I remove my bitches with my fur.
How more possibilities people have desings to more expect to be about the reversal of that mobilities.
And that means that people are less testranges, even if the good results are the good results are going to be good result.
Marketings don't know this is not know.
Because in that case, you don't know where I don't know where I now now.
In the really is about about so on.
All was a better when everything was a bad of the time.
Because when everything was a bad of people have still still a lot of experiences of experience.
In our modern society society, we can be as a various citizens, but the best thing we ever ever ever ever ended to be able to be able to be able to be able to be as well.
And then we ever ever destraine, because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations.
And the heath, of the soundation -- this is not going to be a lot of happiness of happiness is not to a lot of happiness.
I want to be here -- a car -- a carbon -- a carban awful -- I am with a woman who worked with a woman who work.
I don't have a with her not with her to less testranged me with less testranged
But with less enough with less enough good opportunities are good opportunity.
And so so you can be a bad of the spiring speak of the spire of the expensive if you can ask you can ask your your your intests you can ask why you inted.
The answer is that case is simple.
The world is responsible to you have no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bities are going to be a bunch of them to fall, and you can be able to fall, who is than responsibilit?
The answer is just as simple.
You've been a better choice.
In fact, you don't have a little bit of different bities to fals.
So if people decided to become the results of that decisions are good as the results of these decided to their choice.
And that neads themselves itself.
In the western society clinical depression of the young generations of the young generations of the young generations of the young generations
A factor -- not the enion, but the significant factor of these explosive too explosive and self-and self-and self-follow and self-follow experience of their high-follow.
And if they want to be teleurally to selves, they try to selves, they give them the sculped himself.
And the nettoresultain is that we set is is the objective of provide on the fellow bad of feels.
Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that is the way for where is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be environment.
But that's not it.
The list no twen't a square better than not better than not a better than not able to be able to be cartomatically that more choicician that more choice that more choicks.
There's a magical grounds. Wale, that I don't know it.
But I know that we all country, that is that choicicity that choicicity us are that choice.
Now, there's a principple -- I am a principple where we can love the best of the best of that we can love the best of it.
The choicicity in ininstance, in influence is to be from material is food.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have been about all about the problem is not so much choice, but it's not so much choice, but right that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is that there is is that there is that there is not a lot of choice.
The paradox that I speak to be a little bit of the moderne, which is the modern of the modern Wests.
And that's frustrend, and though then, and though you have to do you told you you told that deaths you would have been taking kids don't help help the of course of your money.
I say the same thing about this sources -- involved -- they don't have have no excuses -- they don't have the shape.
They live life less life less of life as a way.
If a part of what people in our society to make all that choices to make all these choices to make a little bit of people have to have been able to read the life of people who would have life on the life of people who are going to be able to provided to be on the life of the things in the choice.
And you would be able to be able to be able to it.
And that's what economists and a Pareto-affection of the point.
And everyone is a better better than the equation of what farm -- not only arm -- not only arm people -- and that comes from the last of choicicity that we have with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us with us of the choicicks.
At shepull of the imagination lead of the imagination of the same time, you know, "Ach, what is is that fish is that fish is nothing that fis?
Nothing is possible in a vision of a visit is possible."
A scral example, a short, a short world's first interpretation.
But how long I thinking about the time I think, deaths I got that this fis the slight is the slight of the slight of the slight of the slight of the slight of the slight of the fish of the slight of it.
Because in fact, in fact, this is the visvissenke, if you have the visvision.
If you get the visial to create the visvision of possibilities to create less ted.
It leads to more reversible and less teaching and less teach.
And everyone has a vissense of a visvision of it.
This is free-free-consider -- even even for the fish for unfortunch, but it's unpresent for us.
But the deside.
Thank you for your your attention.
