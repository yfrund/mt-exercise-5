Last year I showed these two slides to show that the pool, which is the past three million years of the past three million years of the vasted United Statand of the United States, in 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the several problem because it doesn't show you the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this particular problem.
The ice on the North Pole in a certain sense, in a sense of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and catch in the summer.
The next slide I show is a celled version of what happened the last 25 years is happened in the last 25 years is happened
The permanently in red.
As you see it out of dark blue.
That's the year ice of the year,
And the crimpt in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or parent, the almost like blood, that from the body is solid of the body hold.
And in 25 years of this is going to this go.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen freshare the North Ictual warms, and there is a very large amount of woman, and it is a very large amount of woman, when it was death, when it was death,
And the total amount of diverse in the atmosphere, that could be double that can be display that could be double if we considered the point of the surrounds.
In some undies in the few undeep in Alaska signs on all of the water.
Again, the Professor Katey Walter of Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another one.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is going to be that will be going to be that will be be going to be that will be be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be going to be that will be going to be going to be going to be going to be that will be going to be going to be that will be going to be that will be going to be be going to be right.
A reason for that, this is that this huge is that this huge of heats from the north.
This is a melt frequier.
The water-volume is echer than equipment
This is the Kangerlussua's Kanger-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sea because it is landy because it is the landy of the place where it is in the sea.
These are flow out of these flow flow out of the flow
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, the biggest ice mass on ice mass on Earth.
Actually, the month monted scientists that it whole continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole of the South Pole.
The whole continent is to sea meter seespear of sea -- like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of ice mass ice mass and a few years ago, there are new now, who were still wars.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his these.
In the Anthing, this glestyle the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more sticks.
But when they disappears it also drink it drinkwater.
In California was there a reducation of 40 percent in the snowl of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoicires.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are going to be severe.
This global dream of the drew of a dramatic fitching of bos' fuels.
And the number of course, the number of course is speaking with an incredible and never seen seen.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeeping in the pattern is completely unked.
If you look at it from a historical context of a historic context of a historic context of the happens.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 a.C.
25 miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the eye of the Stille Ocean, from America, aastone, and on every single of the Indian subcontinent, there is a behavistic dalization of the oceans.
The only major cause of warming the Earth, next to deforest deforestation, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuel fueling of fossil fuel fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of the earth,
Olie is a problem, and steenched the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extttells with China.
And there was a propose of building carbon carbon centrales to build a lot more urban carbon the centers of it.
But we see a couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the coups.
These are the coales of which the bomban was annuated in the last last years, and where green alternatives were proposed in the last year.
There is a political fighting in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industiry gave in the year 250 million dollars to promote "scon" and the cool of the contradictions.
And that picture was going to think about something that I think.
And I was the guy was in Tennessee, about four billion liter calling church church model.
You probably seen it in the news in the news of the news of the news in the news of the news in the news in the news of the news in the news
This is the one of the biggest dishem in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the cooking shape,
Video: ""Frosty the steey carbon man, a stay churban is a couple of challenge
He's fluence about this in America, and he care in America, and he caught our economy.
Frosty the urban is screen with the day of the day is screen.
He's paid and catch and deployees their job."
Here is a big part of the steenched of the coal in West Virginia from from the day.
The largest mine of the country is the country is the big bones of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship -- "Let me be clearly to me be clearly -- Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know what they have about having it talks about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, the Alliance of two campaigns on the equal protection for two campaigns on the equal protection for Klimate.
This is a piece of a little bit of it.
Video "Big COALergy, we see the climate change, as a serious threatening for our things.
That's why the reason is why the most important thing is to give us a giant to give a giant to the light and response to the light and the regular of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth is about the truth of the truth is about the truth of the truth is about the way the way the way the
Feit is, stead, not smary.
We find that the scone, and it still -- and it still read it still up.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me do that for us to go.

So let's take a look at this hypermodern shoot carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon the central
Fantastic. The machines are actually worth some lays.
But that's the sound of a cool.
Dessentially the fact that the shape of steenched causes of the main of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth,
Look at the time of this is the shows of cools today.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative security.
Video: Stember: America in crisis, the national security is the national security, the climatternal crisis.
The red red red rate in all these things, our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel like dirt colleges, and instant oil.
But now there's a killed new solution to get out of this.
For America of 100 percent scene of scaling electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get the America to get the follow of the Earth is made us and the regular and the opportunity of the Earth today.
And in fact, a solution that requires is to solve our problems.
Repower America. One on the way the regular Repower
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Imagn: It's about about the energy.
One of the speed ways to make a end of our dependence of our dependence of old fuel fuel that our planet to help our planet to help our planet to help our planet fuel that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Are investments to create good paid paid jobs.

Al Gore: There is an old African an's talking about that, "If you want to be a quickly to be everyone.
If you want to go far far to collabor."
We have to go far far and fastly quickly quick it quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I called read back to a update about how that machine.
So I am here for those who didn't ware, the LHC is the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever scientists in the case in the regular in the case in the case in the case in the case in the case in the regular arbiggest scientists in the regular of the people in the reach in the call.
It has to be the circumstances that were at less than a billions than a billions of second after the universe started started to 600 million times a second after the universe started to 600 million times per second.
Enorm ambitius, so!
This is the machine Genevy under Geneves.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors that I'm working with the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the scale.
At 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that caused to a party in the control room in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that all the way around the LHC -- and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, who were floats in the detector in the detector floor.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this the biggest of this is the biggest of the biggest of it and saw that the Internet page out of it so much out of it so much of it so much of it looked like this.
That means we made a kind of cultural as a scientists that a scientistic impact as a scientistic impact that we have made a kind of impact as a scientific impact as a scientistic impact as a scientistic impact that we have a kind of a scientific impact that we have a kind of a scientific impact of a
A week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
And they were 13 thousand of catch a battacks when the machine on full of power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too true. It's too little behavior."
They can do that because they can do superago, because they are superaturations.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can be flow that flow that flow that flow that flow that flow up that flow up the bat.
In one of the connections between the neine of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive parent.
And it was the wire was a little warmer, and it was intended to that 13 thousand of circulators.
This was the result.
This is still inpresent if you realize that that that that that magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons of the road, and they were moving about 30 inches.
We did about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out of it, what we did it.
We all have repairs.
Now, they are back on the way.
Eind muring the LHC will be againtack.
We will take it back and we expect it and we measures in junify or the right so we can go further with the building of the universe of the universe are building the building of the universe.
Now, of course, that have starting to the debate of the value of the value of scientific research. It's easy to work out the value of the scientistic research.
I think the fact that it is so hard to be so difficult that we go further than the LHC.
I shows the last words of the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to define the decade of the values of the values of the values of his learning was Michael Faraththing, this is so dangerous for the progress of human mind to the progree of human mind our images of science that we have no new world's inside of the world's in the world, and that there are no new world's inside of the world, and that are no new world's inventions.
Thank you very much.
I would like to start to ask you back to your children back to your children at your children at your children played with blocks.
When you discovered how to gray it to grab them up and awful, you were actually solving problems on the teaching with and hands of spacequal relations.
Rumilian insight is destrong with understanding the world to us
If an information of information, inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- and with my advisur Pattion and my fisher Jeek of Kalanithi -- what if we could do a computer -- what if we would be using a computer -- what if we could use a computer of the ancient -- which is if a kind of digital finger that moves on a platriblay death, which is the hands of individual characteristic interact with things.
and we can do as we want to do that?
This question holds us so considered to go to a answer, and we have a response of Siftables.
Cort case is a Siftable computer in a Coman interactive computer of a cow-cow-cow-cooky.
They can be moved with the hand the movement and they can feel their movement detect and they fattes a shairs and wireless contact and wireless contact with the shared and they can be touch a screen and they can feel their movement and they can feel their movement with the hand the fat, they can fell detect and they felt a screen and they can be inside a screen and they felt the hand they felt the fatttleequired of the holds and and and and then
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands is the physical hands can be moved by graviting it through it.
And the equal incidents are Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for digital information.
And that these helping are of the resources have a more physical different, are aware of their movement and even of the way we move them from the way we move them to discover and nice interactions.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instony to tell a video that you have a video changes and other sh it plays plays and other shed it plays plays plays played and other shape.
This interactive portraits of conscious.
Indians next to each other, they will be interested in each other.
If they are going to be surround, they can also be able to become this and what become nerrow and what nervous
And they move movement and across it and action.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction, the use of the interaction, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the interaction,
In this example are three Sifttables emmers to and I can use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and use them to go and go into a low-to-being.
If we have over, we went back to the little back.
There are some of the case of education, and the education, especially playing, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility and logic, and the result of the immediately, and the result of the immediately,
Here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci through a simple programmate.
Here we show a game that a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Siftiny literally get on every Siftle, and shake words in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is very rescue, and apply a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm going to try to make it out and I become it out and make it and make a video of it.
They were really away from that.
And one of the most interesting things of this apply is that people needed instructions of these are needs instructions of the most interesting things that people needs to have instructions of this appreciate things of this apply is that people need.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to testing it.
That's our youngest broom tester, rightening.
And it turns out that he was going to be staple the Siftles.
And for him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactive painted painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for the language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrat.
He can bring new carakters in the scene of the table, by just the Siftlowing the table.
Here he leave the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene further.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good mind "Yeah!
And by Siftles, and it can go to each other, he can response the carakters with each other, he can response to each other, and it can response -- Video: Worl -- Video: Worl it can response the carakters with each one --
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end.
and he decided how it goes up.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you Is a synthesizer and live music is that we developed with the process that we developed the sound producing that we developed the lead, bass and pressure prem.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use which you want.
These happy in the lege Siftables can be injected so that you can see the pattern itself in certain in in the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern Siftables in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern in the pat
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way of a lifetable effects of a very much effects like reverb and filter.
They are getting a sound and adapted and by the office.
And then the general effects like tempo and volume that are contained on the whole pattern on the whole pattern on the whole pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the pattern effects like tempo and volume that are being touched on the whole pattern.
Let's take a look at that.
Video: Did we start with a living in a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern by an extra lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now, I add a little bat.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter of the presses, so that I can affect live the effect of the impact.
Video: Do I can cut it by the offices by the offices of the tempo blocky of the tempo blocky.
Video: DM: Now, I copy the filter of the filter of the bas for what's more expression.
Video: I can rescue the pattern while it plays.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything I can improvise and shorter like I want.
With the dimms of the dimms of the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to the left Siftlowing the dimes.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion from my passion to make new people's destate in the way our brain in in the way our brains and the bottom and the botoms and work.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we have a few possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is just the attack is to a very new generation to the interacting with digital media, which is bring the information with digital media, which is bring the information of our world as we want.
I thank you to do that.
I look at it out to you with you all and talk to you with you
I'm writing.
Books write my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for for a long time I am write and I don't think that that will change.
And yet there is under something in my life and career and career and career and my relationship with my work on my work on my work on my work on my work on the work of my work on my work on the work of the work of my work and career is that I had to be a career and career and career is that I had to be re-inside of it happen
It started with a book that I wrote ungs a memoire: "Ed, Beminndying, Beminnen," which is very much in contradiction to my first work the world around and an international exister and an international existence.
The sequence is that people are all over and always touch everywhere, and always touched me as if I do it.
And the thing -- do is doing.
People come to me and ask care about and ask you that you can't equal this succes?
Don't you do that you will keep you going to write your whole life but never have a book that people will be going to be warm.
Don't you get there?"
And I was getting holding you know.
Of course, that would be very much like I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teener -- if I told you that I wanted to become a degree -- if I told you that I wanted to become a degree --
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you get to deal for education, that you will go to the one?
Are you not afraid you will be going to be able to do this work without that there is something from the puin of your build in your building bittery of your building bittery with your mouth as of failing?"
Something in that streting.
In the short comes to this questions on this one, "Ja"Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are called called enough.
Aldying.
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid you don't know what it does.
For example, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time when that angst comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is getting aight for work for work that they are going to their people?
What is so particularly about creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind of the mind, something that happens in other kind, something that happens.
Take my dad. He was a chememistraction, and I can't remember that there was a little bit of it was working on him that he was asked somebody to him or he was asked to him or he was not that there for it was a front of it.
And so of course, "John, how is it with your chemist?"
No, so it wasn't talking about it.
To be fair to be aware engineers by the centuries through the centuries through the centuries of the centuries for piece of manic-depressve al-coholists.
Scheating, who have some kind of reputation.
Not just writing, other creative people have become the reputation of people's pretty instable.
Look at the grimp of the 20th death leading the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many died young, often by own too.
And even the ones who don't have a suicide nurders, under their gave too cat.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of my books is a piece of mind."
That's quite a little bit about your lifest.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at it.
We all have heard it before, and I have it with my all and accepcepted it with my all and accepted it with my gover.
The hurt is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked with list and that a artistic inside and it will lead to missing the artists will lead to misery.
So why do I want everyone today to ask everyone today?
Do you do that?
Because now I think about it, I think I think about it, I think it doesn't have a little little mind.
I find the response to the read.
And also dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is so good.
We can create a lot better than we can spore a lot better to live in the time.
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be to live to that dark in the dark roof.
In fact, the fase in which my career is in which my career now.
Go too, I'm still young, amper veat.
I can do maybe four decades.
And the Hoogst of probably will be seen all I now published by the outside world as the work that followed on that outside is successful book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can explain you to well, so I can probably be my greatest success in the greatest success of me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about it, you know, you're for you knowledge the morning, you know, in the death hours in the deat.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to work with the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love with the work I love the work I love with the work that I love the work I love the work I love the work I love the work I love with the work I love with the work I love to the work I love to
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just go to write a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process in the process in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the psychological protection
I have to create the write of a securrent distance between micy and my considered and my very understanding fears for the reactons on my future authority of authority authority of the reactions.
I found it the last year to maniate it to maniate it.
I'm doing in history, and I do do do in the history and focus in other days to see or others or someone better way to help or a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search has been built me in the old Greeks and Roman and Roman and Roman and Roman
Let me up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Romen's time of the old Greeks and Roman was from hero.
Men believed that creativity was a goddle-partment of a distiny site, unknowledge to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these guys call these guys of creativity "demonen"
And Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that he was influistence.
The Roments had a kind of same idea.
And in them was a couch of the engineering creative mind a geni."
The funny is that the Roman is not a genius with a genius to a particular purpose of the person
In their policy was a genius a kind of magical goddling in the walls of the artic of the artists of the artist.
A little bit like Dobvious in the house
If the artistic was working on the genius assistance.
and he gave he gave it to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the distance of the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work --
The artistic was so in protection to be taken against for example,
If you was brilliant work was brilliant to you all the one.
Everybody knew that a invisible genius had taken genius
And you cut your work out, then you know, it doesn't just lay to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genion.
Lange time that was considered how in the Wests creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed.
And there was a very new idea: the individual human beings is the middle of the universe and the state of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attention from the godle's godlessly world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual.
And for the first time in history, there was a little bit about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I find that a big front of a big front of the
To be one person, one person, one person, one person, and the essentially is that he or she is the essential, the essential, the essential, of everything else -- that is too much -- that's too much -- that's the case of responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swell.
Egos are read to the gigantic proporations and there are institution, and there are response to prestations of prestations of expectations
And I think this drug has made the last 500 years of artists have made a lot of artists of artists
If that's so on, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a parently frip of the relationship between the relation?
Maybe not a lot of maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can make rational rational home, in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes to be in a 18 minutes speech.
And in the audience in the audience people who are requiban scientific number of them in the idea that elfaches with some fewer the work of artists with some of artists to inspiring to inspiring to inspiring into inspiring to inspiring to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the idea that eless.
It doesn't seem me that I will get you all of you in that.
And yet, I ask it down.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought don't have that thought of the mind of the things that are we going to do that thought?
It is just as much as much as much much of the totally of the totally calculate unknown unknown that is in the creative process.
Everybody who try to create something -- so in fact, so in fact, so in fact, so that the creative process here -- you know, that creative process doesn't always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to do anybody rational process to create the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process in fact, and everybody else.
And it sometimes it feels in the paranorms.
I mean that I mean the amazing American closer Ruth Stone of the American animals.
She's a thick in the nine-entire life already writing them.
She told me about her youth on the platch and Virginia.
Somes, if she was on the felt of the work was felt them, and heard a poember,
It was so so much as if there was a big wave air came air from the air of air
And so my close wave than about the country to her country to her and it
She felt that the foot began to shake her foot and it knew that her at that time, but one thing to do is, in the back: Con't do for her life.
And then she ran home, and she had to go through the close and then it had to be as quickly and paper and paper to pick out and paper to do it.
When it came up by her hold her hold her hold her hold was that her only opportunity to write it on the way it came to write it
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and ring them, but it does not move the house not.
And in such of the moments the poem by her history -- in her home, and looking at the poem -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words --
And it was a lot of them -- this is the most of the story -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were almost miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper it and paper it by her home.
Just at that time, she had a potlesson that moment.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plured it out of the air.
She paked it close to his tail, and it back into her body, while she wrote it back into her body, while she wrote it back into its body,
And in that cases came up with the poem of the paper in in the paper of paper and it was inside of the follow.
When I heard that -- I thought -- what I do is so amazing the creative process of my creative proces!
That's how my creative process! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouse, I'm a mouse, which every day on the same time on the same time and flower, and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and trans and it through it.
But even in that daily swiming in that daily had a experience.
You will also be knowledge that there is a sense that there are creative ideas in your hidden that you can identify impossible to identify that you can identify.
What is that then for bron?
How can we use it without that we get it without that we become that without the heav?
And so that good for us is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think about this is musicians.
A few years ago I interviewed it for a magazine for a magazine.
We had about this.
Tom is a lot of his life is a lot of his life was showing the shows of the contemporary of the power that is trying to get from all power to get the unconnected on the unconservable creative impulses in him him.
With the 190s, Tom some little bit more more restiger.
And one day he in Los Angeles about the fastly rowd, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard that he heard a climbing a climbing of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that does it does, unipe, catched inspiration that do it --
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashion the fashion the fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper on -- no paper ecorder to see a taneous.
The well-known exciting back and the melody of him: "I read, and then it stays and then it stays it and then it stays me century.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't get that whole mental process and he did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sat the room and said, "Sorry it look?"
"Do you really really write a song, you know,
If you really want to get this song, you have to be awful when I have to adapty.
And not a lot of the things -- you know, somebody else lots of the fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that point the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Leonard Coh
The work is still the same thing with the most known dge of the dark of the dark toon.
But the heavy exciting that the creative process in him of him that was going to distance the genius.
The genius was going to go on the skin and livers and lived only in the skin and reach it in the skin and read it in the skin and liver.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the property of Tom and the property of Tom and the property of Tom himself was going to be completely from Tom themselves.
And that story has changed my way of working changed.
I had been profit from it.
I was in the middle of Een, Beminning process of Een, Beminnen.
And in a given moment, I felt in desperat.
You know that you know, you don't want to be working and you don't want it to be a terrible disasting it is getting a terrible book ook ook a terrible book ook a disappear.
Not soil -- not a really bad bad and bad it up.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project
And then I remember that I remember that he was going to be genius to be a point and I also walk a point of the point of the point of the point of the time.
I wended up from my manuscrips and focus criped me to a fun of the room.
And I said, "Listen thoperating all of the things that if this book is not just the brilliant is, that's not just because of the things that doesn't only because of me.
You can see that I have everything in the way I have in the way I have in that.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you find that it is better to do it better you've got to do your thing to do to do you do it.
Snap you don't do that, you know, yourself -- you've got that.
I just write because that's the time my work.
Oh, and in the notators are being died to be a lot of the way that you can just appreciate on the office on the office today."
Tja--- Uentirely it comes up here.
Eeuwen ago in the North African desert African desert people to detect in months to detect in music.
Urings and hours and hours to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes it happened to be happened to be a very extraordinary thing.
One of those dancers was going to be transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you've ever seen with that, you've ever seen something in a performer.
It was as though the time and the dance and the dance of a purchased stead.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night and now it together, but now everything else together.
And he was going to reach it not just a human beings just a human beings a human beings.
In him of him in him of him him --
A goddly furing him.
If something that happened when it happened to kill Dan people what it was began to clap and in clapping it and in crops, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because that was it for them.
And by the way, a nice of historic facts, a nice fact, when Moren Spanin Spanin Spain this use, they brought this one.
The outside of the centuries and hate the centuries and hate from "Allah." Allah." Allah" in "Ollene, oil."
And that you hear today today in the day today in the flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments and flaimments today.
If an artists in Spain something impossible or magical does, "Allah, oil -- "Allah, great, oil, Sar, break of the well.
Another -- a glimp, a glimpse of God.
So, the recipe we need to have what we need to have
Lasty is the dance of the next morning to the next morning in the front of the morning to the dinary of 11 hours in the morning doesn't have goddline of it.
And at that time, he is a little bit of parents with couldn't get the catch of the case will never come to such hights.
Maybe there is a good thing that will never attacks.
What does it have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell a little bit of a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be too hurt to be not to be there.
Imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person of your person from yourself out of yourself from yourself out of yourself from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you have them to be a while to a while from a source source.
When you get ready with it, they are giving them to somebody else.
And that's how it considered everything.
I hold up the average of mind.
The last months I worked on a book that inside will be a book that will be shinking. The book where many too much too much to be excellent to be challenged out of the same thing that will be challenged to be display to be a lot of the last month
The flower of that illuster progress property.
And if my mind with me to the hall, I love me and the same on: I don't know it.
Do you have a little bit of your work.
So if you just do thing you do and what it is.
If you go to dance your job is to dance you,
If the goddor that you have been decide to decide in your work at some time in your work at some time by scene, at "Olne, "Olne."
As that not -- not though then, but it goes.
And then "Olen!"
I believe that I believe that I believe
"Olen!"How do anyway, because we have pure human love and propertly, we are staying out of the property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olne!
You know, I talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovering new sets of genes.
We actually start to go from a new point: we were the biology to the digital code and now we try to go from those digital code to a new fase in biology with the design and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions
"What's life?" is something that I think have a lot of biolos have tried to understand in different levels in different levels have tried to understand in different levels have tried to understand the other level of biolos.
We tried to get different approachieved, it back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years of the digities.
When we have sequence, it was going to get out of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask life -- we can we regenerate life -- whether we can create new, out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium with the tiny genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can considered themselves.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature called a genome genome ome of genome and we can get a nature genome --
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something, which are are.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that's relatively simple read the insistant compared to the unset.
Gelood me, this is simply simply --
But when we look at all the genes we can switch a semingle that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell the cell that this would be a living cell cell the genes we can be a living cell the genes we can do a living cell cell cell.
And we decided to be the only route prevent of this chromosome, to synthesizing this chromosomes so we could describe the components to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we have a chromosome, "Commoperat?"
Sat the chemistry it to this very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, a chromosome, ""inition, "?
A chromosome of the way, but a piece of chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of the digitizing of digitizing life is accounted on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code to write the genetic code -- but is it across the genetiles.
And our last thing that would take it on this point on an exponential curve.
We're starting to be starting with this over 15 years ago.
There were some stayed for a number of stages for a bio-ethic access of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult is very difficult to be very hard to be very difficult that the synthesis of the synthesis of DNA is very difficult that the synthesis of DNA is really difficult is that the synthesis of D
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA 30, 30 to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make the more front of it.
So we had to make a new method for the front of these little pieces and correct from all the mistakes.
And this was our first pogon, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria tiny fur.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, the foutcorrection,
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began to be a piece of chemical straight in the bacteria and the bacteria called the genetic code of the genetic code and virale particles and virtually making the genetions are making the genetic of the genetic code in the bacteria little bit of the bacteria little bit
The virtual particles were going to have been out of the cells, they came back and they came back and killed the E.
I was going to have the oil industry, and I said that model industry, and I said they care about it.
They laugh than you laught it.
And so we think this is a situation in which the software are building in a sense of the system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger
We wanted to build the full bacterial bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes so we could do the cassettes --
to understand what the stuff is the deaths of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer
When we first assumed this genome in 1995 was the standard Preached a front per 10,000 baseparate a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found after resequencing 30 folds. If we had the original sequences than it was not able to start to start.
Actually, the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to be overlapping with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to build so that they can design so that they can go together.
We design here unique parts in the fact that we have a unique parts.
Maybe you have been able to stop watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, Geat.
Trio's from those letters for re-away 20 aminozurs -- that there is a very literally attacky for every aminoxyous.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sing so.
We just remember we just asked me for ""Mo.
Some of them were teleating that there were no purpose that there were no purpose to be no purpose that there were no purpose that there were no purpose there were no purpose.
We designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repairs and put together.
And we started to make pieces of covering pieces of these are going to be able to 7,000 letters were going to be able to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, and you take a lot of the things that are sets of 72,000.
And in every stage dimess, we could have a float, so we could sequences them because we could create a process that very robuust -- that very robuust -- that will see you see the streets.
We try to achieve the point of automatishing the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And once we come to the real bits -- more than 100,000 basepares -- more than 100,000 baseparies -- they don't grow so much more in E.
That explains the most of the modern of the modern of the modern biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-recombination it, which is used by biology to repairs to repairs, that can feed by biology to repairs together.
Here is one example of that.
There is a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiation that three million radiation of radiation to radiation about radiation
And that you see in the top panel, som sopm sopm just som out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later it back into the other, exactly like it was first to the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacuum of life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be a life in space, that can promove to move a new aquatick of environment.
NASA has a lot of the way, there is many of it, there are many of it,
Here is a deeply microph of the molecule we have made with this processes -- in fact, in fact, in fact, which is fact with the right design.
Greist is that they focus to put automatically foot
This is not electron-microscope photograph. This is a couphotograph.
It's such a big molecule we can see it with a light microscope that we can see it with a light microscope
These are photographs, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences we speak out of the audience.
This is over 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a distincluding a clearing structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages just to pressure.
Now, how do we start, how do we have a chromosome? How do we have it it?
With a virus is clearly easily.
With a bacteria much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like that we just wheels out the cell out of the cell out of the cell and do another in and that's what you know if it looks like this.
And in the bacteria species of the bacteria is integrated in the cell, but we have to show that we have a full transplant transpllantation of a chromosome transplant of a cell transplant from a cell to another and it can activate a cell to another --
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbbby-size.
These are about so far from each other.
We have been going to take some extra to this chromosome.
We have it with and, and we have to make all the eggs to make all the eggs to make all the eggs to make all the eggs and make all the eggs to make all the eggs to make all the eggs to make all the eggs to make all the eggars.
It was quite sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome, and the new chromosome, and the new chromosome.
We even thought he would come to come to the soil but we tried to develop the process of the process of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of kinds of these kinds of chromospher, or a third or a third thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution is propose to evolve one of the equal of the biology has not been biology --
There are enzymes that restriction are called called called DNA that are actually called DNA is going to improve DNA
The chromosphere.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put it in it -- well,
It was expression, and the other chromosome, and the other chromosome, and so we had the cell material, and so we had just the cell with the new chromosome of chromosquite.
He was blue because he was blue the genes we had put the genes in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the one species of the species of the new species and changed he completely in the new software that we in the cell in the cell.
All the proted, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was changed.
This is a power than a genomic alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
Good, I paid that this is not a ship -- this is not a scale -- this is previous -- this is prefer in 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid that we might be almost a new version of the Cambric explosion of the Cambic explosion of new species of returns out on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what it is.
We're going to go in the next 40 years, and a half to nine billion people, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are now three people on this planet.
for each one of us who in 1946; within 46; within 40 years that there are four four are four are four four are four four are four in 1946; within 46; within 46; within 46;
We have difficult with food, with the heaving, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That's really kind of touch to do that for now.
We use five billion tons of colleges, more than 30 billion ves:
That's 100 miloons of fat.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever, or whatever, it is going to be a huge challenge challenge.
Then of course, of course, all of these carbon dioxide of the state of the state feater term.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a databsolutely about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is from there from there is forget from there.
We're proposed by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of techniques of synthesesemethods to do so called combination genomics to do so called combination genomics.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes per day.
If you think about the distribution of 20 million different genes, or tries to options to optials to produce octon or to produce octaneously new vaccins, we can change with a little team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years, we can do more molecule in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbaly, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real designs that we work on the way that we work on the gang and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on the computer can design and a new kind of on the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer can design and a new kind of case that we can actually design to the gang and a new kind of screen
We don't know how it will see out of how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code out of the genetic code out of the genetic code out of the genetic code out of the genetic code here.
We four-fourth generation of fuel today.
Our you see the foundly holanol of the anol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out from coming out of the sugar will come out of sugar to more higher fuels like octanolid of different different different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a big influence in the food price higher and the availability is to reduce the availability is when we start with CO2 as his food, and so we are celling the first of doing it in that way, and we think we do the first fourth generation that we do the first generation of the first generation generation of highly 18 months and within about 18 months and have a lot of them to have the food.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discovery, we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea, about 2.5 miles deep, in cooking head temperatural.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen and energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 CO2 and we can be able to be aware in fabried, where that is is coming back to from, where that CO2 and it is forder to send this process.
So in a short of time we think we are able to think we are able to break out of the basic question: "What's life?"
We realized you -- you know, the deavailed deavailable industry industry industry to replace.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED -- where you can't do this at TED --
A major energy source is getting a major source of energy source.
But we also work on the way to use these tools to think about quick quick fast series to think about it.
This year there was the flu, we always have a little bit of the facts of the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the teaching of textomorrow vaccines.
Here you see how the future can see the evolution is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still away from people. We are still away from people.
Our goal is certainly to survive a chance to survive for a long enough to survive that we can do that.
What I want to show you as a little bit of you is the fundament of a new technology that we can bring to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surrounded in which you can lock on the distance of visual data can work with immense of visual data can work
We look at the time here of the gigabies of digital images and can keep up here on the inside -- and except the in-- and inside and the sorters to our wishoms.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapixel of the Library of the Librance of the Library of these are reaching in the 300 megapixel of the Libring up in the 300 me
It all makes nothing because it would be influenced the prestations would be influence, the amount of pixels on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a full book, a very example of non-picture of the data.
This is the grain house by Dickens. Every colulim is a headvances.
To prove that it is really text, and no imagination, and no imagination, we can do something to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a little bit strange way to read a honor a book of a book way to read a honor a book way to read a little bit of a book of a book way to read a honor a little bit of a book of a book way to read a hand a little bit of a book of a book way to read
I wouldn't be adapt.
This is a realistic example. This is a little bit of The Guardian.
Every big image the beginning of a substance of a bottom of a did.
This is really gives you really the pleasure of a real paper and the experience of a real papers or newspapers or newspapers of medium is.
We also have done with the corner of this except of The Guardian
We made a nep advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal aadvertising -- and we have extra information -- and we have institute
If you want to see the possibilities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limits of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen fally.
We hope that this is not going to be more population and other third flawwwo.
Of course, a lot of course are a for the hand is a technology as this one of the thing like this: I'll not speak to speak to this field, until that we can also be able to behavided a lot of the things that can be able to behavided a lot of the supply of the one,
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can see it on the Web; you can see it.
This project is Photosynth, who are two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer-vision research by Noah Snavely, promoso on the University of Washington by Steve Seitz on University on University on University on University at University on University in University of Washington and the University of Washingty.
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research. A cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this -- you see that we see the images we can experience and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution resolution and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution resolution and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution and the multi-resolution resolution of the images of thing, and the multi-resolution resolution of the images of thdue resolution and the multi-resolution resolution
The space shake of the images has this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images have built together so they were going to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomomes -- where they are. And all these things are seen.
I'm not sure or there is other environments to show you and other environments.
There are many space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this summernth that we work this sumer -- to communicate what I have in my head is the reality of this tech, the reality of this tech, in the environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the lawyers and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at Ar, and you get images from the Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and campus and campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images from Flickr. You just get a reconstruction of the Notre Dame in Flickr. You just look at the pictures of the Notre Dame on in the Notre Dame on in the Notre
And each of these orange chirs gives a image of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model turns out to be part of this model again.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are in this way of space in this way.
And we can do on simple desert to simple nice.
You know, I never thought I would have ever thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft.
It's overwhelming here is so under to be including here.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras are cameras are to mirror reflexcameras a big number of thing, invented in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images and find a little bird images.
There are so much much focus and so much through faces and so on.
And somewhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here are there.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is well-chured by program.
If we have felt the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, now the data -- from the whole collective memory of the memory of the memory of it looks like this.
All these pictures are getting together and shapes a very little bigger than the shore of the parts.
You have a model that you have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth is going to be in the entire Earth.
So as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the work of the work of the ard.
And this is something that grows in complexity when it uses the use, and also grow the prepared for the people who use it.
Their own pictures are going to be able to see metape that somebody else inved.
If someone all of these heigs would like to climb their names and their names and their names from the Notre Dame is remember with all of these data, and I can use as a access to the space, which is usually using the space, which is usual versus and created of every photographs, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product of this imments are a virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only from the air photographs, satellite images and other applies and other applies and other applies, but also of the collectively separatelys.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what you do is possible to do you can possibly in the next years, all of the images that are are going through everyone in the world can copy in the world can copy in the world can copy in the world can copy copy?
BA: Yeah. What this really does is discover
It creates to your wishhoms, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the images.
And that's getting exciting when you think about the richchchealing of semantic information that much of these images are available to have the case of these images are available to the richches.
When you look for imagine, you know, you put a search, you feel a search, and the text on the webpage of information about what the image of information about what the image in the image of the image in the image of the image of information.
What if now is that coping the image of your images?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of that.

This guy, Olayuk, Olayuk, I have a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inchallenging in the 1950 were in the 1950 was to further, in the 1950 was in takes in the 1950 was put in the 1950 became inside of the Canadian government is not always moved in the 1950 were inventions.
The opa of Olayuk was going to go.
The family for his life and he was took him all his his wa, all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Intermined for the colle; they made it use it in the college of it.
The slide of their bad cases of their words of fish in case of fish.
Olayuks up for the pools of the pools or the storm that was going to the storm that was going to get the storm that was going to get the storm that was going to get the storm that was going to the pool.
He went out, he was living his bound, and he was going to catch and poep in his hand. And then then the poep began to woman, he started it as a limmaking it as a limmaking it as a limma.
He brought a low-up on the sides of the sides of the sides of the wall.
When it was solide was going to become a dog with it.
He was the dog and improvised a heart and improvise a harnails.
And then the ribbits he made a bit.
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood, and he was including the ice flake, including poeps.
And this is not going to be getting out in the other thing in the world -- in many ways, sting the Intermination of the Interminal inside and all the inside of the Interministry.
In april 1999 the Canadian government the Intermine of the Interminal considerer than California and Texas sams and Texas sams us new home. It's called Navut.

And finally, I think it's clearly clearly to those who is clearly at this home to these home of the world is really, that they don't get there.
They are somebody else home.
They are going to go to the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, the dreams of these children, just like the un-contained from the uncontained of hope.

We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convinced that stories can tell the stories that stories can be the best world that we probably the best thing we are probably the best thing we are in the world is 35 million times a month, we have in 156 million times in 156 million times a months in 156 million times a million-audience.
We make a felt to travel to the equipment to the equire, to our audience, to such a very specifically instituated by what he sees it seems so that hopefully afficult the most important baring of the anthropology will go around, that this world in seems to be in a way to live in a way to live in a multicultual world and pluralistic world and pluralistic world
and all the way of all the population can be saying to our considered well.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question about some questions, and I have a book in a book in a book of the book
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
I try to explain some of the bulb that you might have a little bit of you might have a little bit of you might have a little bit of the connection of you might have a little bit of it.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all of the Westery, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is afficial dogma is the well-of our citizens on the highest level, we need to give them so much as possible to give them so much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human beings of the human existence.
And the equal freedom is freedom to action to go to own insches to be a higher well-to-of-to-of-inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in chains.
More choices love in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well.
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be in our society that would be in the way.
And in our lives is this dogma, this dogma,
I'll give you some examples of our modern choices.
This is my supermarket. A tool. A tool.
Even about threats.
And at the time, at that 175 changes are enreading threats are in my supermarkets of different extra-vironments are virtual goly and twal--a-engineer.
And you can make your task of your task for the case between 175 species for you, for the 175 species for young nothing in the side of young in it.
So that's the atted, I was going to be holding my supermarket.
Look at electronics wins. You can get your strongly -- amazing -- aware cashed speakers, cassetttesped tespaler, radio, surprising --
And if you get that one electronics out of this nuclear at.
You can have six-and-half million different systems, with parts of parts from that wine.
Get me have -- then you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could all kinds of the phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You hurt it up. You don't bought it.
That had the way the fact that it never go.
And that time is for.
And in the way there are lots of different across it.
And in cellphones is the diversity immens.
These are the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with m3-player and crisher and crishing crishing and crishing fuel-breake.
And if you don't see this model you don't see this model in the wince: but you can sure that happens.
The sequence, people come to the wincle and imagine this question.
And you know how the answer to that question,
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobit:
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attacked the distribute of stuff, this explosive is a fact of choices a fact.
Gealth care, it is in the United States inmiddle of the doctors that you go to the doctor, and that you have to do what you have to doctor,
No, you go to the doctor, and say, "We can do A, or we can do the Bet, or we can do B B
A has this one has this one and nady.
BBy has this moving. What do you want to do you to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what does you?"
And the doctor, "A has this front and tasks, and tasks, and tasks.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own introduced of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide of someone who are shift from someone who are decline -- the doctors -- the doctors -- the doctors and not the best condition to take decision -- the patient. For on recipatient to take decisions of them are being made much more reciviling -- the patible measures of them in the line of the degreeply of the brain of degreat,
Good deavailable to go up, because the goals, because the goals, you can't buy it.
Why do do it -- if we can't buy them to buy them?
Because they think we are going to be the next morning our doctors to ask that other brand to ask that other notice.
Our identity, yet a ingresponse of us existing aspect of us are choices, like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is of our background.
We find ourselves, we do it -- so we just want to do it -- so we do it --
Everybody morning, you have to think about what person you want to be thinking about what person you want to be going to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family is the family.
There is a time that freedom everybody else there was automatically that you possibly possible and so quickly as possible and so quickly as quickly as possible to children began to start as quickly as quickly as quickly everybody was possible.
The only choice was with while was with while and what you did did to do it.
Now, free everything is going to get all for the time.
I give you a little intelligent students, which I have to get less housing lessolence.
They are not dommer or air than in early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Sell I married or not? Sal?
Or will I wait? I wait? I first children, or a career or a care?"
These are all suspendent questions.
They go through them to have a answer to have a answer to have the other words, and it doesn't have any good catch and not a good number half.
And they have the same life. They're important life questions.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just all of that technology us to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every day in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place, by the way, I love secret that I love the WiFi does.
I don't know because I want to keep that place for myself.
But good, who are huge choices of work in that we are going to be able to ask us to go and ask us to work or not.
We can look at a footbalweth of our song, with our sone, with our cellphone, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry.
And even if they all get out of the task of that task with all sorts of those death, "Am I asked this phone, "Am I responsibility?
So what I write to this emailing emailing this letter?
And even if the answer is the answer of our son the football of our son a very different way.
And we also look at the big, the small, the small, the college, life styl: life is a kill.
And this is how the world used to be used to go.
There were a little choices but not everything was a killing choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad or bad bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad bad or bad bad or bad bal?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what there is good about is a good thing about it, so I'm going to talk about it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two negative effects, two negative effects on the human beings.
A very free effect is that it works more than contained than free is that it works than free
With as much choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of that, a research to investments in volunteer planning.
A colleague of me got access to investment data, a lot of Vanguard, a major policy with about a million employees with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fighting.
They discovered that for every decades of every decade that the worked on the work, the paramental two.
As fiftip founds. Why?
Because it is that it in fifg is so disappears so difficult that people just explaining the choice to the next day, and that I put it out and that -- and so forth.
And of the expose comes down.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionate, not only they have a dry bread because they don't have enough money because they have not been enough money so much as it was so much so much as it was so much so much as it was a lot of them to have a lot of parts for it.
And they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The worked about it was willing to double their own contribute to doubles.
So many choices can be a lower. So the considered
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it comes to the century the century of you to make the right choices, right?
You don't want to be reflected with the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing that we were also if we dish the lost of our dish and cooking less rate, finally less rately with the result than the case, if we had had had been when we had had had been as cally.
There are further reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it can look like the choice.
You ask you in such a case that a other choice would be better than a different choice for a different choice for that a other choice for that a other choice for that a different choice for that a other choice that would be a different choice for that a other choice for that a other choice that would be a case for a case of the case that a other choice better of
This is dreamed alternative is going to get you to get from your choice.
And it is doing the front of the choice of the choice that you have made that even if it was a good choice.
How more options are going to be able to easier it is to have the spike of unaway from the geost of options.
A second reason has to do with substitutions.
Dan Gilbert gave in all of how often we make the value of things that we dependent on the things we require to the things that we reach them up.
If you can intend to intention, you see many alternatives you all the quickly alternatives that you avoid you describe that you were determine to the did.
That makes you that makes you have chosen with the alternative that you have chosen
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is the champtons.
They have a third thing,
They are in a beautiful strand. Straling weather. No human in face.
Beter can not me? "Don't be thinking man, "Don't the care.
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is the city of the city
I could my car for the door, I could do my car for the door."
And he is about two weeks with the idea that he was a great parking every day again, and a great parking place.
The front cost of the followed of the full of our choice, even if we make a great choice choice.
How more opportunities are possible to be more attracky alternatives are there.
And those presenting us as a substitutional cost of our as substitutions.
Another example.

Life in here, and now for example, and you don't have to go.
Another point is that you have to decide other choice other choices.
And all of the other has so attract as it is that the chose of option is getting up the government.
And third the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this in the time I came to a new breezing for a new breet.
I turned out to almost of them are always spirit
Bet, there was only one kind of stuff and it bought you couldn't do it -- it was unbelievably unbelievably unbelievable, but if you were the bound, and often enough you feel enough and often enough wait,
And then I went to the wink for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff -- this is my me."
And the wind said, "Would you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you or a rit? Why you were a riting? Why you were stone-a-washe?
Do you have a bound?
Wilt you something like that, you know, or flink or flink out of the pipone." And so he went through it.
I was spot from that. And after a while I said, "I want to say, "I want the only that used to be the only who used to be the only book that early was going to be the only one."
He didn't have any idea which was a sense that was and so I have a hour all the possible bits are going to be adapty.
And it was quite fairly -- I remember the winket invented with a challenge of the breet.
I had done better than I could do it better for all of those possibilities I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To this to myself out of myself, I wrote a book in a book in a book of the book
The reason I didn't feel better with all of those choice, was that I started expect to expect the speed of a good speed.
I started without any any expectancy because I was a kind of stuff --
And then it turned out that there are different wars, and one of them would be perfect.
What I bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I reach my bound, I reach my found, and that asked me television, and that asked me telegging.
How more possibilities people have to expect people have to care about the deserve of those possibilities of those possibilities.
And that means people are less touched with results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about that.
And in the real thing is going to be about so on.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse when everything was worse about it was a surprising experience.
In our modern society we can be as well-to-perfection, but the best thing we can do that anything that we can do it is that something that we can do as good as we were invented as well.
And we are getting surprising because our expectations, my expectations, are torend, torentirely to be high.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you all of you have come -- the secret of happiness is not too much much expect too much much much expect too much expect too much of happiness.
And I want to ask here -- a car biographically elementally -- that I am with a woman who is really fantastic.
I didn't have me with her less too.
But with less enough needs his good opportunities.
And finally, when you have a bad sat at the time, when you get a bad at the time, but one kind of presidered -- but one kind of presidered why you can you deal with the questions of why you are untelling you you to ask a bad at the time.
The answer is in that case.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds available and you buy a that turns out to fall, who is than responsible?
The answer to me is just so simple.
You had a better choice, you know, you can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different ones you don't have excuse to fail.
So if people decided to take people decided to decide of those decisions are good, they are television, they have television, they are television,
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of time.
A factor -- not the end, but a significant factor in this explosive shows that people have so often in this explosion, is that people have so often have to be so often television,
And if they try to explain to explain to explain to explain themselves, they have the deaths themselves.
So the nettoresulate is that we talked about it, but our bad objectively -- but our bad feeling.
Another a collaborate together a collaborate
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be adapted by everybody getting for where it is going to be adapty.
But that's not the way it isn't it.
It doesn't have a doubt that can choices better than not covering automatically that it is more choice that more choice is more choice is more choice is more choice is more choice that more choice is more choice.
There is a magic fluence on choices on choices. Well I don't know.
But I know we are all the way that we are all over the point that choices us are professionals.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best thing to do about the best thing to do about it.
The choices in industrialized countries comes out of material is coming out of material overfluence.
There are many places on the world, we heard about that we have heard about where the problem isn't so much there is too much there is too much there is too little choice is too much of choice is that there is too much of choice is that there is too much more choice is that there is too much of the world,
So the paradox that I speak here with this is that I learned to the moderne, which is the moderne, which is going to be the moderne,
That's frustrers, and I do this is the frustrery you told you that throw and told you that expensive and installing your child sat at your money. Suns of your money.
I say you the same thing about this dure, included choices -- they don't help -- they don't help it -- they don't help to shade it.
They make us live less value.
If a part of what people in our society is in our society to make all these choices to make all of these choices are in the way that people have to go forward all of the people are going to go forward.
And our lives in the life's living to go out and go out and go out and go out and go forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improve economists.
Everybody is better by reversion of well-of-freedom -- not just poor people -- and that's coming from the choices we are with our our lives.
And so so if you read this image of the image of you as a developed of the people say, "Ach, what knows that fishing fishing from the fish of the fish.
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scale imagination, a short global imagination, a short global imagine,
But the longer I took the one, I understand that this fishing this fish.
Because in fact, this is that there is this on the fish crazy to create the fish of possibilities, you don't have a freedom, but under you have no freedom.
If you get the fish calls to create opportunities to create opportunity.
It leads to more lost and less ratch and less ractions.
Everybody has a fishing to a fish.
This is free certainly destroy -- possible for the fish.
But the definition of a figures of a figures to ask is to ask and departy, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
