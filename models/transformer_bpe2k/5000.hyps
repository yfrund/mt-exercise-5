But this is actually the errate of this specific problebecause the same thing that it didn't see the icks.
The ick of the North pool is in the clope in the clops of our global coal system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the six in the six in the six of the zome.
The next dia I shows that I see is a version of what the last 25 years.
The permanentire amazing in it.
And as you see it out of the dout, it from dark blaw.
That's the year, the year, the journey of the winter.
And the crimpt in the crimpt in the six of the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt of the crimpt in the crimpt of the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt of the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimpt in the crimp

This patterner is a lot of incredibly unch of it.
And if you look at a historic context than you can see what happened.
And in the last five five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 fun every 24 hours --
25 mities and ton every day in our oceans in our ocean good at the U., and K, and the ce-axy-fare, and the six of the India, and every single of the Indian axality of the ocean axy-sturbs in ocean ath,

Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klives for Klimatter campaigns on touch of the tell.
This is a pieces of a pieces of a pieces of a pieces of a pieces of it.
And I think "Bue COLwory, we see the climate changing changing changed to our own challenge.
That's why the reason why the reason why the goal is to give a gigantic behaviors to the light the living to the light the living of the truth of values of value.
Fime is not cool is not smark.
We find that it is the scree, and it is the run of the rules of it.
So, you know, you make a climate change.
Let that but it was going to us.
Video: Acteur: Schone of cool, you have a lot about it.
So let's look at this hypermodern scue scipy scree centrale.
Fanttilic! The machines are going to be what laught is the way to the machines.
But that's the sound of scene, the happiness.
And the fact that the fact that the fact of stead, one of the most important important to the Earth, the Earth, changing the Earth, changing the Earth, the surface of the Earth's going to see here here you see here here that you see here here that you see here.
And look at the scree, this is the scree of cools of day.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational of national refable.

The rowd on all these things that is our independence of phol fuels, like free couple of the ple and search.
But now there's a done one of them to solve up to this.
For America of 100 percent scene, the etricity to 10 years.
A plan to get America to get to get to get a plan to get us us to get us to the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And it was a solution that was a solution to prove our problems is to solve our problems on our problems on the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of it.
Repower America. And the Everyded.

We need to go to go and far far and quickly.
Thank you.
And I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I was going back to come back with a update about how that that machine works.
So here I was a lot of the LHC that there are not the LHC is the largest scientific experiment, 27 kilometers in the omb.
It should be the environments that was going to be able to 600 million second of the universe of the universe the universe to 600 million dollars per second to 600 million dollars per second to 600 million dollars.
Enorm ambition,
This is the machine,
We took pictures of that less less less Bangs in detectors in detectors that I work. It's the ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSetor -- 44 meter in the diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the scale, so you can see the scale.
And at 10 september of the first year, we put the first first first of the first first of the first first of the first time to the first first of the first first of the first first of the first first of the first first first of the first first first of the first time we were the first time to the first of the first of the first time to the first first of the first first first of the first first first of the first year.
This picture was genomomed by AS.
And that are the care of a fearing of controll.
It's a picture of the first particular particularly that helped up the LHC ging, and with a pieces of the LHC, and the clude in the detector in the detector in the detector of the detector strice.
And the other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September of the first time we were working that the machine.
I don't know if this is the largest future, or if somebody to Google and saw that the Internetic and saw that the Internet.
And that means we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact with a scientific impact of the pacaction of that means we have a cultural impact of the pacaction of the cultural impact of the cultural as a cultural as a cultural as we have a cultural system.
And a week later, we had a problem with this golarming machine, what had to this gold.
And that behaviors ago, 13 thousand of the machine on the machine on the machine.
The engineing of you will say, "Well, you know, "Well, it will be little behavior."
They can do that because they do it because they can be superaturs.
So on me on the min 27, the space between the sterries that can bebehaviors that behaviors that behaviors are behaviors that behaviors that behaviors can behaviors that behaviors can be the space, and the behaviors.
And in a of the connection between the news thousand magnets in the LHC, a constructive of the LHC,
And the main the wirell of the wirelectrical wear, and there was a thousands of the 13 thousands of that 13 thousands of the 13 thousands of the 13 thousands of the 13 thousands of the wirelectrical wear.
And this was the result.
This is still inpressive if you realizing you realizing that that magnets more than 20 ton the same time to the 30 centerns of the center of the center of the center of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the centerness of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of the ws.
We had to have about 50 monkets.
We had to try them out of stories, what we did we ded.
We all all of them all of them all of them all of them all of them all of them in the time.
And now they go back to wea.
Eind moundate the LHC will be intace.
We will be able to go to the universe and we can go to the universe or now, so we can go to the expect of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
And of course, of course, that unhappiness to the debate of scientific research. It's easily easy to work.
I think the fact that it is that the fact that we go to go to the fact that we go to the fact of things like the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientists to the last words of the true of the true of the values of the value of his living -- are are living to be the most of his living to the most of his living to the imagine that we have a lot of the magine of the most of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine, and that we are not the exciting of our myself, that we are not a lot of our of the mamajor of the last last last last last last words, and the the the the the the the the des.
Thank you.
I would would start to ask you start to ask you back to your child when you know, when you played with blocks of playing.
And when you discovered how you had to move them and they were going to get up and then you actually actually actually actually problems by the welling the welling of space relations.
Rimply insix is a lot of the world to understand the world to understand the world to understand our universe.
If a inform inspired by the name of physical interaction of physical interaction with my advision -- and my advise to my measure -- and my measures -- what we would ask me -- what we would ask to ask a computer of that we would be used to ask a computer that we would have a weeks that a weeks that we could be a weeky with a a lot of a girl-ffree-fish.
and we can have ordenies like we want to lear?
And this question question that we decided to be a answer to look at the face of Siftable.
Cort together is a Siftable, a Siftable.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to each other movement -- their momovement and they can go to the screen and they can be able to the cirls.
And the clearn, the physical hands are just like blocks like blocks like blocks by the poor.
Boventural Siftables a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for the ways of digital informan.
And that this hulple of these homes have a more physical difference, and even of their movements of their movements of the way we move them to be different new and learning to discovered them to discovered.
I will start with some of some of a simple examples.
This Sifttable, and including a video to tell a video and other playing, and others playing, and othersquart playing,
These interaction, these interactions, are the interactions.
And Indians are other other places will be able to each other.
And if they were ringly, they can be able to be what it also can be able to be what it also become out what it to be a crazy and they can be able to be able to be able to be what it also can be able to be a crock and what they can be a lot of it.
And they feel them movement and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of these interaction, the use of these interaction, the cross of a small of a small of a small of a small of a small.
In this example of three Siftables of the past of them and I can use them smalls to be small to be able to be able to be able to be able to be good.
If we have the dreaming of the dishape.
And there are some crather move education for the education, and playing, and then they have to the result of the education and how we do people to have to protemporate things that we want to see the result of the result of the results of the result.
Here I took -- this is the development of a Fibonacces a simple remember.
Here we show a spel that a cruising between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you want to every single of the Siftable, and and case the case in every Siftable, and the case in a words,
No about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and difference, and difference, and difference.
Thank you.
These are some of the Media Lab, and I am a Lab, and I am am in the crather than to make a video of them and make a video of it.
They were working on it.
And one of the most interesting things of these futures of these futures are not not instructions of these future.
And all of what you have to say "Moo's word" and they know exact what they know exactly what they know exactly what they know exactly what they know exactly what they know exactly what they know exactly what they know it.
Here are some other people on the tests.
That's our young both batta tester, recenty.
And it looks like he looks like the Siftables well,
And for him this was just blocks.
Here is a interactional scree,
We wanted to the late of the teaching of tool.
This is Felix that demonstring.
He can make new carakters in the scene, by the Sifttable, by the table.
Here he shows the son it.
Video: The zon it.
David Merrill: now he has a tractor in the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God had daan! Yeah! Yeah!
And the scue of Siftables and the nature of Siftables and the carakters to each others -- Video: Wiff --
DM: and so are are own story story
Video: Hol!
DM: It's a story with a story with a next end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end up a story of the end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end up a story of the end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end on the end end end end end end end end end
and he decided to the government and he decided
Video: The cat the airs of the cate.
DM: The last example that I will be a synthesizer and living musics and lives a synthesesizer product to develop a happen of the lead, as the lead, as the lead, as the lead, as the bass of the basic including of the basice.
Eengineering has been able to you can see that you can use you to use your wants to use your want.
These happy can in the lege Siftables are interested to be interested to be the patterns that you can see the patterns of the patterns of the patterner in the pattern.
You see a sound in the pattern in the pattern of a living Sifttable, there are living to be a controllll.
They are being a sound to a sound and attend to cancy.
And the algemental effects like tempo and rememe that are the whole patterns are the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We beginning with a leaad places in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern.
And I festead of the basline of the basline of the basline
Vide: I feel what I feel what I feel work.
Video: And now I can cople the filter of the filter of the filter of the purpoint of the purpoint of the purs.
Video: I can I can be the surface of the changed to the cancer of the tempo blocks.
Video: Now, I look at the filter of the filter of the movie more expression.
Video: I can resciped the pattern of the pattern.
I don't need to find anything that we don't know everything that I can make improvision, and it very longer and make a very longer and make a very longer and make it.
And the end end end of the dimmmmbers of the volume Sifttable.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion of my passion from the new people, my passion of new people's interfaces that our brain in that our brain in in the brain and work.
And I had to show you the time to show you one needs to show you one needs to show you a few of some of the developing of the developing of the development of the develop in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about this is that this only only the only only only enough to a very new generation of the interacters, that the interacters, that the information to our world to our world to our world to our world to our world to our world that we want to our world to our world that we want to our world to our world that we want to our world that this is the information
I dangerous of heart.
I look at the next to talk to you to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk about you all of you all of you all of you all of you all of you.
I am write it.
And But, my work, my work, but also a lot more than that.
My whole living living to the whole living of written and I don't think that that that will change.
And there's unlanguage in my life and involved in my life and career, and career in my work with my work with my work with my work on my work to have to see my work on my work to see the work on my work to see the work of my work with my work on my life and career in my life and career in my life and career and career.
And it started a book, I was that I have a memoire: "Eath, Bidd," Bidd," Bidd," that is that very in the first work of my first work on my first work on the Internations.
And the follow is that people have to be away to me me like I member.
And what -- --
People come to me and ask me and you don't know that you don't know that that you can't be be that you will never be a success to eat me that you can never have this success to be e?
And you don't know that you will be able to be able to be able to write a book, but never will never be a book, people will will be able to be able to go up to the reme?
And you don't know there are not working about it.
And the hundred of course, you know, you know,
And of course, that I would be very very exciting me that I was the critic, I was a tient, when I was told that I was told that I was going to be able to be able to be write that I wanted to be a little bit of the write -- I wanted to be a little bit of it.
People said, "Ben you don't know that you don't get success you will never get success to be success to be success?
And you don't know know that you don't know that you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the enternat?
And you don't know that you don't know you know you know, you have been able to this is that there are someone of you will be able to the public of your buildings with your buildings with your built with your months of your buildings of the public bit?"
Is in that that it is that it sets in that that it is the challall.
And in the order comes my answer to this questions on this is "Yea."
Yeah, I am worked for all those things that are enough things that are enough of things that are enough enough that are enough of things that are enough things that are enough enough
All of time.
But I also think of a lot of different things are not know where you don't know where where everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for everything for all of the other things that are also not know what we don't know that that you don't know what the time.
For seeing example, and other engineering things.
But what I mean, I would ask myself to the last time that the last time that angle today.
Is the rational el?
Is it it becomes somebody is that somebody is working for the work for the Earth?
What is so fortunch with creative process, we make our effects of the written of the gest of the galaxy, something that we don't have happened to other.
No you know, my dad my day. He was screengineer, and I can't remember that there was that there was in the 40 years that he was ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to him or he was not to it.
And I said, "Yohn, how is the with your chemistry to your chemist?"
No, so there was not about it.
Om fairly people have been to be able to be able to the century with the century of the reputation of the reputation of stuff, depressive alcoholists are depressive alcoholists.
She says that have a kind of reputation.
Not only write of creative people have to be the reputation of people have have to be instable.
And look at the grimp of the grimp of the most magnife of the 20th century.
And many of them are follows, villays.
And even degenes that don't have to be able to be able to be their gave move to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the gave of the gave of the gave of the gave of it.
In the last interview for his food said Norman Mailer: "Met every of my books is a piece of my books of m."
That's what to say to say about you think about you living life work.
But of this kind of kind of this kind of of this kind of excouldn't look at it.
We all heard the first ones and have the first thing to the first thing about it.
The send send send is that creativity is that creativity is that creativity to be a artists will be able to be able to be able to be able to elelelelse.
So I want to say to ask anyone here here here to you that idea of living ving ving life life of living ving ving ving ving it.
And I think you think OK?
Because I think about it it was a good about it.
I think it was the weard.
And also even even though of them seems of them like that.
I didn't see that this this century is that this century as well.
We can creative a lot of become a lot of it.
I know that the thing that it was the mirir, in my situation, without of the dark to that dark to that dark to live.
And the seck of the fase in my careers now now now now now now now now now now now now.
Go one, I was young up a vement.
I can have been four decently, I can work.
And the most probably probably will even even even though I will be in the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of that outside the outside of that outside the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the
We are with friends of friends -- so I can be able to be able to the same success of my largest success of the largest success of the grandands of the grandands of the grandands of the grands of the well.
Yemig, what a ideas.
If you think if you think you know you know the owns of the owns to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be a squired where I love the work of work.
The question question "Hu?"
And I think of the conclusion to the conclusion that I can just just just just by the scree of the psychological initic involved in the process involved in the process involved in the process invent.
I have to create a free folt a vice focus between micultil and my governments for the reactons of the reactons of my future.
I have the last year, and I have to do it in ways to do that we have to do that.
I mean, I mean, and I means and do me me to see in other people, and maybe a better way to see or others have to creative people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My setttook me me to the old Grieved Grievement.
Let me because it's a long and invitial story.
In the old Grieks and Romenen's old Grieved people who didn't creativity was creativity of henterness.
Mand believed that creativity was a godal of a godal of a remajor of a representation of the human responding and unknown and unknow.
The Grieved this became up this behull of creativity "Don."
And I think Socrates a demoon that he had a demoon that he had to the way that they word to influence.
The Romes had a spectouch of the Rome.
And we have to create them to creative creative creative to creative a geni."
The grapper is that the Romenen's not a genet, without of the Romes are not a piences.
In their bebecome a genevily a kind of magical godnments that was the ately, the ately, of the ately of the ately,
A little bit like Dobvide the house of Dobvior.
And when the artists was working on the genet.
And the fact of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly what I think the first thing I think about had, the first psychological protect the results of your work.
Everybody knows how that in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work in his work
The artists was so in the artiming of nartiming cism.
If you were working on the foot of the eat, you know, there are not all the eat.
And In’s a wrong that a unface you had a squate.
And when you work on your work on your work on you, you know, not only at you'd just like you,
And Inight, you know, you have a nogal genion.
Lange time is that that is that the Wests in the Wests was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changes.
And there are the folt of the individual human be: the middle of the universe of the universe and mysteries and mysteries.
Go for mystic weath, and eat the godnments of the godnment.
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual came out of the individual.
And for the first thing in history was about artists in the first thing that they were a genious genet.
I have to say that I have to say that a big follow.
And one personon, one personon, one environment, and the farmer, the vement of the essentially mysterion, the broath, the bron myster, which is that godnments and the knowledge of the global gone for a lot of a girllly.
Also, you ask the son in sunch of them in the sone.
Egos are are built to gigantic proviously properssquare are imprestats and there are pultions of prestates.
And I think this pression the last 500 years, the last 500 years.
If that is, and I think that is the question question: "What nu?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old time to a old beginning of the relationship between the human mysteriou?
Maybe not not
We can make 500 years, we can make 500 years, we can make 500 years.
And the earth of the audience that are people that that were the audiences have the idea that we have been about the idea that felt of the idea of the feet, the idea of the parts of working to inspiring up to inspiring tes of them to inspirerces and bring them to inspirerate the idea of the idea of the idea of the audiencevent of the idea of the idea of the idea that that we have to insponding the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the people that
It doesn't seems me that I don't want to get you to get out of that.
And I ask me me me.
Why nois?
Why would we have that dad not move that we would have to do that day?
The quickly as much as much as all the other elections of the totally of the totally of the totally that are in the creative process.
And everything that has been create to create create -- so so that it was all all the attace -- it doesn't always creative percent of the creative process of them --
And that they get some of the parance.
I have under the great American diched American diched Stone was moved.
And they are died in the neart of the neart lives.
And she told me about her yourself to the plattely of Virginia.
Somes, when they were the felt working, and the shaped them a diseen them a divernature of the country.
It was so so if there was a big golf living to the clucks.
And this is the sight of the country, the country to her fun to her fu.
And they feeling her foot her food, and they started to scue her on that her time to do it in that time to her life.
And they ried to house house, they had to house the disight and they had to get it to pay and paper and paper and paper and paper and they had to pay and they had to crow.
And when it was the sight by her hit was her hit was that her entire to scree.
Sometimes they were not quickly enough.
And then the next and ring and running it to the house house is not it.
And in the time it was the sight of her healthy to her head a about the many of the many of the many -- in a other ditttable.
And I was a lot of the most of -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the galmost of the story -- that they were the gare.
And she was them in house in house and paper and payer, and scope it was the disight by her her it.
You're going to get a potelling to paking.
And with her other hand, so the other hand, and she's seen it out of the air.
And they paid the sight of his stome, and the back back back in her body while they were back to her body up in her body crather it was crow.
And in that I came out of the sight of that in the sense of paper in the paper in the case of paper in the wrong order.
And when I thought I thought -- what I thought -- what it was a future process my creative process.
And it works my creative process no! I don't have medium!
I am a mouse of a mouth of the same time.
But even in that day's living to have a lot of experience of experience of experience of experience of experience of experience of experience of experience of it.
And you will also be able to know that there are creative that there are creative ideas in your operation of a bron that you can be possible.
What is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that than than it.
How can we use it without that we use it work?
And in a way that we have a way to us us a way of us for us a way for us a way for us for us a way for us a way that we do it.
The best contempora example that I can think I think that I can think of this is music.
A few years ago, I was a few years ago, I was a time.
We had it.
And to get a big part of his life is a big part of his life life is the crather of the major of the major of all the major to the including on the unfortable creative of the uncluding impults in him that it was severes.
And the way the 'd like the year of the years of the years.
And in Los a day in Los Angeles about the stradical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical --
And as he heard there was a squarter fragmentous of a melodie.
And it decided to the heavily that is that the way that is depultip, couldn't be a cellend.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fasthout.
But it didn't know it.
He had no paper tout, no paper of the taper of search.
The whatever the spanness of the healthy of the universe of the universe of the heaths of the century of the century of the century of the century of the century.
I don't don't good enough enough I can't it.
He didn't couldn't be in panice, but he didn't stop the whole mentale to the whole process and death, and they did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry and said, "Sorry you can't see that I would have to see that I would like to the piece of it.
"Den't really that I can really go up a love of them to write a love of it.
If you want to get this love is that this love is you have to go to do something, you know, when I would have to you have to you have to you have to you have to do it.
And not, not, somebody else else.
Gooa bubutttook Cohen." And it was going to be a lot of them very others.
And the work is the same thing with the most of the tremendark of the trement.
But the square spanness that creative process in him him to him a when he distance of the genion.
And the gent him on the house and living to the house and living up the house.
And in the realized that there was no reason was no reason to go to go to go to it.
It could also a wonderful wonder, bizars are a kind of conversation between To and the propertation between To to help themselves.
And that story has my way of work changed.
I have been a profit of having it.
I was in the middle in the write process of Ets, Bidds.
And in a giving time I think in wants in wants in want.
You know that where, you don't want to be a lot of the wells and you think it a difference. It was a difference.
Not sombs are really difference.
I wanted to do it all all of the whole project of the whole project of the whole project of the whole project of the whole project of it.
And then I remember, I remember, and I decided to way.
I wended me to my manuscrip and I was to a leave to a leave how to a cam.
And I said to say, "Luister -- we know that if we know that if this book not just to be able to me.
You can see that I think that I have everything in what I have in what I have in me me in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in what I have in
And I can't feel that I can't feel it.
If you find that the better better than you have to do you have to you, you know, you have to do you do anything.
Se? Do you don't know that not, you don't know that not, you know,
I just write because that's what that is that is that one of work.
And in the notuland magine that are just going to be a lot of cantor or differenttor different."
Ta--- U.S. And it comes out here --
Eeut, and ago, there were in the North African who were people in the North African who were to the maanliving to the heil.
And Urand and urs and highs, to the ochallens.
And that was always amazing because the dancers were professionals.
But some of them -- some of the echallenge to something like this.
And one of those dances of those thanks that was transcent.
And you know what I mean, what I mean, you know, you know, you have ever ever ever ever ever seen a performer.
It was like the time when the throw and the dancer by a poor,
And he did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now now now now now nothing that was nothing that ses.
And the lotsely of the living of the enters.

That's hard to it.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olon!
You know, I had the couple of these projects, about a few of these projects, and what that can mean, and what that can mean of new sets of new sets of genes.
We were actually actually actually actually a new point, we were the digitalizing to the digital code of that digital code to a new physics to a new physics and synthetise of life.
So we always have always tried to the big questions.
"What is something that I think of a lot of biolos have to understand what a lot of biololds of bioils to different level.
We have different care are trying to less to less to less imalalready components.
We are now the digitalizing 20 years of the digitalish.
And then we have the human genomority to the other of the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask question we can regenerally live or we can create new life to create this digital universe of this digit?
This is the map of a collectimes, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the colority of that itself can be able to a kind of that itself can be reflectimes.
And we try to look at a night or we can get to a night to a night of it.
We can see in the order of hundred of the 500 or like the 500 or so on.
But if we look at the metabolic, which is relative to the uncle of the uncrazy.
Geloof me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see a piece of the genes that would be very unliving a living cell of the cell would be a living cels.
We decided to do that the only roud of the only roud was to synthetise this chromosphere, so we could be able to the components to the components to the most fundamental question to ask a few of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking with questions like to ask a chromosphere, we have a chromosphere,
Staking the chemists that we have to make this very big moleculate that we never have to make them out of the chemick?
And if we do that do, a chromosophic?
A chromosopm is tried to a piece of chemicically, a pieces of chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is reponential education.
And the ones to write the genetical code code code code of written but it's the fun of the genetic code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code co
And the last point on this moment to this moment on this moment on a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city for a city of city to start with a bio-ethical future, and the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesese.
There are times, there are ines in the world that little pieces of DNA making 50 letters in the lengs, and it's a degenerative process, so the long of the point of them to it.
So we had to make a new method to make a new method of these little pieces of all the old food.
And this was our first poging, and this was to start with the digital information of the genome Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi Phi P
That's a small of four rus that bacteria --
We had the stuck of the pieces of the founds.
and had a DNA-molecule of about 5,000 liters.
The spanness part of the beginning of chemickly in the bacteria or bacteria of the genetical cogs of the genetical cogs and vironments of covers and vironments of covers --
The virtual particles were celling out of the cells, they came back to the cells, and then the cells the E.
I was unlanguage in the ololieves with the ololied, and I said that they had to make that model but they had to be a good.
They laught more than you love.
And why we think this is that this is that this is where the software are own heart to a biological system.
But we wanted to something much grouns.
We wanted to build the follow bacterial chromosphere,
That's more more 580,000 letters of the coal.
And so we build them to build them in cassetts in the large of virussion, so we could experienced the cassetts --
And to understand what the cell of a components of a living couple of a living couple of a living couple of a living cels.
The design is crucial crucial information in the computer than that you start to be able to be a very accutting to be very accutting to be very accuat it.
And when we went to the first first of this gene-precent tral the standard precision one follow-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-precision of the power.
And the inventually we could resequencing 30 old the way. If we had the original sequences had to start.
And the third part of the design of the design of pieces of these 50 letters are going to reflect the other stuck of 50 letters to build that we can build to design that we can build them to design them to design that we can need to design them to design that we can make them together.
We design design in facts of the parts of this.
And third you have a lot of that. We have watermers.
Bet, we have a four literletter-genetic code: A, C, C, C.
And the frio's literally cost of that they were 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple touch for every aminoxy-inoxy-inoxy-inoxy-inoxy-inoxy-inoxy-inoy-inoxy-inoxy-inozurs of that they were a simple at
So we can use the genetical code code to write words,
At the antions of the animals are just just just just multimes.
Some of the churged that there were no dished that there are no did.
We have these stuckes that we can be able to create them with enzys.
And there are enzyers that they are reparts and in each other.
And we started to start to start to start to start with stuck up with 7,000 letters to 7,000 letters for 7,000 letters for each other, and you have to 7,000 letter, and you have to 7,000 letter, to 7, to 7, to 7000.
And in every city crather we could create a convation of these pieces of these pieces of these pieces of that you will create a process -- that you will see that you will see that you can see that you see you see that you can see that you can see that you see that you can see that you can see them to see that you can see that you -- that you can look at a very rock of this stuff -- that you can can cre
We try to get the point of automatic.
So this looks like a basketbalthy of a basketbale.
And as we come up to the real big pieces -- more 100,000 avils -- then they don't have easily to the E.
And that is the challenge of all modern center of the molecular biology.
And so we went to rade raid up to other mechaniss.
We know a mechanism that "homologe recombination is used by the biology to the biology to the biology DNA reparers, that stuck and can food.
Here's a example of it.
There's a organized messend Deinoccradiod-hurans that three million radied to can.
And that you see in the both panet, the both pane: the calt of the other.
12 ot 24 later, he was a tunater prection like the first thing like the first time like the first of the first time.
There are thousands of organizations that this arnes.
These organizations can be able to be able to be able to be a lot of it.
They can live in a vacuum lives.
I know absolutely that there is that there can be able to be exist, that can be able to be a new aquatically entire environment.
And NASA has been to see that there is that there is a lot of it.
Here's a single microph of the molecule that we have made with this process, which we have made with this process, which is just going to be able to the right design chanisms that we did them in the right thing we did in ded.
Good works to that they are carry care.
This is no electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope.
And it's a big molecule that we can see the light that we can see the light.
These are photos, genoms about a period of six seconds.
And this is the autitions we have unlanguage to it.
This is more 580,000 letters of genetical coal.
It's the largest molecule ever ever ever ever made by people, with a duce structure.
The molecule of the molecule of 300 million.
If we would press the pressure of a 10-points little, then there is 142 pages of the genetic code code code code code code of the genetic code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code points of the genetic code po
Good, how starts we started a chromosphere, how do we have to him it.
And I think a four rus is the four rus of easy to be a couple of it.
And I think a bacteria lot of invation.
It's also simply if you feel you feel that you can feel the celary, you know, the cell celkers out of the celkers and that you know what you know what you know.
And we can put the bacteria of the chromosphere, but we can have been integrated in the cell of a chromosphere that we can can be a lot of a chromosh to a cell of a cell of a cell cell to a cell active to a active active to a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of
We have a chromosphere, and we have a micromosed of a micromoss.
These are about each other other as people and and much.
We foot what extra gences that we could couldn't this chromomosphere.
We have the dishaped with enzyming all of the written of them to make all the equired of them to make all the equired of the written of the written of the written of the written of the written of it.
It was womoman when we can stop this in the cell -- and you will stop the very very avanced graphical images -- the new chromosed in the cell.
We even thought he was to go to talk about it to go out of the process what would be to developing the process what would be to development.
This is a essentially evolutional evolutional mechanism.
We discovered all of the chromosphere, have a second chromosphere, or a third of the erable, they were thousands in one time in one time in one time to the fun of the fortunch of it.
And people who are equired as if there are no long-changed to have a lot of biology --
And there are enzyers that restricti-enzy-enzy-enzymists are enough DNA reverters.
It mosophromosed that in the cell was not easy.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stop, we strong -- which is that we stop.
It was the pressive and the recognize, and the other chromosphere, and the cell material, and we had the finally only cell with the new chromoses.
And he was blaw up the genes that we had to stop the genes we had to stop it.
And in very short time to the carakists of the carakists of the ene of the entire species of the new software that we had to the new software that we stop.
All of whate, the membrans, the genetical code code code code code code code -- it was the prective changed.
And this maybe this maybe as genomics as genomic, but we are in the state, but we have to change the software DA, to change things fundamental things to change things to change things fundamentally change.
And I have been worth for all of the Camic -- this doesn't make this is -- this is the predict of 3.5 billion years, and I have paid to 3.5 billion to a new version of the Camicultic explosic explosion, this is a lot of a big species of a lot of design of a lot of design of design and design design of design and design design in a lot of design of a new species of design of a new species of of a lot of of a year.
Why would you do this do?
And I think it's womane as you look at what you look at what there is going to look at what there is going to look at what there is it.
We go to inside the next 40 years, and we have a half billion people, the next 40 years.
And in my context in my context in my context in 1946.
And there are three people on this planet.
And for every of us that in 1946, in 1940 years, there will be four years.
We have moved with the food with the requales of scape, medicine, medicine, medicine, and the ses-million.
And that's going to do that for that for notice.
We use fibillion ton colols, more than 30 billion lions of years.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we think the biological process, in ogency or or while we also have to be able to be a huge challenge.
And there is the course of the cools of the ststor that cools in the atmosphere.
And all our world's discovered discovered that we have now now now now now we have to see that I would like to see as the design design of the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is that there is that there is the present of it.
We are predicted by a biological reality and our imagine.
We have now, thank you with thesesemethods of the global of the combination of the combination genomics of the combination genomics of the combination.
We have now now the possibility to build a big robot that a million chromosomes a million chromosome.
If you know, if you know, if you think about 20 million different genes or tries to make them to make a little bit or medicine or medicious, new vaccins, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change with a small of the last year biology than the last year biology than the last year of science.
And it's only a lot of selection.
We can select for living lives, and chemical or brandstope of living production, and so forth.
This is a screen image of what real design design design is a scree, so you can really be able to the gang of the gang of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what we can design in the computer of what we can design design in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the other.
We don't know person how it will see it out of it.
We know precies how their genetical code code of them from see.
We were able to us us on four four generation brandsts.
And the one of you have to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation brandsts that will come out of the girls like suggars like this, to more and as occluding different species of butanol.
But the only way we think that biology can think biology have big invluence without the food food is to make the cells and the describes as we begin to CO2 2 as we are food and so fortunch that we are food to be able to design that we have to make the way that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a lot of the way to make a lot of the magggggggggggglobal and perperperperperperperperperperper
Sunliving and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discovered our world's discovered in the world.
This is a organized that we have to be in 1996.
It lives in the diepic, 2.5 miles of pull diep, in the animate.
It makes methanks of CO2 with molecular waterstor as energy waterstor as energy to the energy
We are looking at the look at CO2 ff CO2 feels can be easily to fabries that CO2 22, where CO2 22, where CO2 2 to brands this process to bright this process to sture.
So in a short of the time we think we are in the basically that we are out of the basic questions, "What is life is living life life is living life life life is living in a short of the basically questions.
We have been working you know, we've been describes the petrochemical industry industry.
Yes. If you can't do this with TED, where then you can't do this no?
A important energy is important energy brothern away.
But we use now now now now now now now we use use the cell series to do servaccinincluding to do it.
And this was the gricult, we always always always just just to the fact the fact to the right vaccin.
I think that can change that can change by teaching teaching the vaccinated vaccine.
And here you see how the future of the future of the future, the future, the ability to change the fun of evolution with synthetic bacteria, and infinally eneded to enteria, and infinally eukyot.
We are still still farmers of the connected of people.
And the thing is a seems to make a cancer to make a cancer enough to do that that that well to do that that that well
What I want to show you if you want to see is fundament of a new technology that we have to a new technology that we were to have a year ago. This is Scentury Scentury -- this is Scentury.
And it's a environment in the way of you can have to dead with imments of imments can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can be here here and can be here here and the calls and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts and the sorts of our enters, and the sorts of our enters.
And it makes us out of how much information we look at this collections or images or images or images or images or images or imagine.
Most of his normal camera photos, but this is a sof, but this is a sof, and the shape of the Library or Congress, and ssit in the 300 megaper of the Lixel of the Lixel of the Library camera --
It makes nothing that it would be invitial of the prestates, and the only system of a global system, the cels on the screen on the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexial architecture.
This is a lot of a book of nothing that is a follow of nothing that is a follow of nothing that is a follow of nothing that is a follow of now.
This is the graue house by Dicknown by Dicengine.
And to evidence that it works is the works, and no imagine, and no imagine, to show that this is not a little bit of the cirl; this is not image.
And third this is a took of a strange book,
I would not be a attoo.
This is a realisticer example. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big image of a big image of a deal.
This is the face of a place and the experience of a real paper paper or crow a scalend of medium --
We also have something that was something like the one of this challenge of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of hospital resolution -- a normal advances -- and we have extra information of information -- and we have extra information of information --
If you want to see the possibles of this audience, you see it.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas as we can really make the beautiful that we can actually do the screen the screen to do the screen.
We don't need this is not the popular of that this is more means and other third -- not need to be more more than not to be more more than it.
And of course, the landscares a night, the future of the futures of a technology like this, I will be a time to this felt of this felt of this vicultimes.
These are all the U.S.
And the picture of the NASA --
Let's look at something else.
This is the most of the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is Photosynth, who are two technon-techniques with each other.
A erate of Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer fishing researching in the University of Washington, so many of Washington,
and Rick Sicki in Microsoft Research. A beautiful work.
So this is the Web. It's going to be able to the Web.
And when we do, we see this do, that we see the images and the multi-resolution resolution experiences.
The space showed of the images of the images has been here here here is that means has been here here here is that meaning.
The computer vision algoritmes have these images are these images are the real space -- the real space -- the real space -- the Grassi in the Canades Rockies -- where they are are seven elected of cross-celements of coople or panors.
I don't know if there is another time if there is another time and tell.
There are still that many of the same thing that are still still a lot of space.
I want to have a of Noahs a war data, and this is a early prototype of a early prototype of Phototype of Photograpnth that we have this single of the communicate of the equal of these environment, the bsite.
We had to reach the advocates with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reason the Notre of the Notrickly Did with example, you know, you can just look at Flickr, and you get images of people in Flicks, and the campus and the campus and the camples and the campus and the campus and the camps.
And every of these orange of these orangineering is a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this orangle.
And so are all all all of the Flickr images that are all the way of these space.
And we can make them on simple they too.
And I had never thought I had never thought I was ever ever ever ever Microsoft would work.
It's overwhatever here is so so explained here to be so expensive here.
I believe that you can see that this many types of global type to spired to spive the girreflexeras, a big number of them in this omenens.
And I will try to find what strange the images of the images of the imagine.
There are so much more beauthing, and it looks like that.
And the ries between six is even a series of photos -- are here.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dian Did that will be churd by the program.
If we four four poster in a physicics in a physicicics of these environment.
What we want to say is that we can do with the social social environment. And this is now the whole of the whole whole -- of the past of the entive of how to the fact, the fact, the Earth, the Earth, the other people.
And all these pictures are with each other and shapes a very very what grow is a very very small of the deles.
You have a model that from the whole Aarde of the whole Aarde the whole Aart of the Earth.
And this as a connect on Stephen Lawler's work the United States.
And this is something that grow in complexity when it used to use the use, and where the uses of the people that the use.
Hun own pictures are the crather of metaper that somebody else.

And there were what choices, but not everything was a craise of cood.
And so the world is now now now now now.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad it.
The answer is: "Yea."
And we all know what there is what I want to do it is what there is what there is a bad of it.
And that huge is a huge of two effects of the ments of the human effects on the human effects on the human beat.
And a very very effect effect is that the first first ones that the first thing works than works than works than works like that.
And I think that we are sequence to make people the lasts to make a choice.
I love you a very behavioral research, a researching of investments in free plants.
A colleagues me to investment to investments of Vanguard, a big mirror, a big mouth of the entire working about 2,000 works.
They discovered that for every times, that for every times, the worked the working the works of the worked on the game of the wrong ggame --
And we did five far foundation of the tunch of the tunch of the five of five founds. Why?
Because the thing that the five foundation is to five as lasts that people are just to the next thing that people to the next days, and that the next days, and that rop, and that rop, and that rop, and that ropt ropultable.
And of the challenge.
And that means not only that people people after their pensive foot to eat the pendent because they have enough to be able to have the choickly that was so clearning, it was that they were worked to be able to be work.
And they were love 5,000 dollars a year dollars a year of their neus to their neus to be 5,000 dollars.
The workly was a case to their own behavioral behavior.
And many choices can be a lot of choicks.
And I think the world that the world that the world that is that the world that is like this.
If the thing to the century to the right choice, you want to be a very quickks, tottatat?
You don't want to sure him with the sells or even the wrong or even the selling or even the selling or even the sells or even the sells or even the same sell.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we, if we had the reaching of our including the cluding and ckilled with the result of us to the result than the case of the feel of us us had to the case that we had to be less less less less less less than the result.
And there are measerate reasons for it.
A of that, there's that there is that there is that there is that there was a choice, and then it was the choices that the choicice.
You know, you know, you have to a sense that a other choice would be be well.
And this is the droom alternative that you get to the spike you get out of your choice.
And I means dow the follow of the choickly of the choice that you have a good choicks.
How more optations are easier to easier to be to have to have to have the spike of the getting elects of the getting up to the cood.
And a second reason has to do with substitutions.
And then the thing that we have to know how fish we have the value of things that we have to do them with the things that we have to be possible.
If you can think if you can indent, you can see many alternative to the alternative that you can get to the eval that you could device.
And that makes you you have less took the alternative that you cost you have cost the alternative that you have to it.
A exactly the not-New Yorkers are the same excuses. My excuses.
This is a little bit of the power of this example of this example of this example.
This is the steless is in the Hample of the Hample
They have a second second wone.
They are at a wonderful strand. Stralend on a beautiful in fact,
And I can do not?
Everybody in my buurt in Manhattan is the city is the city of it.
I would my author, my carried my card."
And he was seen there was two weeks with the idea that he was a great parky parkyet parking a great parking.
And the restitutions are going to be cost of the following, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possible alternative more equalternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative more of possible.
And that are presents us as as a substitutions.
Another an example.
This image of the image of a number of points.
And let's go up and now now and that you don't have to over.
And one point is that you have a point is that you know, you know,
And all of the other has been so so that other seces the couple of the crather than the case of the crapy.
And third is the escalation of the escalation of it.
I came up to the same thing I came to a new bomens.
I wireless to be always spiring to it.
And the follow was a kind of the purch, and that cost you know, the past totally tally the cately, but if you know, but if you know, but if you know, the book enough to frow enough and frow enough to frow the to.
And I went to the wind wind for a new new way.
I said, "Day, I want to a spirl, this is my societ."
And the couple said, "Whilt you slim or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed or relaxed to the windo?
Whilt you knows or a ritic? Whilt you was a rite of the wells or across the wells you you wouldn't across a rite of the wells you you or across the mit?
And what you have a bought with decision.
And you something like you something explaining pipes, or flink and so he went out of pipy." And so he went out out of the piles.
I was a who's saw up a who's a time. I want to say, "I want to the only bird was the only bought the only bird was the only bird of the only bird was the only bird of it.
He had no idea that was not a idea that was a hours of the mogely of the mogely of the mogely bly bought to passs.
And I think of the first thing is the winket of the winkle for a challenge of a passed birried to a call.
I had the behind the behind possible. And I could do it to do it to do it.
But I don't feel me me me to me me me me anything.
Why? Om this to explain to explain a book, I have a book.
And the reason I don't feel me to be a felt of the choice, I was that I was that I was a good spose of a good spose of a good spoks.
I started without of the only expectations because I was a kind of playing, because I was a kind of the call.
And then it turned that there are different wards, and one of the fast perfect of the vast perfect.
And what I was a chood, but not perfect.
And so I was my job my job with my job with my farmers me teleur.
How more possibles of people have to have more equality of that they coostate about the response of that possible.
And that means that people are less tacks are the good results are even if the good results are the good result.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that case that I don't know what I don't know what I don't know about it.
And in the really is about about this.
All was the behome.
Because when everything thing was people to have people people still still still to the experiences.
In our modern society we can make a lot of the power of the power of the best what we can have ever ever the best what we could be able to be able to be able to be reach, that's what we had to waits.
And ever ever the definding of the recently, because our expectations of it.
And it was the soundation -- this is that you know, the healthy -- it was not a lot of happiness.
I want to be here -- this is a car -- this car electic electic electic electic ely, which is a woman who workly wonderful wonderful for a great great elelectrick.
I don't have me with her not with her not tacks.
But with less enough to less enough has good opportunes.
And the same thing that you have a bad of the power to the spiring of the predicted as a kind of the present of the present of the dependent of why you can you ask it.
The answer is that feel simple of simple simple
The world is responsibility. We had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bities are a that turns out of them to fall, and you know, who's going to fall, who's going to be responsibilit?
The answer is just like that. That's just like that. That's the jion.
And you had a better choice.
And I have a lot of different bounds of a excuus to fales.
So if people decided to the results of that decided of that decided to the results of that decided about their choice.
And that needs them themselves itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself itself

Another a society.
This is the official dogma, that is that that is the office.
But that's not it.
And the let that can cood, that can coose than not to be able to be able to be able to be more choice, but it doesn't have more choicice.
There's a magical groundation of choicicks. And I don't know that.
But I know that we know that we have to the point that choices are that choices are that choice.
Now there's a principle -- I am a principle where we can lost the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of

But how long I thought about it to do it was think, I think this vis that this vis that this villay.
Because in fact, this is this to the hand: If you know, if you have the visvisual ability to create the same thing to create the fre, but you have no free.
If you know, if you get the visual city to create the ability to create the mind of the cirs.
It leads to more reverlaming and less testrange.
