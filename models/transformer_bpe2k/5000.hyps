This is more more more more than 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al c@@ o@@ c@@ e.
It's the f@@ ir@@ st is the c@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ , by a c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ , with a b@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ .

And if we have to t@@ al@@ k with the c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ s, with a p@@ u@@ t@@ ur@@ e of the p@@ u@@ t@@ el@@ y is 1@@ 0@@ 0 per@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ s, but it has a c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ on@@ , but it was a c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al c@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al c@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ on@@ .

We have more more more more more of the f@@ i@@ e@@ ve of the p@@ u@@ t@@ s.
O@@ n@@ e is that is that is that we sa@@ i@@ d a s@@ ur@@ n@@ ing that we have to l@@ oo@@ k to l@@ oo@@ k at a l@@ oo@@ k to be to be a l@@ oo@@ k to be that you to be a l@@ oo@@ k for D@@ on@@ g to be that you k@@ no@@ w@@ .
W@@ h@@ at if I want to see if you to see if you k@@ no@@ w@@ , it's a s@@ ur@@ n@@ ing a g@@ ra@@ in a ne@@ w of a g@@ ra@@ in a of a s@@ ol@@ lo@@ g@@ y of M@@ e@@ y M@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ s of M@@ o@@ g@@ y M@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ s and S@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ .

The f@@ ir@@ st of the f@@ ir@@ st of h@@ is the f@@ ir@@ st of the c@@ am@@ e of these p@@ u@@ t@@ ur@@ e is a b@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ f@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ , but it's a c@@ a@@ ch@@ ing of the L@@ i@@ de@@ d of the L@@ i@@ st@@ ar@@ s in the L@@ on@@ t@@ er of the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ y in the c@@ oun@@ tr@@ ac@@ k in the c@@ ar@@ s.
