Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the policy cap, which was the pooly three million years about the size three million years of the size of the United Statand was 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this particular problem is the serific problem because it doesn't show the disgusting of the ice of the ice.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showed is a accelerated version of what has happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is taken in red.
As you can see it down to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the window in the winter.
And the crazy.
The so-called ice ice ice ice ice ice or older, or parent, is almost like flower, that from the body is that from the body else of the body else of the body else of the body else of the body.
In 25 years of this is this to go to this forward.
And that is a problem because the frozen freress the Northern Icell warms, and there's a very big amount of frozen woman is carbon is that when it was death, when it was death, when it was taken by microbe.
And compared to the amount of diverse desert in the atmosphere, that could double that can double that amount that can double when we write the amount of difficult that we did.
In some indeep influence in Alaska sign methane on from the water.
And last winter was going to be a little bit of Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to immediately more imimprofound out of Professor Katey Walter from the University of the University of the University of Professor Kategor.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is the question is to be that we will be that are.
A reason for that is this huge "warm-bron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt melt two.
The waterle volume is the bigger than equal evolved.
This is the Kanger-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea is stile, because it teachs the lands melting in the sea.
These flow out of these flow flow out of flew it.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months reported scientists scientists that has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice in the Western of the South Pole is very quickly, very quickly,
The whole continent is to six feet sea lestying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after two after two after the size of the size of the biggest ice mass years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is gets the half of his drink-water water of that melers.
In the Andes, this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There's more flowing flowing out of flowing today.
But when they disappears also disappears as well.
In California was a 40 percent in the snowk of 40 percent in the snowk of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoices of water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions at the predictions are at the predictions are the predictions at it.
This global dream of drought has led to a dramatic stye-burning forest fuels.
And the number of nature. And the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the 75 years.
This pattern is completely untable.
If you look at it from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million ton CO2 ton CO2 every 24 hours.
25 mics ton every day in our oceans, look at the east area of the Stille of the Stille of America, and ahead to each size from the Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dealing of Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dealing of the ocean in the oceans.
The only big cause of warming, the global warming, next to deforest, which is to 20 percent of fossil fuels, it's burning from fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most of the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest excites, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centrales.
But we see a circle of circle.
These are the coal-carbon carbon that the body, became annuated in the last years, and where green alternatives were proposed to be proposed to the coalternatives were did.
There's a political fightforward to the high in our country.
The coal carbon carbon and oil industire 250 million dollars to promote "clean coal coal of coal of coal of cool --
And that picture was thinking about something about it.
And I was the churb, at home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons model.
You probably see it in the news.
This is the one after the biggest waste flow in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertisements of the bone-cow was desire round the Kersted was this one.
Video: "Frosty the coal carbon man is a key churchain is a couple of churchain the cool.
He's overfluence here in America, and he cares here in America, and he cares that our economy.
Frosty the coal carbon with the day rock guy.
He is paid and employees and employees their job."
Here comes a big part of the coal of the coal in West Virginia from from the following challenge of the coal in West Virginia from the coal in West Virginia from the coal of the coal compete of the coal compete of the coal compet.
The largest mines of the country is the great boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanwship ship -- "Let me be clearly agreed to be clearly -- Harry Reid, they don't know where they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the road.
This is a little bit of a little bit of it.
Video "BuCOLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threat for our business.
That's why it's the reason that it's the most important goal is to give a huge to give a giant engage to the light and bring the light and the detage of the bondness of bone-carbon.
Feit is, stead, crasmer.
We find that the clean -- and it still like's clean -- and it again.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just about us.
Video: Scrin: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern showed cools carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are making the machines are pretty much as a little bit of nois.
But that's the sound of clean cools technology.
And despite the fact that the branch of coal warming of the main causes of warming the global warming is the remarkable schone boney that you see here.
Look at good around and this is the clean technology of today.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: Stem: America is wrong in crisis, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wire is our dependence of fossil fuels, our dependence of fossil fuels, like vuil, and health,
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
And fat-America is 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to work on the work to work on a felt that took us and the warming of the Earth is to make the global warming.
And finally, a solution that considered enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Repower America.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Oh, it's going to be reinvent America
One of the quick ways to make an end of our dependent of old burnness of old fuels that our planet.
Man: Here's the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
And then 2: Not investments to create jobs.
Voice: Repower America. Time to become realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African speakword says, "If you want to be all of the way to be everything.
If you want to go far far about.
We have to go far about.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am here for the ones that didn't get -- the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever underneath nearbor.
It has to be the conditions that were supposed to be less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, so.
This is the machine underneat.
We took photographs of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one where I work. It's called the ATLA, AS. detector -- 44 meter in diameter.
Spectane-photograph of ATLAS in connections so you can see the scale.
And at 10 seeptember last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by AS.
That causes a partment in the control room.
It's a photograph of the first particle of the first particle that was going to go around the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which was flowing particles in the detector flow up with a blow-foot flow.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September we knew that was working on the machine, which is a huge over-wind-in-September is that the machine.
I don't know whether this was the greatest act, or this is when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page out of business that the Internet page.
That means we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact --
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golden behaviors.
And these behaviors ago, 13 thousand ample when the machine on full power works.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they are supermoked up on very low temperatures.
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, can be, that behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And that was a little bit warmer, and it was indicated electrical resistance against that 13 thousand ample of common.
This was the result.
This is still more impressive when you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons away, and they were about 30 inches -- and they were moved about 30 inches.
We had about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all have disseced at them.
Now they are back to road.
Eind map the LHC again.
We'll take it back and we'll expect measure to measure measure and we can go out and figure out what the building of the universe.
Now, of course, these unfortunately, they have started to reincidents the value of scientific research for a lot to difficult to be working on the debate of science.
I think it's fact that it's really hard to be so hard to go beyond than it equal -- the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words to English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have been able to decade the decade of the value of his teacher's life-day experiments of his teacher's Michael Farain, this said, "None is something that dangerous for the human mind that we have to take our imagery of science than we are science to take our images of science than mysterific that there are no new world's natural re, and that are not discussions in the new world to discussions in the world's natural science of science of science of human human beings of science that there are not to take that there are not exexist HHuster ance that there are not going to take a lot of scientist than than than mysterstersteric
Thank you very much.
I would like to start asking you back to your childhood to your childhood when you played with block block
When you had to grab it to grab it, and they cook and conscious, you were actually to solve it with the problems with and hands of space relationship with and hands of space relations.
Rumtelevision is very power because understanding the world to understand the world to us
If you an information inspired by the physical interaction of physical interaction with objects -- with my advise Pattion and my compassion and my compassion Jeeby Kalanithi -- what if we would ask -- what if we would use a computer that would be a computer of digital finger to a kind of digital finger to a kind of digital dehands that moves on a plate debureaudience, what you might be information be a little bit of information with the both of information with with the neighbors of information that we can do is is is is is is to be information that we can instead information of information that that that move information with the bodisplay information that would have a little bit of the neighta little bit of the same thing that that that
and can ordering as we want to do it?
This question him is so that we decided to find an answer to find an answer, by building Sifttables.
Cort cook-Siftable computer size a computer size of a cow-cooky.
They can feel with the hand they can feel their movement, they can feel their movement, and they contain a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handel-blocks as blocks can they get into the blocks to grab it.
And the top of the Sifttables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of ways of digital information.
And this is that this aid resources have a more physical differently, their movement and from each other, and even of the way we move them from each other, there are different new and fun interactions to discover and fun interactions to discover and fun interact with it.
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that plays by the offices and others and otherset others and others' opposed to play a cell of the cell of the cell played to play a video
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will interest to interest for each other.
And if they are surround, they can also take this and what nervous weight.
And they feel movement movement.
We realized algauw that one of the interesting consequence of this interaction, the use of everyday bare gears of gears -- as it was a fluid as it was a fluid as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid of color as it was a fluid comes, as it was a
In this example three Sifttables emmers to go and take them color in a emmerge in a emmerge in a empty of emergency in a emerge.
And if we have threw over the little bit of a little bit back.
There are some of the craft opportunities for education, precedented playful game of language, mathematics and logic that we want to give people fast quickly, and the result immediately, and the result immediately,
So here I'm -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci by a simple account programmate.
So here we show you a cross that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single shake letter on every Siftle, and send words are controlled in a dictionary words are controlled in a dictionary book.
After about 30 seconds it is very rescue, and appears a new series of letters with behind opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in it and I'm in it and make them out to get a video of it.
They were actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people don't need instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people test it.
That's our youngest ber boar, righte.
And it turns out that he was going to go to the Siftttables would.
For him were only blocks.
Here's an interactive paintingly painting.
We wanted to have a platform for learning language of language language
This is Felix that demo.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Sifttask that character of the table of the table.
Here he leaves the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
God daan! Yeah!
And by Siftttables and the needle to places and the needle to go to the characters with each one -- Video: Wowing it.
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end of an open end of an open end of an open end of an open end of an open end of an open end.
and he decided to deal with it.
Video: The cat flying away.
DM: The last example I'm going to show you today Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed with a sound of sound that we developed the lead, bass and pressure and pressure precise and pressure pressure and pressure precedent and pressure pressure that we have developed
Eender has four different variations, where you want to choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the arms can be injected, so you can determined the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern in the pattern Siftar.
You put a sound in the pattern by the decade of a lege Sifttable effects of a livable effects of available effects and filter.
They get a sound took and applied by the office,
And if the general effects like tempo and volume that are tacked up the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We start with a liad in two Sifttaples, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I place the basline.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to add some slagworks.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the print, so I can affect live the effect live can affect the effect live on the effect live on the effect lives.
Video: I can get it very accelerate by the offices of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can repair the pattern as it looks like playing.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything else and make improvise and shorter as I want.
And with the finally dimitted the dimmazing Sifttable to operate the left Siftoot to the left Siftoot to the left Siftar.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion is to make new people, my passion to make new people, and you can see the way our brain and bodied in the way our brains and bodied bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area that we have a new elemental opportunities that we develop in the lab.
The thought I am I like to bring about is that this is only the atsize to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interacts with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to talk to you with all of you all of you all of you all of you to talk to you.
I'm writer.
Books writing is my work, but also writing more than that.
My entire life for for a long life, and I don't think that that will change.
And yet there is a little bit of ownership in my life and career and career and career with my work to see my relationship with my work to see my relationship to see my relationship to see my relationship and career.
It started a book that I wrote unfree that I wrote unfre, "Een, Bidden, Beminnera -- that very very very opposition to my earlier work over the world was going to be international existseller.
The consequence is that people now have to go everywhere, and always told me as if I do I do job.
And the thing that -- gets dom!
People come to me and ask questions of questions that you can't get this success, you can't get this succes?
Don't you remain your entire life will be write your entire life but never published to publish a book that people are going to write a book that people are going to write your entire life will write your entire life will write your entire life is going to write your entire life but never a book of your entire
Don't you get there?"
It's rg disappower, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get success, you don't get succes?
Don't you know that far to be surprise to go on on to be surprise to be on it.
Don't you know your life on this work is going to be a living on this work without that there will be a little bit of your broken on the puin of your broken with your mouth with your mouth of fail?"
Something in that stretching the streting.
And in the short, my answer to that questions on this novely is to say, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all of these things that are called "
All of the time
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid many other things job, you don't want to know what it does.
For sea for example, and other enge things.
But what is writing myself is writing myself the last time I writing with the last time when that fear comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be afraid to work for work that they have been seeing their opinion on Earth?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to be the effects of the effects of the minds of the minds of the mind of the mind works.
Take my father. He was chemists engineer, and I can't remember that there was a chemist, and I can't remember somebody has ever asked somebody to have somebody was asked him for it.
And so of course, "John, how did it with your chemist?"
No, as it was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been chemists by the centuries through the centuries of reputation for a manic, to be a male depressive alcoholists.
Scheaters writers have this kind of reputation.
Not only writer, even more of people have apparently apparently in human beings are pretty instable.
Look at the grimming death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many dieted young, often by own too.
And even the ones who don't seem to be suicide, under their gave to be under to be their highly seem to be their suicide to be a suicide of their gave to be suicide.
In the last interview for his death said Mailer: "My each of my books is a little bit of my books is a little of mitself display of myself."
That's a kind of little to say about your life-work.
But of this kind of quote we don't look at it.
We heard it all earlier and have heard it with my slides.
The sophisticated is that creativity is unlocked to be innecessary with suffering and that a artistone is going to lead to miserable to read to misere.
So why do I want to ask everybody here today do you with that idea life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think about it, I think it's not a pretty much thought.
I think it was resident.
And even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century this century is so on.
We can spore a lot better better than we can spore a lot better live.
I know that it would be in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark dark for that dark in the dark of my thought.
Sore the stage in which my career is now in my career.
Go took a young year.
I can spend four decades in front of decades.
And Hopposed to be all I'm going to publish all of the outside world as the work that is that followed in that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can cut it up, you know, highest success is my greatest success for me.
Jemig, what an idea!
And if you go to think about it, you know the morning, you know the morning, for the morning,
So I don't want to want to be that.
I love to work that I love the work that I like to work that I like like this.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long after I have come to the conclusion that I can just go through writing as a psychological protection in the process of building in the process of building in the process of inside the process.
I have to write a safe distance between myself and my convert desistance between myself and my conversation to my future publicly published to the reaction my future published publations.
I did the last year, I did did for ways to do that.
I'm in history, and I do do a lot of history, and deeps in other civilizations to see whether others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My quest has brought me to the old Greeks and Rombs and Rombs.
And let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombs and Rombs people didn't have that creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity was a godlessly distant to human beings that from a display to human beings acknowledge and unknowledges.
The Greeks called these choices of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates, believed he had a demon that he had a demon that he words him words him --
The Romends had a species of equal idea.
And in them was a genius of a genius called a "genious genius "genious genius
The funny is that the Rombs with a genius with a genius to a gene pience a gene person to a gene person to be a particular.
In their policy was a gene kind of magic godddomic entities that were in the walls of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the huge of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house.
And when the artist was working on the work was genius assistance.
And the idea of the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work in his work
The artistic was so in protection to be protecting in a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant work, you didn't get all the honor for it.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius you had helped to help you.
Do you work on your work was crowed to you crazy.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genia.
Lar time is that considered how in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was changed to do
And there was a very new idea: the individual human individual human individual human beings and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, and, from the goddle-stuff world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual present of the individual case.
And for the first time in history was about artists there was about artists said that they were a genius and they didn't have a genius genius.
I have to say I think I need a big fromed wrong --
And to let one person, one single individual to believe that he or she is the vehicle is the essential, the source of the century mystery, of everything else is to responsibility for a fragiment, is a lot of responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun in swallowed to swallow a sun to swallow the sun in the sun in the sun.
Ego's become embishing to huge proportion, and there are increasingly expectations to prestations to prestensient to prested performs.
And I think this pressure has been the last 500 years of artists capo has made a lot of artists of artists have been making a lot of artists in the last 500 years of artists of artists have been making a lot of artists in the last 500 years of artists have been making a lot of artists of artists the last 500 years of artists have a lot of artists of artists have a lot of artists a
And if that's so if I think is the question: "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between human beings and the creative mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years we can rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes to speed.
Probably in the audience people who have recently recently reduced scientific creatures with some of the idea that elfollowing the work of artists with some feeent of the work of artists.
I don't seem to get you all of you in there.
And yet me demand it.
Why does not?
Why wouldn't we do that thought don't want to do that though,
It just fromed as much as much as much as all other explanations of totally calculated uncalculate in the creative process.
Everybody who have a little bit of trying to create -- so actually all the asses, all of the attacks -- you know that the creative process is not always rational message rational process is not always rational mous.
It is a little bit of almost paranormal.
I have the great American denominal American closer to the great American denominant American denominal American density American closer to the amazing American denoms.
She's a thick in the nine. Her entire life already writing them.
She told me about her youth on Virginia.
Some of them in field to the work was felt to the work was felt to the poem in the country.
It was so so she said, "Well, as if there was a big wave air came out of a wave air
And so poem than the country to her country to her across the country to her --
She felt that the ground underneath her feet began to do her at that point, and she knew that she was going to get one thing to her life.
And she ran home, and she had to get the poem and then she had to do as fast as possible and then paper and pakick paper.
When the poem was poem by her hength was that her only opportunity to writing it on her honor was to write it on her honor was to write it was to write it was to write it was her honor.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly.
Then and roughly it home of them, but couldn't reach the house of the house.
And at the moments of the poem by her him, and disappeareas -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another poet.
And even though I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- I think it was the beautiful part of the story -- they were almost miste.
And then she was in home and sit for paper and paper, and shake it by her him.
Juist at that point, she had a potased to take a potased to do it.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she was told me them, she was pushed the poem from the sky.
She paid it close to his tail, and it back into her body, and it back into her body, and she wrote it back into her body,
And in that cases came up with the poem was in the beautiful of paper, but in conversation in the entire following honored.
When I heard that -- what is accident, what is accidently, my creative process too!
That's my creative process isn't working on a creative process of not!
I'm a mouth, which is a muilevel, which is on the same time chair and trans on the blood and trans through it, sweeping it to get blood.
But even in that daily swine day. I had a experience.
You will also know it ourselves, that feeling that there is a sense that there is creative ideas in your recording from a source that can identify impossible identify impossible to identify it as well.
What is that for bringning?
How can we use it without we'll use it without we'll be able to use it without we'll use it without we'll use it without we'll use it without we'll use it without we'll be able to use it without we'll be able to use it without that we become a little bone?
At a way that is good for us to do it?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a lot of his life is a lot of his life was showing the toon-image of the craft artists that are trying to get out of all power to the unfine of the unfront of the unconfine that taken in him.
And it was Tom a little bit more more rustiger.
One day he reached in Los Angeles over the freeway the freeway the freeway the cradical
And as he heard about that, he heard a clip of a melodie.
The decided that is to be like inspiration that does inspiration that does inspiration -- cating.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashion it.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper, no paper, no paper, no taneously at it.
The well-known excited, and then the meloil, "I reach the melodie, and then it stays to me eterness, it remains century.
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't get in panic, but he did something news.
He looked at the air and he said, "Sorry hear, can you don't see that I behind the sense of the well.
"Do you really think I can write a songle of son?
If you really want this song, you have to get later, you have to take another when I have time for you've got time for you've got to get a time for you,
And not, you know, somebody else fall.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that point is losing the process of very different.
The work is the work is the same thing to the known dark of the known dark for the known dark itself is the known dark itself is the except of the worth dark itself is the known dge to the same dark
But the heavy excited that the creative process in him operate the regular process in him of genia.
The gene was going to close to the skin, and supposed to the skin,
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to the rest of it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the profoundation between Tom and the ownership of Tom itself was a bad of Tom itself was in the way of Tom itself was a kind of conversation between
That story has changed my way of works.
I had a profit of it.
I was in the writing process of Ets, Bidden, Bidden, Beminners.
And at a point I'm astone, I despake in despath.
You know that you don't want to be working, but you don't want to be a terrible disaster disappoint. The book is a terrible book --
Not just a bad of bad -- really terrible bad of it.
I wanted to do the whole project to all project.
And I remember Tom that was remember, and I decided to be a pose.
I wonder my manuscrips and focus cripped to a very empty corner of the room.
And I said, "Lister thopers, we know all of the way that if this book is not only that if this book is not only coming by me.
You can see that I have in the way I have in the way I got in it.
I can't give you a lot of it.
If you think it's better to be better than you have to get your thing to get to your thing.
Snake? Do you don't do that, you don't do that,
I just writing because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notants are suppose that is just a way to be a chancle of office."
Tja--- it's going to come up here on this --
Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people together to dance in month, to dance in month, to dance on sacred music.
Oren and hours and hours, to the morning.
That was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, some very much evolved in a particular.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, what I mean, you have ever seen a lot of performer.
It was like the time was stillustrated and the dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights and now catches everything together.
And he didn't seem to be a human beings a human beings a human beings a human beings for a human beings to be a human beings a human beings longer just a human beings.
In him, under him blown it.
A godddant fire.
And if something that happened to be people who were going to be Dan them what it was Dan them to clap and crops, God, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a fun historic fact, when Moren Spain-Spain-Spain-Spain-Spain-Spain-Spain-Spainting.
The quote is the century by the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah."
That hear you hear the day at the day at at the day at flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artist in Spain Spain something impossible, or magic, and you say, "Allah, oil oil -- all of the way --
And understanding -- a glimpse of God.
And reciipe what we need.
Lasty is the dancer that the dance of dancer the dancer tomorrow to the launch 11 o'couldn't be godd-foot lads.
And at that moment, he's a little bit more parently, with couldn't get to such a little bit of the high-hights.
Maybe there will never be somebody God anybody to do anybody whose to be dance.
What does it have to the rest of his life?
That's hard to be hard.
That's really hard to selecrotate for a creative mind.
But it's not going to be that not to be too to be there.
Imagine that you don't go from explaining that the most immediately aspects of your person from yourself.
And imagine you believe that you have them to be a while, a while,
When you are, they get down on someone else.
And so considered everything.
I hang inverage that thought to be thought to be thinking about it.
And the last months I've been working on a book that will short. The book that will short. The book where much to go to reach out to excited.
The operation of illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me on the hall, I like to go and go and the same on: You know, you don't see it.
Do just you work.
And just you do thing -- you know, whatever it is.
If you have task your task, you go and dancing.
If the goddly gene genius to make a leave moment to make a little moment in your work at some point at some amazing source, then "Oly!"
And not excited, then, then, but it was going to go through it.
And also "Oling!"
I believe that of heart.
"Oh, well, whatever, because we want to stay human love and property equality to keep plumness,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discover of new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the biology of digitize, and now we try to go from that digital code to a new fase in biology and synthetishing synthetthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levelaus.
We tried different approaches to bring it back to minimal minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years.
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the analoge world of biology, to the analoge of biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for life to regenerate life, or can we create new, we create new, out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can multiply in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can get a nature smaller.
We can go into hundred genes out of it, and you can go out of the 500 or whose are.
But if we look at the metabolan map, that relative to the relative to the impact with the unnerrow of the crazy.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can cheat a point that we can switness that this would be a living cell cell.
And we decided to that the only route predicting this chromosome was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like to questions like chromosome of a chromosome of syntheses?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we've never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome "restart?"
A chromosome is but by the way, but a little bit of chemically, a little chemictic inds material
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is accelerator is accelerately,
Our ability to write the genetic code rather rather slowly slowly, but is accession.
And our last point it would put on this moment in a moment,
We're going to have over 15 years ago.
There were some stages for a few stages for a bio-ethic devication preceting pre-remote remotion to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to DNA is very hard to DNA is very hard.
There are decade of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lengd, and it's a degenerative process, so much more than you make it pieces of the more false.
So we had to make a new method for the new method of these little pieces and correct the correct of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of the errors of these little pieces and corrigate of the errors of the errors of these little little pieces of things.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, did the foutcorrection
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the beginning of a chemical chemical chemical trial in the bacteria genetic code, and the bacteria genetic code, and make viral particles and make viral particles and make viral particles and make viral particles and make viral particles went out and make viral particles started to make a little bit of the bacteria
The viral particles were when I was did, they were going to get back and they came back and killed the E. coli.
I was speaking with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said they were that model but all too well.
They laught more than you laught for more than you laught for more than you laught more than you laugh.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build its own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in viruses, so we could vary the cassettes --
to understand what the conceivable components of a living cell.
The design is critical critical information is critically, and if you start with digital information in computer than that digital information is very accuraat.
When we first did this genome for the first time was the default was the default for one mister per 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 mists. If we had the original sequence than it was not in the war than starting to start on it.
And depart of the design of pieces that 50 letters long as it comes up to the design of pieces of 50 letters to all other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to design together.
We design unique parts in the fact of these unique parts in here.
Maybe you have read that we were able to stop watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-liter-genetic genetic genetic code: A, C, Great and T.
Trios of that letters code for roughly 20 aminosances -- that there is a single inoxygen for every aminoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write, so-writing, so.
And in fact, we just catch a sign.
Some of them were disappointed that there were no poems.
We have this pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of casking, begin with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters long, only that you have pieces of 24,000 letters of 14,000 letter, take it to 72,000.
In every stage diump we week a translate of these pieces so we could sequences because we want to create a process that is very robust, that is very robust -- that will be very robuying -- you can see straight.
We're trying to achieve the point of automatism.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as soon as we get to the real bits -- more than 100,000 baseparts -- they don't grow as easily more in E.
That does explain all modern tools of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-o-combination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can ade.
Here's an example.
There's a organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiodurants that three million radiation to the radiation of radiation to the radiation of radio radiation of radio radio of the radio of the radiation.
That is in the top panel, sopm square just set out of chromosome from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later and he put it back to each other,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can dry droughly dried up.
They can live in a vacuuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space, that can find life in space, that can find a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show that there is a lot of this is a lot of that there is a lot of here.
Here's a deeply micropto of the molecule that we've made with this processes -- actually with this processes -- actually with the right design of the bits with the right design of the pieces that we did in it.
Gist cars for it car to cut automatic.
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photographs, taken about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we spent unroad.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code.
Now, how do we started a chromosome chromosome chromosome of the activate it?
And it's clearly pretty easy is clearly pretty easy.
And a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a bird of eukaryots, like us, you just weep, you knew the cell and does another in, and that's what you know when you know when it was reading.
And in the bacteria species of chromosome, and we can do have a full transplantation of a chromosome.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microms.
These are about as far as far as people and much.
We used to take some extra genes so we could select this chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the way to this chromosome.
We have the single with enzymes to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the proted.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will have the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome in the cell.
We even thought he would come to so, but we tried to go to set the process little process to develop the process of what further.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have taken a second chromosome of third chromosome of them from one time that they add thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution is predicting evolution to have a lot of biology changes that has not been much biology much biology much biology has been going to be a lot of biology
There are enzymes that restriction enzymes that are actually called DNA.
The chromosome that was not in the cell was not to eat.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put in it --
It was expressed, and it recognized the other chromosome of the chromosome of the material -- and so once we had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was blue the genes that we had in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the characteristics of one species, and he changed to the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell.
All proteins changed the membranes changed the genetic code, it was changed to the genetic code, it was changed.
This is a long time than sound software in the enomic alchemist, but we're in the software DNA, to change things fundamentally change.
Good, I paid earlier to this is not a creation of creation -- this is previous -- this is previous for 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid an explosion of Cambran explosion of Cambric explosion of Cambric explosion of this digital new species of measure of measure new species of meant to this digital design of this digital design design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly when you look at what it needs to what is needed is.
We're going to go including six-and-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 46; within 40 years.
We have trouble with food with food clean water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collapsed coly.
That's 100 milos per day.
When we take biological processes in the ogency processes or what process is to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course, all this carbon dioxide of the stycle that comes in the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discoveries we have now to have a database with about 20 million genes, and that would like to be the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had but a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We're very far behind by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thanks to do now,
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about 20 million different genes of genes or trying to optimalizing processes to optimalizing octan octan immediately team of drugs, new vaccinins, we can change a little team.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select for life-fatbarity, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen map-mazing imagination of what real designer is where we work on the high and a new kind of on the computer.
We don't know what it will see out of what it will see.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth generation fiels.
And along you have seen to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation fuels that will come out of sugar, like sugar, to more high-digit fuels like octan octan octan arraise of butano.
But the only way we think we think that biology can have big food without the food prices higher and the availability is to lay availability is when we start his food supposed to design that we are vision, and so we are doing it in that way, and we think we do the first fourth generation is that we do the first field generation of the first 18 months.
Snonlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we've described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, and a half miles deep, in cooking heavy test in the deep.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sources as energy source.
We're looking at the whether we can take CO2 2, which is easily through painting through fabraces, where that CO2 to be form to send this process.
So in a short of time we think we are able to expanding to the basal question: What is life?"
We real, we have a real matter -- the devices of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where?
A important energy source.
But we also work on this tools to be using these tools to be able to think.
This year there was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts of the facts of vaccine.
I think that can change by teaching of textomored vaccines.
So you see what the future can see here is going to change the evolutionary tree is going to change the accelerating bacteria, and eventually archeukaryota.
We're still aware more of improving people.
Our goal is certainly to make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive to survive that might be able to do that might be doing.
What I want to show you as a little bit about is a fundament, the fundamental of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft rock -- this is Seedragon. This is Seehahavior.
And it's a environment that you locally or at the distance of immense amounts of visual data can work for a lot of visual data can work
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can keep down down to the sace and cut out of the case and the sorts and the sorttery to our ewish to our wishs.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at it, how big these collections or images.
Most of them are normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel --
It all does nothing because it is the only thing that was the prestations would affect to a supposed to a system the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a completely book, an example data.
This is the graug house by Dickens. Each coluck column.
And to prove that it's actually test that it's really test and not a imagination, we can do something that is really test to show that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read a strange way to read a e-book to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a very strange way to read a little bit strange way to read a little bit strange way to read a little bit strange way to read a little bit strange way to read a little
I wouldn't do it for a lot of it.
This is a realistic example. This is a degree of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a subject of a subject.
This is really a pleasure really a pleasure of a real paper, paper, or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium.
We also did something that we did with the corner of this expensive of The Guardian.
We made a nick advertise of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertise -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the ability of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure we can do the limitations of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen from handle of hands,
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other things things like to be flawwwo-ups -- not needed to be more popular flawws.
Of course, naturally a for the hand is to be a technology as this one, I won't spensive here to spend up here -- except that we can contribute to be a lot of contributon.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top of the NASA
Let's look at something else now.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connects two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoy to the University of Washington, ago from Washington, award by Steve Seitz at University at University at University at University on University of Washington, and the other thing is at University of Washington the University of Washingtton, and the
and Rick Sself, Research. A beautiful cooperation
So this is live on the Web. It's suppose possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see this -- you can see that we experiences and the multi-resolution.
The space shake of the images has been here meaning is here is meaning in this way.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images are brought to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadese Rockies -- where they're genomes -- where they are taken upon you see elements of stabilized diassediased diased diassible, and all these things are space diassc space --
I don't know sure or there is another environments to show you some environments.
There are a lot of space more space than that.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynthesize this summer -- to the communicate what I've got in my head is the reality of the real force of this tech, the reality of the environments on our website.
We had to do it with the lawyer and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get the circle, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the circle, and the circle, and the circle, and the circle, and you get the circle, and you get the cr.
And each of these orange chain gives a image again, that was part of this model turned out to be part of this model again.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are copied in this way of flaped in this way of Flickr
And we can do a simple way way to navigate a nature nvice.
You know, I never thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft would work at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so untouched to be so under to be so unrase.
I believe you can see that this many types of cameras is that all of glexcameras, a big reflexcameras, a big number of it, consider, a lot of it,
I'll try to find some strange a strange images.
There are so much working on faces and so much of faces and so on.
And somewhere between the one of these are -- you know, there are a series of photographs -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is churated by the program.
If we take through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do things with this is that we can do things with social environment, the data of everybody -- from the entive memory of the entive memory of it, and the Earth is looked at -- and everything else that everybody on each other.
All these photographs are conclude together, and shape together than the som of the parts.
You can have a model that you have a model that from the entire Earth.
So this is a following on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Ad:
And this is something that growth in complexity when it uses the use, and also the previous of the people who use it.
Their own photographs are being being able to somebody else into a little bit of metap-data that somebody else invoted.
If somebody would like to clip their names and their names and their names and their names and their names is reverse wearch with all of that data, and I can use as a access to the space, that metap-versu, usmaking photographs, and create this metape versus a kind of cross this kind of crow-model, and created with this kind of cross space and created with all of these cross the circle of cliff.
And of course, the side product of this immense of immense wealthy virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only photographs, satellite imagery and other applies is to the collapsatelies; it is aware of the collapsed from the collapsed -- but also out of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes your software possible to a day, in the next years, all the images that can be did, all the images that can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered is discovering.
It creates, to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the data in the data in the data in the images.
And that is getting exciting when you think about the wealth when you think about semantic information that much of semantic information that much of these images are available images available when you think about the wealth of these images are available when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is available to available when you think about the wealth of semantic information that is available when you think about the weat.
When you look at the web page of images, you following a search in the webpage and the text, and the textest on what the image represent.
What if you care that copied to all your image images?
Then the number of semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that, in fact, it's a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and of enographics is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live between those who are not forget to feel in the wind, the touched straight in by rain the wind, the profitting in the wind, profishing in the wind, the profishing parently.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky Way Way Way Word to be the mythes of Inextent with meaning the Himalaya boodhunt of Dhars still yourself to the dem of Dhar, you remember the anthropology of anthropolog: the world that we live in an absolute but is not a absolute sacross single one as a model of the angame of the angalalalalready Wore is still
the consequence of a accidentally, adaptation choices that made our ancestors of generations adapty.
Of course, we all parts all the same debt require remain: Words children in the world.
We all make all inform indicate it.
And as a desire difine distinction by death.
So it can't be surprise that we all of side, and dances and have art.
But interesting is the unique chadapted and the ritm of the dance of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodoo-acolites in Haitian or the U.K. D. Culi-desert in North Kenya, the Curture of the Curn Kenya, the Caravanai ban in the heart of the Sahara. This is the man of the Sahara. This is the man with the desert of Quacian --
Everest, the godddddin-mother.
They all are us all that we can think we be able to think different, different, our can think of us to be differently.
And if you think about it, you can only give this idea of idea you can only give you hope.
Samen forms the intelligic cultural life that is a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important as the biological lifes: the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine as you can imagine as an enosfer --
The enosed fetaring in the entirely of all the thought, if the totally of all thoughts, mythes, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are previous by human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness.
The enosed is the big nalature of humanity.
She's the symbol of all of that we can be and all of that we can be as amazing newsgible animals species.
Not like the biosphere is swhere there is tast the enosed is that eatsoes -- and even in much larger mate.
No biologist would be far to work that least half of all species at least at the point of all species on the point of extinction is not true.
And right that, the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of losses.
When everybody was born there, there were born sixousand languages on Earth were born on Earth.
A language is more than her word or her grammarket or her grammarket is more than her words.
A language is a language of human soul.
It's the vehicle that is the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century ancient old old -- a shift, a thought, a shift, a thought, a thought, a thought, a thought,
And from that six-thousand languages today the day of not more in childhood to fluid in childhood
They don't get babies longer to be babies to be longer too.
Effective means that unless a change require, that they are dead.
Is there something like a little bit more single than the last of your people, the last of your people, the last of your language is to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the children have to see the kids of the children have to see the children tege?
And reciiies that tergenous is somewhere on the Earth, every two weeks to somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks and dying to him the last letter of an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, wouldn't be better place to be better place, if we all were talking to the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantone: Or Kantone."
Or Kogi., you will have to realize how it could not talk to you to talk to your own language to talk to your own language.
So what I want to actually do is to take you on a short journey by the etnosfer that has to sketch a image of what is actually removed in what is actually lost to be refrigeration.
And many of us that when I have it about a different way of being in a different way of it," I also really mean.
Take this Barasana-child in the North west-Amazone, the people, the people, the people, that believes out of the anaconda, that she has the flowing river of the eye of heavy sacks.
This is a battack that cognitive the colors of blue and green big, because it is the violent of the odd of the odd of the odd of the odd of the odd of the own.
They have a singuissue and marriage of answer rup, which is called linguistic exogamy -- you have to somebody whose married a different language.
This has his roots roots in the mythological past, but the extraordinary completely in their homes, where six or seven languages or seven language, but you never hear someone language.
They listen to just just speak and then then they start talking about.
One of the fascinaterant stem that I have lived with the Waorani in North Ecuadorn, a amazing inside which in 1958 followly was required contact was required contact with became a displayer contact was resed.
In 1957 five missionaries five missionars, but they made a critical error.
And it is the air flow flows of herself to our ideas of our ideas to our ideas that they remove that this has never been a two-dimensional image had never seen a two-dimensional image image had never seen a two-dimensional image had never seen a two-dimensional flow power to our ideas they were not from a second-dimensional friendly
They got the photographs and tried to find the shape behind the face behind the face behind the face behind the face.
When they liked up with concludes they were that the duivel that the duivel with spears to this is that the missionaries were going to speak with spears.
But the Waorani didn't only excited, but also each other.
Fifth of their death fresher came out of breaking out of breaking out of deaths
We could take genealogies to eight generations back to eight generations back to eight generations of a natural death.
When we were wondering, they gave that one man ever died from old one of parently, he was going to be but the same time they had an amazing shaped amazing shapes of the oerwin of the oerwalism of the oerwiding of the oerwalancement.
Their hunters, their hunters were sure to 40 desires desires from which animal as the one was the way.

And to understand of this sensational things that can understand what to do is a little bit about this particular, I had to learn something about this particular, which is not a cult of black magic.

Would I ask you the big world's great religions, what would you say,
Cristendom, lam, islam, etc.
One continent is always considered to consider to be considered by Africa had no religious beliefly they had this beliefly they had this to.
And Voodoo is simply the destilling of this profound religious ideas, spread in the tragic diaspora during the tragic diaspora during period.
What vodoo is so interesting is the living between the living between living and the deaths and the deaths the deaths and the deaths of living and the death.
The living bars the spiring.
The minds can be emerged to be under the Great Water, response to the dancing of the living times the soul of the living time, so that in the soul of that one wonderful moment the following is the god.
So why are foodom, "You blank you to go to the church and talk about God.
We dance in the temple, God." And because you're so conversation by the spirit, what can you happen by the mind, what can you happy?
This leads to a amazing tone-foot following full flows in trance that streffelectricity to tasts.
This is a tunate demonstrate the ability of the mind to influence when this is in extreme when this is in extreme is extreme as extreme is

Now they're education in the lawsk of the big mother.
These whole time them are the society have been building in society that are considered to be that only held the cosmic or ecologicical.
This invention is endying with the day they have to come out and get it to the first time in their life, if they are 18 -- a sunness of consciousness, as the Son that clearly hells of the first bottom of the cleaning landscape with her light, as it has learned everything that she learned abstract in full set in the entire fact in full glory. The princisters say: The priess.
"See? It's like I said you have saying you.
That's how it is real. It's real. It's protectemporary to protect itself the older brother.
And I think that are the younger brothers, which are responsible to the destruction of the world.
And at this pointuitive is very important.
If we think of inheemerge to follow landscape, we often Rousase Rousase in the old factor, a sense that racistic in his simplicity.
Or we say we are Thoreau and say that these peoples at the Earth is closer than us.
Inheememisse folks are nor expected by nostalgy.
For both is in the malaria motion of the malaria motion of the Asmat or in the ice winds of Tibet. Desalniance temporary of the Earth, and ritual mystic of the Earth is that not in the idea of Earth is a lot of subtactor is based on a much subtle of subteming to be the idea that the Earth is the idea that the Earth, the idea that the Earth, the idea that the Earth can be only awareness is the living.
What does that mean? It means that a little kid from the Andes, which is grown up with belief that the mountain an Apu-mind guy that will lead his or her feet, and a fundamental different human human different relationship to that front than a little child from Montana, and a little child of Montana, grown to the idea that the mountain a little child of Montana, is to mine.
Or it the lives of a spirit of a member of it, is irrelevant.
And interesting is the metaphor that defines the defines between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were to become a several with become a sever.
That made me a different human beings than my friends of the Kwagiulth, who believe that those bosses the bottom of Kuxwhue and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel of the world round in the north of the world floors of the world floors of the world shape.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-inforce.
And if you start the idea that these cultures can separate different realities can get different realities of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a photograph that I april in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating, is not only the fascinating, is not just the poorer of poor. But how fascinating, but how it is. It's built from two sources.
Enerzed slide there is a wood drawing carboline, harmaline in harmaline in heart and slight hallucinating.
If you take the plant seems to take the blue that a blue smokwalm through your consciousness by your consciousness by your consciousness.
The plant is is mixxes of a coffee becomes a coffee of a coffee fridis.
The plant is powerful tryptamines, naudyline serotonine, dimethyltryltryltryltry-methoxyltrydimethoxyltrydimethy-ptamine,
Have you ever seen the Yanomami as they were that substance of different species that substance of different species that are substance of different kinds of methoxyltryltry?
That powder your nose in bland, is a little bit of a regard, and paintings with barokay, to be on a sea of electricity. This is not a reform of reality; it creates emergency reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultanes, to convince -- a man who did the psychedelic aily in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating, because when the effect are intract intract home, there is no more home to experiencing the hallucination is not to take the hallucination because they are uncle in the human darming because they are emerging their effect of human darmer oxiday.
They can only be oral oral emerging with something that the monoamine of soamine effect.
The fascinating is that the containing carbolines in the gang gaps are to the gun-suppressure to activate the tryptamine.

The Indians say, "The plants talked to us to the plants to us to the data means that data that data this stem of ayahu-foot ayahhhome to identify all of the big distance that they can identify in our eyes as one kind of would be money.
If you bring their questions how they put their taxonomy their taxonomy in the way of plants.
You know that you know anything at all? I said no.
And it turns out that you can see all 17 species in a night in a night in different toird in different towards of sings.
You don't promote at Harvard, but it's a piece of tell.
Now, the problem is that even the ones of us that sympathic opportunity to insimpact in the history of insimmediately and colorful to a footner in the history as the real world, meaning our world, is our world, continued on the real world, is continued our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not reminded to be reminded to be reminded to his wars or his technological innovations, but earlier when the age that we were in it, and active participipes or passive destruction to the massive destruction of biological and cultural and cultural diversity on the planet.
All cultures have always been sharing a dance of new life opportunities.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem of the problem isn't a problem as well.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux is not Sioux and treet up to be as min when they were to be Americans when they were to be Americans when they were their horse and way.
It's not changing or technology that is the integrity of the event bate. It's power.
The wrace of the government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the freezing of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living bats are dealing by identify to identify the ability to their appropriate opportunities.
Or this is going to be the huge amount of deforestation in the home of the Penan, a nomadical seatically follow that to the previous generation in the forest, and the previous generation in the forest, and now reduced to service the river of the river itself to the river itself with the river of Borneo reo -- to the report is the requiet that the river is the resize Sorno Chinance that Jap-Chinese Sar-Chinan-re-reo weathuile regiance of Border to the questith,

In the case, in the Yanomami are the disease that has been inside of the discovery as a result of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excellent of a people, universal revice, but enocide, the destruction of life, not only is a bab, but in many areas don't even becomes not only in many areas as as as as as as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic levels on the basic levels on the basic levels on touching in touch.
I have a young colleague of the land of Coma's land from Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then I understand Lhasa in Lhasa -- I understood behind the statistics where you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroying during the Cultural Revolution.
The father, the father's dad was dedicated to the Panchen Lama.
And on that he was done of the Chinese invasion was started.
As uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which brought the people to Nepal in Nepal --

He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was two -- he was hidge under her rock, because they don't have a crazy.

And one day she stace a day she got to a poorest of Mao. For this overrate from Mao. And before they were seven years to seven years to be removed from a day.
The pain of Tibet can be imperation, but the confreet, but the confreezing of the people, is something to fast your closer to fast your close to be free your chams.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of untance or do we live a color can we live a color of diversity world of diversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that she peace we direction a general image move.
We wouldn't only see the human imagination is to be constrained to a small model, but also we would have to be until and forgets that there are other options.
We can feel in the idea that our kind of idea that our kind of only 150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitic Revolution, who was taking our agriculture in which we had to replace the shaman of the shaman was replaced by the shaman was away from the priests and we got a overshot by specialization by specialization by specializing 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history that we don't give me the idea that we have all the answers to all the question that we have all the question of the next millennia on our path.
If the intelligic cultures of the world to people the meaning of humans are asked to 10,000 different voices to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in the song that we are going to discover again to be discover again, to be what we are going to be a people, which is all in the arms to work all the garden to be flower. There's a larsist moments of optimism.
This photograph I taken the northern of Baffin Island taken up with Inextensive to Inextensive you.
This man, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inexcited. In the 1950s, to produce our sout, to cut our sout, in ndermal setttings.
The opa of Olayuk refused to go to go.
The family family family for his life and denam all his life and dealing him all his his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Interin not afraid for the college were using it.
The giron icrocks of their sleeths were causing fish in candware of caribs.
Olayuks up, not frightened for the polar night or the storm that hunt hold or the storm that hold in the storm that hold in the storm that was running for the polar night or the storm that hate.
He went out out to out, he was living from sea hondent of seases and poep in his hand. Then he started to freeze, he started it as a liming.
He brought a low-ly-to-side-to the side-of heading of the wheeling of the wire of the wheel.
When it was solid was to bring a dog of doggs.
He unfelt the dog and improvised a harnahom.
And then the ribs he made a basket of a bad one.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared, including pooks.
And this is going around with nothing to do about it, in many ways, it is symbol for the resistance of the Inin and all the inside of the world.
In april 19999 gave the Canadian government the Interminer of the U.S. S. and Texas California and Texas sams and Texas Secret Secut.
It's independent. They regard, and they are all the ground.
It's a amazing example of how a nation is enough to her people can by.
And finally, I think it's clearly to think it's clear, at least for who is to get to this high-homestic of the world is that they actually don't get away to go away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are at the beginning of human imagination that go back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, will be the dreams of these kids, are being part of the unbited of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is out of the idea that politicians never reached anything else to go to anything anything else.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic, but we believe that stories can change stories the world, that we probably the best tellers. Our website is 35 million times a month, 35 million times a month, 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on the took of a millient public.
We make a felt to travel to the enosfer to the eat, to our public, to such particular particular particular particular principles, and hopefully to excit so hopefully to be the most important barrels of anthropology is going to be in a variety that we can find a way to be a way to live in a multiculate in a multicultural resize and pluralistic world
where all the wisdom of all the people's editorial to our mind-well-bear.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question stuff that I have been a book of the book of the book of the book of the question that I was going to have a book of questions that I have changed to you about a book of questions,
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some sense of some interactly.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be, the official dogma of all the Westery, interested society, interested society.
And that official dogma, as official dogma, as well-to-of-making our citizens on the highest level, we have to give them so much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential cheat-up part of the human existence.
And the top of the such freedom of us to do to do to do a higher well-behigher well-behind without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choicicy-possibility.
More choices that people have freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wealth.
This is so deep getting into our society that nobody would be on to device.
And in our life is this dogma.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
Next that 175 similar teaching threats are in my supermarket market circle virgin oil and twel-virgin oil and twel-vironment.
And that you can make a task of tallow to make a bunch between 175 species for you, nothing between 175 species for you,
So that's the supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can cut your stereoset -- loud of your stereoset player, cassettesple peler, radio tesple peler, radio task of it.
And in that one electronicastorkle is going to take you from this number of attackle of this desire at this point.
You can do six-half million different systems, with parts of parts of parts of the store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for young long ago, you could ask all kinds of phones and ask Ma Bell.
You hurt it up. You bought it up.
That was the fact that it had never been properly to go.
That time is forever.
Today there are a lot of different across a lot of different across across a lot of different across a lot of different across a lot of different across a lot of different across it.
And in mobile of cell phones is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the high -- with the hundred of player, and crackle brand-break brandom.
And you don't have this model that in the wincle in the wincle, but you can certainly be able to be soon,
The consequenc: people come to the store and assume this question.
And you know how the answer to that question question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of that doesn't do too much does not do too much does.
And in aspects of life that are more important than the power than the power of stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact of choices.
Gealth care, it's in the U.S. inmiddle of the U.S. incentive that you go to the doctor.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A doctor, or we can do But, or we can do Butch a
A has this forward and after it.
BB has this forward and assing what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doc, what do you find out of what does you find it?"
And the doctor says, "A has this forward and Biet has this preventing and nadish.
What do you want to do it?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was like, what would you do you?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy task of decision of decide from someone with resistance -- the doctor -- to a likely and not the best condition to take decision to take decision to take decisions. For on recipatient. And for the patient measure of recipments is getting a lot of recipal resistant to take a lot of recide much more recipment.
And you can get it up to that nerrow up somewhere because the goal's group, you can't buy it.
Why do it as we can't copy?
Because they think we think we are going to take our doctor our doctor, to ask that other brand ask that other brand ask that other brand ask that other market away to take the next morning to the next morning our doctor of our doctor of our doctor of our doctor of the doctor
Our identity, yet a prices of us existence, is now overnature to choices, as you can see on this slide on this slide.
Our identity is that our identity is from our background.
We find ourselves out of ourselves, we just want.
Every morning, you have to think about what person you want to think what person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage of marriage --
There's a time that freezed that freezed everybody out of it would be able to get as fast as fast as quickly, and then as fast as quickly.
The only realm choice was with who, not when and what you did.
Now free everything for the opportunity to the way.
I just give you a particularly intelligent students, which I was double than housings that I was easger.
They are not domer or in the earlier than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Sell I married or now?
Or will I wait? Do I first kids do I first children, or a care?"
These are all suspending questions.
They go through them to an answer, even if this means that they don't get their homework and then and then no good number of them and then a good number of cat.
And they have right. They're important life questions.
And then we get in work. Carl gave just that technology is taking us to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute -- except in the Rolph Ho.
There's one place, by the way, I love secret that I like to love it, where WiFi does it.
I don't think because I don't like to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choice choice of work in that we are increasking us to work on again, or we'll work on again, or not.
We can look at a football of our son's son's bottom of our sone, with us on one hand, and our Blackberry on the other side, and maybe our laptop on the laptop on the other side,
And even if they are all of them all of the things that are we going to get all of that compete with all kinds of questions, "Do I answeren't I answer?
Do I go to this email took this issue of letter? I write this letter writing writing this letter?"
And even if the answer the answer is we experienced the football weighttle of our son in a very different way.
And what we also look at the big, the small materialist things that is liststyle: life is a question of choices.
And this is what the world used to looked like this.
There were some choices, but it wasn't anything was a question of choices.
And this is what the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad or bad work?
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what is good about is that there is good about what is a bad about is a bad to it.
That huge choicy choicity has two effects of humans.
A very opposite effect is that the earlier paralyzed than free is that it works than free became a very consider.
And so many choices people find the harness people find the choice.
I give you a very dramatically, a very dramatically, to investment in volunteer to volunteer planns.
A colleaguard, a colleaguard, to investment data from Vanguard, a big policy policy-foot policy with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
They found that for every decade every decades of policies that took the work-micked the partnature two.
At fiftig farmed farms, it was less employees than five than five than five and less employees for five --
Because it at fiftig is so hard to choice as hard to choice that people just choice to the next day, and that up, and that up, and that on, and so on.
And from the point comes off.
That doesn't just that people after their pentive pentive to eat their pentive because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have been so hard to have a hard part for a lot of people who have a compassion, that they have a companies of desire.
And they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year.
The work-to-double was to double their own contribution to double.
So too much choicity can be paralyzed paralyzed
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it goes to the century to you like to do to the right choice choice mas, right?
You don't want to be regular with the wrong fund, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we have, as well, as we have the lamming of our dissection and choices, finally less fewer than it would be less of the result than it would be if we had fewer options have had less options as we had fewer options as we had fewer optimes.
There are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it can look like the choice was not perfect.
You ask in a case, you asked that a different choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative alternative to you get spike from your choice.
And spike on the front of the choice of choice that you have made it in the choice that you had a good choice choice on the choice of choice.
And the more options are, the more option, it's to have a set of unair from the unair of electricity to be chose option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorrow, in the value of things depending things depending on the things that we are similar.
If you can inst your many alternatives can inst your many alternatives of all alternatives that you deal of all alternatives that you deal with it.
That makes you fewer task with the alternative that you chose have chosen a bridge.
A excuses. For the non-New Yorkers below you -- my excuses.
This is a little bit of the stress of this example.
This is a set on vavolcanction in the Hamptons.
They have a third wound.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend weather. No human beings in vision.
Does can't do it? "Dutilt," thinks that man, "It's augusty.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city out of the city
I could take my car, I could take my car, for the door parkers."
And he's sitting there two weeks to the idea that he was a great parking place every day for a great parking place every day for a great parking place for two weeks.
And substitutional costs are going to cost of our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are, the more connections are to be more attracks.
And that presents are presenting to us as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image store is going to a number of points.
Life in the here and for example, and you don't have to go ahead things like that.
Another point is that you with every choice other choice other choices.
And all that other has so his attractive to the crash of cooses that is less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this for a new blow-up to a new breed.
I turned out to almost of them is always speaking out.
But it was just one kind of stuff -- and you blown it was bought to be incredibly untask, but if you don't want to be incredibly ung enough and felt enough and often enough and often enough and often enough to be enough and felt enough to be enough and felt enough to be it.
And after years I went to the store for a newd.
I said, "Day, I want to do a stuff, this is my meas."
And the winter said, "Would you smart, easy fit, easy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you want to buy or a rit? Would you like a rhy?
Do you want a blowing with the boars effect?
Do you want something that reflects or flink out of pipes, or flut." And so he went on.
I was there at a time of them. And I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea which blowing that was and so I have an hour for hour for hours all the possible of the power to hold up all the possible of it.
In fact, I left is quite honestly, I left the wincle with a bloss blown blows.
I had done better before. And I could do better do it for all of that possibilities I could do better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To do this to myself out of myself, I wrote a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of my itself.
The reason I don't feel better with all of that choice, was that I started expecting to expect from a good speeding of a good speak of a good stuff.
I started without any expectancy, because I was only one kind of speaking one kind of speaking --
Then it turned out there were different wars, and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I was bought was good, but not perfect.
And so I read my board with my blowing with my expectances and that asked me count.
The more abilities people have to have more expectations they cook about the equality of that opportunities of that opportunity.
And that means people are less too, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this not.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about today.
And in the real thing is about it.
Everything was worse better when everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse to people were surprising experiences have been surprising experiences.
In our modern society can we as a profounds, we can expect as perfect, but the best thing we can get to get to be something that we ever reach.
No one we ever get surprise because our expectancy, my expectances are tower.
The secret of happiness -- this is for you all of you have come to -- the secret of happiness is not too much expected.
I want to ask -- I want to do a car, as a car, biographics -- I was a woman who is actually fantastic.
I did not have a less too.
But less enoughs take a good sides.
And finally, when you get a bad bad bull bone as you can buy a bad of breed. You can ask you why you can do a questions why you are intouches you are.
The answer is that case,
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different greenhouse is available to fall, you know, who is responsible?
The answer is just as simple to that is you to do it.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greenhouse to fail.
So if people decided to take people decisions of those decisions are good decide of these decisions about their choice.
And that take them quality to take himself.
In the Western society clearly clinic depression underneath the younger generations of younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the Western society clearly celebration
A factor -- not the enia, but a significant factor in this explosive explosive to this explosive is that people have been so often teleural experiences because of their high expectances of their expectations.
And if they try to explain that teleuration for itself, they give himself the decade itself the decade.
So the nettoresulat is that we go on and get objective to go forward, but our baders,
Another a summarile of a summaril.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be given by everybody to where is taken by where you get away to where you get to get for where you get to get on for where you get away to get everybody for where is being touched by everybody to get on the official dogma,
But it's not.
It doesn't suffers no doubt that can chose better than not can chose better than it doesn't automatically that more choice is more choice is better choice is even better choice is even better.
There's a magic foundly on choical front of choic.
But I know that we for for long before we are for long before we are choicity for for long as well-behavior.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best we can keep the best to be able to keep the best of it.
The choicity in common.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about earlier, where the problem is not so much choice, but right now.
So the paradox that I speak here for the moderne, so that moderne, well, well-well-to-fashion the moderne,
That's frustrate, and I cut up here is that Steve Levitt has told you that expensive and hard to installing kids are not help to be kidny.
I say the same about this paper choices -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they don't help now: they focus again.
They make us lifewer to be less worth less worth.
If part of what people in our society is going to be able to make all of these choices to be transmission, where people have to be able to be living that people on it.
And we can go on on on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improve Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reverction of well-freedom people -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last of choicity that we behavior.
And finally, you read this image story -- you read this image story like a developed of human beings saying, "Oh, what does that know fish fish fish of it?
Nothing is possible in a fish combish."
A scral example, a short global image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I took about it, I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this to the hand: If you get the fishing to create power the fish craft to create opportunities and balance.
If you get the fishing to create potential to create potential to create potential of the power to be less too.
It leads to more distribution and less rate.
Everybody has a fish.
This is free certainly to the fish, but certainly for us to the fish, but certainly for us --
But the absence of a figure-fishing questions to ask miserable, departness is asking for a sack-heil.
Thank you for your attention.
