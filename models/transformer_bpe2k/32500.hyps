Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the pooly capture, which had about the past three million years about the size of the day.
But this particular problem is the nst of this particular problem because it doesn't show the disk.
The ice heap on the North Pole in a sense, in a sense, heart of our global climate system.
It set out in the summer and crimpt in summer and crimpt in summer.
The next slide I show is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent, the permanent ice is purpose.
As you can see, it back to dark blue.
That's the annual ice during the winter.
And the crimp in summer summer
The so-called permanent, five years or older, is almost like blood is almost like blood that is a set here.
In 25 years of this to this forward this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground is frozen Icell around the Northern Icell and there's a very big amount of carbon is a very big amount of carbon is being being in methane, when it was death,
Take the number of disconnecting in the atmosphere, that could be dedub, that could be diverse amount of the atmosphere, if we divided the regular point to the regular point of the atmosphere,
In some representation in Alaska sign relates to all of the water.
And the last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to the mpore.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is to be that we will be that we will be be that will be be there.
A reason for that, is that this huge warm-warm-bron" Greenland from the north warms.
This is a meltwo-at-atur.
The water volume is the waterme greater than evil as it evolved.
This is the Kanger-lussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea so-peads because it landijes, it's the place where it comes into the sea place where it comes into the sea place where it comes in the sea.
These flow down these flow flow.
On the other hand, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last month, reported scientists that has a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice in the West of the South Pole very quickly the selting, with a few underwatering squattered with a few underwaters.
The whole continent state for six feet sea lestying, just like Greenland.
In Himalaya, the two after the largest ice mass ice mass, there are new notice a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of its drinking water from that smell time.
In the Andes, is this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more flow today.
But when they disappears disappears are drinking water.
In California was a reduction of 40 percent in the snow painting from the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions at the time.
This global dreams of drief -- this global stying,
And the number of nature, purpose-pushing speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unately,
If you look at the bottom from a historic context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours --
25 mi-five miles every day in our oceans, look at the eye area of the Stille in the United States of America, and to every side, and every side, and every side, and every size of Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of the oceans.
The only big cause of warming, the only warming warming, is to deforest, which is the burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem, and it's very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more stone.
But we see a circle.
These are the coal-carbon centrales where the building became a number of alternatives were removed in alternatives were forget away and alternatives were readed.
There is a political fightforward to the globe in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industire gave industire for 250 million dollars to promote "screen coal coal coal of coal coal of coal --
And that image was doing something about something like this.
And the urb, there was a home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons carbon model.
You probably seen the news of the news news of news
This is the one after one after one after a biggest waste in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking the cooking the Kersted was this one.
Video: "Frosty the coal of coal is a stine, a crochaded guy.
He's overliquid awful here in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the coal carbon is screen with the day.
He's paid and employees and employees hold their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia froms.
The largest mines of the country is the great boss of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they talk about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate.
This is a piece of a piece of it.
Video "ALergy, COLergy, we see the climate change as a serious threats for our business.
That's why it is the reason the main purpose to give a giant engaging a giant confusions of light and the devoted of the light and the destiny of stroke.
Fiit is, steenchal is not smarriage.
We find that the sonce is -- and it still more more likely to be able to find that it is more more liked.
So, don't make worries about climate change.
And let me just about us.
Video: Schone stenke, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern shan emergency crow-carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon a centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are pretty much a little bit of a lawys.
But that's the sound of a coal coal technology.
And despite the fact that the breaking of stench, one of the main causes of the main causes of the Earth is shaping shone of the global technology that you see here.
Look at the time is the shot carbon technology today.
Al Gore: Einally past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative security.
Video: Stem: America is the crisis, the national security economy, the national security is the climate crisis.
The red wire whether is our dependence of fossil fuels, as dirty coal fuels and impact.
But now there's a during new solution to get out of this.
To of 100 percent of a 100 percent of a hundred of a year.
A plan to get a plan to get a fellow to the safea safea safetle, and the global warming.
Finally, a solution that requires resolve enough to solve our problems.

Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African is saying, "If you want to be all of it.

We need to go far far, and fast;
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back to an updated up with an updated about how it works.
So here I am a little bit of the ones who were not waren't waren't the largest scientific experiment ever underneneath in engaged in engaged in engaged in engaged in the engineer in engaged.
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked less than a billions of second after the universe started to be 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, d!
This is the machine under Geneva.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one I work. It's called the ASDA, detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in dia
Spectaneacular picture of ATLAS in the way that you can see the scale.
At 10 years we put it in 10 years, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that causes a partor in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle particle straight that all around the way around LHC, and with a set up of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which is which in particles in the detector in the detector.
In other words, when we saw it on the 10 September 10 September we knew that was working on a huge away in the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this was the largest acucess, or this is what was going to Google and saw that the Internet page out of the internet page out of the so.
That means we made a cultural as a scientific impact a scientific impact --
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden drams.
And the behaviors 13 thousand a thousand worked at the entire power working on full force.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small dramble.
They can do that because they are superago, because they can be superago.
So on min 271, colder than the space between the stars, that can be powered to behavior.
In one of the connections between the nine of magnets in LHC, was a constructive constructive to a constructive of the neine of a constructive of the nine of the neine of a constructive of the nine of the neine of a constructivate a constructivous.
And it was a wire wheels -- and it was an electrical resistant resistant resistance against that 13 thousand catching 13 thousand you had an electrical resistant resistant resistance against that 13 thousand amping it was a wire of it.
This was the result.
This is another present as you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of the magnets were moving over 20 tons and about 30 centimeter were moving about 30 centimeter were moving to move over a little bit more than 20 tons of the magnets were moving over 20 tons of the magnets were moving over 20 tons of the tons of 20 tons of them --
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did.
We all have disconnected them in the way.
Now, they are back to the one.
Eind murban will be against again.
We will set it back and we expect measure to measure it in junk or right so we can move further with the universe.
Now, of course, have reincidently, who are reincidents the value of scientific research research investigate to re-contracting research in the value of the debate.
I think the fact that it's so difficult that we move beyond than it beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words of English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had been able to decadeed with the value of value experiments of his students, his students, his students, his students, his students said, "None is something so dangerous for the progress of human mind to progress of human mind to progres-of science than the human mind that there are no new new world's recently in the winning of the regular world."
Thank you very much.
I would want to start asking you back to your children at your children at your children at your children play.
When you discovered how to grab it up and conscious up, they were a little problem to solve it with the teaching and hanging through the engineering and hanging from space relations.
Ruimtely insight is powerful because with understanding the world around us.
If a information inspired by the physical interact of physical interaction with objects -- with my advise Pattion and my compassion Pattion and my compasking Jeed. What if we could use a computer would be used to ask -- what if we would use a computer -- what if we would use a computer on the finger as a kind of digital vinger supply that moves on a plate desing of desing with the same hands of information that we can depenpensive information with with the same same same same way with the same way,
and ordering as we want?
And this question ask us so that we decided to find an answer to the Sifttables.
Cort cookilled a Siftable computer size a computer size of a cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cow-cows.
They can be movement, they can move each other, they can feel their movement, and they contain a screen and they contain a screen and wireless.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands of blocks as blocks can they get into blocks to grab it by grab.
And the most of the Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information of digital information.
And this aid tools have a more physical ship, have a more physical ship, and even of the way we moved them from each other, and even of the way we move them to move different new and neaded interactions of the way we move them from the way we move them from the way we movement,
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is a video to tell a video that plays and others playing a video play and otherset and othersheel-played crowd,
These interactive portraits of consciousness.
Indians next to each other, they will be put together, they will interest in the world.
If they get surround, they can also this and get some nervous weak and become a little nervous weain
And they feel movement, they movement.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all, as it excited, as it excitement of a color as it was a liquisital as it was a liquished as it was a fluid of the things that was a liquid content.
In this example of three Sifttables are about it, and I can use them to go color in a living, where they are mixed in a embrine.
If we have threat we have focused on the back.
There are some of the case possibilities for education, mathematical gine and logics that we want to give people the possibility and logics that we want to give things rapidly things rapidly to see the result immediately,
So here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci recently by a simple computing.
Here we show a game that is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single around a random letter on every Sifttable, and shake words are controlled in a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds it's very rescue, and applies a new series of letters with contributing possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I succeeded them out and make a video of them and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost not need instructions.
Everything you have to say, "Move word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people test it.
That's our youngest ber right at the time, right.
And it turns out he just wouldness,
For him these were just blocks.
Here is a interactive painting paintings.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language of language
This is Felix that demos defense.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just shed the Siftare with that character of the table.
Here he leaves the Sun.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now, he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good done! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the needle to put places the needge of a carakters with each other, and the needle -- Video: Wdemand!
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decides to decide how it rate.
Video: The catches away.
DM: The last example I will show you today is a synthesizer and live music and live music in which we developed with a sound producing sound as the lead, bass and pressure and pressure and pressure and pressure and present drum.
Eengiven different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the argue of the sounds can determined the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the approach, in a very very likely in a very lifetly of available effects like reverb and filter.
They are being sound to a sound and adapted by office.
And if you can see the general effects like tempo and volume that are admitted by the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern the entire pattern adaped by the entire pattern effects like tempo and volume on the entire pattern effects like tempo and volu
Let's look at that.
Video: DM: We start a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern by a first pattern by a lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now, I add a little bit of slaging.
Video: DM: And now I copy the filter on the drums, so I can affect live the effect live in the effect live in the effect live in the effect live in the effect of the impact.
Video: Designess I can accelerating it by the office blocks.
Video: DM: Now, I copy the filter of the bas for a little more expression.
Video: Design, I can reach the pattern as it plays it plays it plays the pattern as it plays it plays --
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything I can improvise and shorter as I want.
With the dimessage the dimessage of the volume Siftable to the left.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is going to make new people from the making new human-computer interfaces that are better destroying the brain and bodied the way our brains and bodied body.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design region with some of the opportunities that we develop in the lab.
The thought, I want to bring about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation with digital media, which brings the information with digital media, which bringing the information to our world as we want.
I thank you from a heard.
I look at it to talk to you with all of you to talk to you with all of you.
I'm writing.
Books of my work, but also a lot more than that.
My whole life long I've been doing writing writing writing writing that will change anyone that will change.
And yet there is a property in my life and career in my life and career on my job, and I had to see my relationship with my job and re-re-in-straight in my job.
And the began with a book I wrote recently written a memoire: "E, Biddying, which is very very contradiction, which is very very contrast and an international existseller.
And the consequence is that people now have to go and pulled me and always teged me as if I do do I do it.
To do what -- gets doing!
People come to me and ask me and ask ask you that success, you don't afraid you can never be able to equip?
As you don't afraid you will keep write your whole life but never a book such a book such a book of the people are going to write for warm.
Don't you imag?"
For retly, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- but I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was a teenager, I was a teenager,
People said, "Don't you afraid you never have succes?
Don't you think about it -- that you will go on it up?
Don't you imagine your life on this work is going to be a little bit of you are in the fact that there are a little bit of your broken bitter as of your broken bitter ax-a-a-falset of fail?"
Something in that streting.
In the short, my answer to that questions on this questions on this is "Ja."
Yes, I am afraid for all of these things that are called "Scee of the things that are called
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things afraid you don't know what it does.
For sea whose for example, and other engineering things.
But what I write writing myself the last time is the last time when that fear comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that someone is eight to be frightened to be working for their opinion on Earth for their ment?
What is so particular about creative processes that we make sure the effects of the minesses of minesged in the mindnesses of work, which is not happening to be able to do not happen.
Take my father. He was separated engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he worked on someone has asked someone has asked someone in the 40 years to him if he didn't have any afraid to him it was not afraid somebody has been asked on someone in the 40
And so of thing, "John, how did it with your chemistry?"
No, as it didn't get about it.
To be fairly in order to be aware engineers by the centuries have no reputation of manic, to be a manic-depressive alcohosts to be almost of the coholide.
Provers well, who have a reputation.
Not just writing, other creative people have been able to be the reputation mentation mentation mentation is pretty instable.
And just look at the grimming death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many died you, many times often by own stidentify
And even those who don't have a suicide pleasure suicide, under their gave to be consult to be their suicians.
In the last interview for his death said, "With every one of my books is a piece of my books is a little bit of minitself."
That's a little bit about your life-work.
But of this kind of a quickly we don't look up.
We all heard it all before, and have heard it with set of the speak of accepted.
The so-thought, is that creativity is unlow-connected connected to suffering and that a ended stone is going to reduce a artist-existence,
So why do I want to ask everyone here today I want to live this idea notion of liv?
Do you have that OK?
Because I'm a good thing about it, I think it's not a very much about it, I don't think it's a very high thought.
I think it was the weather.
And even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century, this century, I wouldn't be this century,
We can creative mind a lot better approach.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to that dark dark in the dark of mind.
See the phase of my career is in which my career now.
Go too, I am a high, amper teach.
I can do maybe four decades work on a decades.
Hemestians, probably everything I now published now as the work that followed as the work that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can tell you a little bit of the biggest success is my biggest success already already behind me.
Yous, what a idea!
If you think about this is a little bit of you for the morning, you know, at the morning,
So I don't want to do that.
I love love with the work I love work, I love a while I love loved.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just go through writing a psychological protection in the process inside the process.
I have to create the writing a safe distance of the safe and my conversation very understanding angst for the responses to my future public.
I went to ways to do that.
I am in history, and I do do a little bit and deeps in other civilizations to see or others in a better way to help creative people to help creative process.
My quest me a quickly research and Romend.
And so, because it's a long time, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the old Gree-old Greeks and Rombs and Rombs people didn't believed that creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity was a god-considered spirit -- unknown place to humans to the human beings and unknown reasons.
The Greeks called the Greeks called the creativity "demonen."
Socrates believed he had a demon that he had a demon that words him words of refluistered him that he words him words to refrigered.
The Romomestic had a kind of same idea.
And in them was a genius was a genious creative minds."
The funny is that the Romomain with a genius is not a pient.
In their policy was a genius a kind of magical god-entitit entitled in the walls of the ateltion of the ateltion of the ateltion of the ateltion of arty.
A little bit like Dobby the house eless.
If the artistic was working at work was the genius assistence.
And he gave a seen shape, he gave shape.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the earlier about the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how to be able to do that in his work
The artistic was so in protection to be a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work and you didn't get all the honor for that.
Everybody knew that was that an invisible genius you had helped up.
Do you get a crowd, then that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independent genia.
Lge time is that the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed --
There is a very new idea: the individual human idea: the high point of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, in the godle-sent world.
That was the beginning of rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual case.
And for the first time in history was there about artists in history was a genius and not that they had a genius and that they had a genius and they had a genius
I have to say, I have to say that a big froke.
To person, one answer single individual individual is the vehicle of century, the source of the century, the source of everything that didness, creative and known before -- that's a lot of responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
As if you ask someone asks the sun in swhether you know.
Egos are re-blown proportions, and there are increasingly expectations to prestently re-expectations to prestations in a couple of reduced.
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years aheaapot of artists purpose.
If that is, and I think, and I think, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the relationship and the creative mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can make rational well, we can rational we'll be able to make rational wouldn't make a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes in a front of the wrong of the wrong manisn't a rational home.
Probably in the audience people who have remember the scientific doubly doubt about the idea that elfollowing up with some feet turing the work of artists to inspiring high-like worth of the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to be that I won't get you in that.
And I ask it question to me.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that thought, "Fine?
The fast as much as much as much as the other explanations of totally calculated unknown, uncalculate the incalculate process.
Everybody who have a little bit of creating to create -- so in fact, all of the conversation is -- it doesn't always rational process itself rational process is not always rational required.
And that sometimes it feeling a paranorms.
I have recently the great American denran ansoever.
She is a thick in the nine-describes all the poems.
She told me about her childhood on the country, from Virginia.
Somes, when she was on the field to the work, she was felt to the country.
And it was so so said, "Well, as if there was a big wave air way.
And so a little golfed golfing over the country to her across the country to her across the country to her
She felt that the ground under her feet started shake and her at that point, and she knew that is just to do one thing for her life.
She ran home, back to home, and she had to get as quickly as quickly as possible, and paper and paper paper and paper to get out of paper and then paper to get as quickly as quickly by the paper and then paper to get it as quickly possible.
When the poem was that poems, her only came up with her hate waves her only opportunity to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then and then they ran and ran and ran is not reaching the house.
And at these moments the poem of having her hich, disappeared by her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another denser animal -- in her words -- in a different denser -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different density -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words
And then we have been a little bit -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were close the poem -- they almost miste.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper, and paper and the paper and paper the paper of it.
Jue at that potased to take a potleash.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she pluked the poems.
She paked the close to his tail and it back into her body, and it back into her body, while she was wrote it back into her body,
In that cases came up with the poem of what is in a little bit of paper, but then I think of the paper was reversed in the paper of paper in that cases in the sense,
When I heard that -- I thought -- what is accidently, my creative processo!
This is what my creative process! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouse of a mulrary, who's the same time when it distiping and trans through blood and trans it room.
But even in that daily swring that daily had a experience.
And you'll also know it itself that feeling that creative ideas in your record, you know, in a source that you can identify impossible identify is impossible identify impossible identify to identify it itself.
So what is that for source?
How can we use it without a crazy that we get it without a crazy to use it without a crazy of the way we get it without a crazy to use it without a number of become the without that we get it without that we get it without a crazy?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
a few years ago I interviewed him for a while.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is a big part of his life the shows of the crazy artistic artistic artistic artistic creative impulse on the unconfusable creative impulse in him.
With the ''s, Tom a little bit more quickly refrer.
And one day he reached in Los Angeles over the freeway the faith, and changed the process of radical
And as he already wrong there, he heard a clip,
The decision, as inspiration that does is a crowl, ingrab, crowlling it.
It was a nice melody and he wanted to hit and he wanted to hit the vasthores.
But it didn't go up.
He had no paper, no paper, no paen, no taneous.
The well-known excited, and then the melodized with the melodie, and then it stays and then it remains in the century backwards.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get a little bit of panic, but he stopped that whole mental, and he did something news.
He looked at the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, can you not see I behind the sense I sat up the sense of the sky.
"Do you think I can write a songle of song?
If you really want this song, you have to be adapted to you even adaptor when I have a time for you.
And not, then someone else lots of fall.
Go neighborh." And then the time when it was los." And then the process of reporate the process of very different things.
The work is the same thing to the supposed to the dark itself,
But the heavy that creative process in the creative process in the genius when he disappeared from genius.
The genius was close to the skin and supposed to the skin,
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre cooperation between Tom and the property of Tom and the ownership of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of works.
I had already profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ext, Biddomins.
And at a little bit of point in despad.
You know that it is a terrible to be good affected and you think it's a terrible disappoint. The book is the book of it.
Not just just a lot of things really horrible work.
I wanted to do the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember, and I decided to be able to way.
I wended from my manuscrips, and I focused crips, and a very fun of the room.
And I said, "Listen throwd, we know all of that if this book is not just because it's not just because it's not just because it's not just by me.
You can see that I have in the way I have in my mind.
I can't give you a lot of that.
If you find that it better opportunity to your thing.
Ret? Do you don't do that, yourself.

Eairctive away in the North African desert people together to dance in month, to thank the sacred music.
Ors and hours and hours to the morning gglors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, a very bunch of it extraordinary exceptions.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you've ever seen a little bit of a performance in a performer.
It was like the time still, and the dance and the dance of a purchase.
He did nothing else than the thousands of night as it catches together but now focused all together.
And suddenly he didn't seem just a human beings a human beings a human beings
In him, under him of him -- above him.
A goddly well.
If something happened to be something called the Dan people had started to clah, they started clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was for them.
And by the way, a fun historic fact, when Moren Moren Spain Spain Spain Spain Spain this case with me.
The outcome is the outcome is by the century of the centuries of "Allah" in "Allah" in "Olly."
That hear you hear the day still fighting and flaments and flaments and flaments.
If an artists in Spain something impossible, or magic, "Allah, oil, oil ellah, great, oil Allah, violate Allah, great, broak."
Actually, a glimpse of God.
And recipe we need to have a recipals.
Lasty is the dance of the dancer the dance of the morning, he discovered on dinner 11 a.'" not didn’t recognize a god-a-mind laddder,
And at that point is a little bit more parently, with region that may never be able to such more to such high.
Maybe there will be someone more of God will never attacks.
What should he now is to be with the rest of his life?
That's a difficult.
That's really difficult to selecroll for a creative mind.
But as painful highly don't have to be too to be too
Imagine that you don't go from explaining aspects of your person aspects of your person from you.
Imagine that you believe them a while, you know, a while,
When you are, they are ready by someone else.
And so, it is a single consider.
I have this thought of the average that thought day.
The last months I've been working on a book, that will short short. The book where a lot of a lot of a lot to reach a lot of recently reach.
The soluger of illustring illustric.
If my mind thoughts with me on the hall, I love the same one: Don't get the same thing, don't get to.
Do just work you work.
For just do you do then, whatever it is.
If it is too dancing, thank you very much.
If the god-head genius that you have been decided to make in your work at some pointances in the wonderful source of amazing source in the Oly!"
As it doesn't have that thank you just thank you through that.
And then "Oly!"
I believe that of heard.
"Oh, yeah, because we have a pure of pure human love and property and propertly, by pluma and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olly!
You know, I had it already about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what it can mean to mean and what it means and discover sets of genome.
And we actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the digital issue to the digital code to a new bottom to a new bottom in the biology and synthetishing and synthesize the designs and synthesize the designs and synthesize the engineering and now we were trying to figure out to get from
So we always have a tried to ask the big questions.
"What is living a lot of biologists have tried to understand the way to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels.
We tried different approaches in a little bit of the minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to digitize it now running it right now.
When we have sequenced the human genome of genome of the analog world from the digital world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask for us to regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can conceive itself in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at whether we can get a nature smaller genome can be able to get a nature of a nature of genome
We can get in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolc map, is that relatively simple compared to the use.
To me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch a switch, it's very unlikely that this could be a living cell.
And we decided that the only route pre-condition, to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions. And so we could could deal ask the components to be able to ask the one of the most fundamental questions.
And so his ask questions like "Can we started a chromosome synthes?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, as we do that, if we can a chromosome "restart?"
A chromosome is just a chemically, but a piece of chemically, a chemically,
So, our tempo of digitize the digitizing of life is accelerating --
Our power to write the genetic code rather slosed slowly, but is access,
And our last point it would put on a exponential curve.
We're talking about 15 years ago.
There were a number of stages for neethic across the first experiments.
But it turns out the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult of DNA is very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very difficult to be the synthesis of the syn
There are a degeneral of thousands of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make the more faler you make the piece of them are more faler.
So we had to make a new method to do for the conceived these little pieces and correct the correct of all the errors of all the mistakes.
And this was our first poging, beginning with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria death that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces did the foutcome ...
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the time we stop a piece of chemical chemical stust in the bacteria and the bacteria genetic code, and viral particles and virtually made a genetic particles and virtually made a little bit of the engineering part of the bacteria --
The viral particles were resequence when I losed the cells, they came back and deaths the E.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they do that model is just fastly well.
They laught more than you.
So we think this is a situation where the software is built the software is building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger.
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial chromosome
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in viruses, so we could could actually various --
to understand what the deeply components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than to be a digital information in computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than it has to be very accuraft.
When we first assumpt this genome in 1995, the default was the default for one both per 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing. If we had the original sequence. If we had the original sequence.
And the design of the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters that are 50 letters to be confront with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-units of building that we need to design so they can get together together to make together a
We design here unique parts in the world.
Maybe you know, we put watermarks in the watermarks.
And I think about this is a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of that letters code for roughly 20 aminoximately -- that there's a single inoxyoxyoxygen for every aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words, singing, though.
And in the point we just "Mo.
Some people were defined that there were no poems.
We have this pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes they repainting and put together together in the world.
And we started making pieces of the stuff that were five to 7,000 letters long, only only seeing a long time, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters, take it from 24,000 letter, take it to 72,000.
In every stage dium we got a following of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process that is very ropust is very robust -- that will you see streets -- that will you see stream.
We try to get the point of automatishing.
So this looks like a basketball final.
And as soon as we come to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 basepars -- they don't grow as easy more in E.
That is the very very expanding of the modern tools of modern tools of molecular biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-o-o-emolo-em-using the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA can feet.
Here's an example of that.
There is a organism called Deinococcus radiodurants that three million radiodurants three million radiodurances of radiodurants three million radiodurancus radiodurants three million radiodurants of radiodurants of the organism called Deinoccus of radiodurans that are a very different from radiod
And that you see in the top panel, sophisticated and shemer sophisticated out of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later he put it again each other,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drought up.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can find itself move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to show that there's a lot of this is outside.
Here's a deeply microph of the molecule that we've made with this processes -- in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, with just yesterday.
And it is that she automatically addressed together.
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we recently recently recently
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would present it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then 142 pages to the genetic code to the genetic code down.
Now, how do we started a chromosome chromosome of the chromosome of it?
And a virus is the clearly pretty easy.
And a lot of bacteria lot of complicated.
It's also simer if you give you a sense of eukaryots, like us, you just wheels the cells and do another in, and that's what you know when it closes.
In the bacteria species of chromosome of the cell, but we have seen a full transpllance of a chromosome transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another other, and it can do a different and activate the other one.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a micro-side.
These are about as far from each other.
We added some extra little bit of extra chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the cromosome of the cromosome of the extra chromosome of the extra chromosome of the extra chromosome of the extra chromosome of extra little bit of extra chromosome of extra chromosome extra little bit of extra chromosome extra little bit of extra little bit of extra little bit of the extra to gency.
We have it with enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you'll be the very advanced graph images here -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to set out of the she'd try to develop the process of what it move further.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of third chromosome from one time in one time that they thousands of ownerships in one time to the species.
People who are proposed evolution as if there is one that has not been a lot of biology has been a lot of biology
There are enzymes that restrict enzymes are called DNA enzymes that actually providing DNA.
The chromosome that was not a cell of cell.
The cell -- the chromosome we stop it -- well.
It was express, and it recognized the other chromosome as strange material, and then we finally had the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromo
He was blue because he was blue the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time the cell of the characteristics of one species, and he changed completely in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein the membranes changed the genetic code -- it was it in which it was changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a power as genomic alchemistry, but we are in fact, by changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changed things fundamentally
Well, I paid earlier for a creation of a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is front signs at 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid an new version of Cambric explosion of Cambric explosion where there are making new kinds of medical new species of measuring new kinds of measure.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty much as you look at what is it need;
We're going to go insquore six-and-a-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each one of us who lived in 1946; within 46, in 46, in 46.
We have distincluding clean water, with the heavy water, medicine, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collions, more than 30 billion ves;
That's 100 miloons of freezing a day.
When we take biological processes in the ogency process than anything to replace that is going to be a huge challenge.
And of course, of course, all the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is in the atmosphere is going to be able to get in the atmosphere is a little bit of the carbon dioxide of the supposed to the atmosphere is a little bit of the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is terrible.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design, and I would like to see as the designer for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out there from that.
We are precisely constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques thanks to do something called synthesemethods to be so-called combination genomics.
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the processes of 20 million different genes, or trying to optimize processes to optimize octask or medicine, or a medicine, new vaccines, we can change with a little team we can change with a little team than in the last 20 years,
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select for lives-vaccine, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, etc, etc, and so on.
This is a screen main-screen design, so that we work on, so you can actually go on the high and a new kind of on computer in the computer can design.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth generation of fuels.
Remember onethanol to ethanol of an environment.
We have second and third generation fuels that will come out from sugar, as sugar, until more fuels like sugar, or more fuels like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price is higher and the available as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as his food supposed and so we are the first food and we think we do the first fourth of the way, and we think we do the first fourth of the first fixxxiety of 18 months in about 18 months.
Sonlight and CO2 is one method -- -- but by our global discoveries -- we have all kinds of other methods.
This is a organism that we have describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, about 2.5 miles in cook head.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy sourcing as energy sources.
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 2 -- which is easy through pipes in factory fabrings, where that is is re-send CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time we think we are able to break out of the basal question, "What is life?"
We have realized -- you know, the petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where then what?
A major energy source become a very important source of energy source.
But we also work on this tools to think about quickly servaccines of vaccines.
This year, there was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the teaches of tephased vaccine.
So here you see how the future can see what the future is going to change the evolutionbottom is going to change with synthetic bacteria, archay, archaeukaryota.
We are still away from the improving humans.
Our goal is survive that we make a chance to survive long, to be a long enough to do that probably a long time.
What I want to show you as a first quickly to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we were to remember about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surrounded in which you locally or on the distance of visual data can be working data.
We look at a lot of gigabytes to digital images and can stay in the well-up with digital images and excellent the sorts of gigaring and the sorts to our wish to our wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the big, how big these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan from the Library Congress, and is in the 300 megapireached in the 300 megapixel
It doesn't matter anything out because it would be only what the prestations is going to affect a girls on a galaxels on a screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of the non-imagineering data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Each column.
To prove that it's really textile is really not a image, we can do something to do something to do something to be really doing, to show you that this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a strange of strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a strange way to read a straight way to read a strange way to read
I wouldn't adapting.
This is a realistic example of this is a outgave from The Guardian.
Each big image is the beginning of a subject of a subject.
This is really a fun, and the experience of a real papers of papers in a real papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium --
We also have done something with the angle of this outcome of the Guardian.
We have a nice made of high resolution -- much more than a normal advertising -- and we have extra little extra information -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limited-screen through the screen.
We hope this is not pop-ups more pop-ups and other supposed -- not even need more than it to be more than it intentially invitable.
Of course, a narrow cards a for the way to this field is a technology like this, I'm not going to spend here to spend up here to this five is that we can also talk to this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top of the NASA.
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who connects two techniques together two techniques together a connection of a project called Photosynth,
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very nice computer vision research by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. It's a beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, we can see this images we experienced by the images and the multi-resolution.
The space dishech of the images has this meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images together these images together with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genome. It's the elements of stabilized diashospity-graphs and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is another environment.
There are more space that are more space today.
I want to like one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this summer in my head, which I have in my head, is the realization of this technique is the realm of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to reach the lawyers, and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look for images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the circle,
And each of these orange chains a image that report of this model turned again.
So these are all Flickr images, which are copied in this way of spatial considered in this way.
And we can do in simple way.
You know, I never thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft --
It's overwhelming here is so devoted to be so demods.
I believe you can see that these many types of cameras are cameras -- all of glexcameras, a big number of it, together a big number of it, conducting in this environment.
And I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so much more covered by faces and so much of the faces and so much of them.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photographs -- here they are.
This is even a poster of Notre Notre Dame that is choiced by the program.
If we dive through the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of the entire collective memory looks like to each other.
All of these photograph are conducted with each other, and shapes a very little bit bigger than the short of the parts.
And you've got a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth
So this as a follow-on Stephen Lawler's works.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it uses it used to grow the preparts grow for the people who use it.
Their own pictures are provide to metap-data that somebody else invoted somebody else else.
If someone would like someone would want to climb and their names and their names and their names is removing the Notre Dame is requires with all of the data, and I can use as a access to the space, which I can use metape versus a kind of cross-model, and creating a kind of cross-model, and created social experience.
And of course, is the six-product of this immense rich virtual model of any interesting place on Earth, which is not just from air photos, satellite images and other applications, but also from the collective images and other applored from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes you possibly square possible in the next years, in the next years, all the images that can be dealed by everyone on the world together by everyone on the world together in the world together?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered.
It creats create, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the images.
And that is being emerged exciting when you think about the richching of semantic information which much of these images are available to do about this images available to do that.
When you look at the web for images, you move a search and the text on the web, and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagination.
What if now, this is that copied images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount rich, which is riching rich, it's a classic network effect. It's a classically network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible.
One of the intense pleasure and eth-research is the possibility to live between those who are not forget to live in the old lives, which are not forget to feel in the wind, which is the ancial in the wind, the profished stockitches in the wind, provide as a bitter-bitters.
The science that Jaguar-smans still traveling the Milky Way, or that the mythes of Inexcise with meaning meaning the mythes of the Himalaya booddhist still is still to the break of Dma, you remember the antropolog: the world that we live in an absolutely of anthropology -- the world that we lives in an absolutely of the endomin's reality, the world of the reality,
the consequence of a fuck set adaptation choices that made our ancestors ago.
Of course, we all parts the same departs of the same dest: Words were born.
We all make all insophistics.
To go through the intangible disconnected by death.
So it can't be surprise that we all singing, dancing and art.
But interesting is the unic catch adans of songs and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodom, or the U.C.A, or the U.K.D, or the Caisut-de-west in North Kenya, the Curch Back of the Curch building or the Caravanai in the Sahara. This is the man of the Sahara. This is the desert of the Sahara. This is the mair, or a maago.
Everest, the goddin-mothern of the world.
They all teach us that we can think of us that we can think of us can think about orienced to orient.
If you think about it, this idea of idea you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen shapes the intelligenous cultural and cultural life that reverse the planet and cultural life that reverse is as important as the biological livweb: the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine as you can imagine as a etnos;
The equipate of the dinner you can define as the totally of all though, myths, myths, ideas, ideas, ideas, inspirations and intuitions that are consciousness.
The etnosed of humanity.
She is the symbol of all that we can be and as amazing curious animals,
like the biosphere is switched to be touched that eats enosed -- and still in a lot of larger mate.
No biologist would be focused to be in the point of all kinds of the species on the point of all kinds of the species on the point of being being totally not true.
And that the most optic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of the loss of this is a loss of this is the loss of this is the loss.
When everybody was born born to this is born six-thousand languages.
A language is more than her gramatic or her grammatical rules.
A language is a front of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that the single of every unique culture the material world that is reachieved.
Each language is a century mind, a disease, a creation, a mind, an ecosystem to spiritual condition.
And from that six-thousand becomes a day is a little bit of that is not fluid in children's fluid in children's fluid in children's fluid
They are not a babies longer adapting.
Effective that, unless a change -- unless a change that they are dead.
Is there something more sense than held to be helped by silent the last of your people, you know, the last of your language, no opportunity of the ancestors by giving the wisdom to see or the regular of the children have to see the kids of the kids must tege?
And reciipe of the fate of the device every two weeks to it every two weeks to it every two weeks in the last letter and with him dying an old language.
Some of you say, "Super, wouldn't be better place to be a better place as we all the same language would we all have the same language of the same language to take Yoruba -- let's take Yoruba
Or Kogi.'" You'll realize what it could be be not spreading your own language.
So what I want to do is to take you on a short journey by the etnos; which has to be a image of a scree of what in fact,
Many of us forgo, when I have it about a different way of being in a different way of being in a different way-way of doing a lot of ways.

"See? It's like I said you have said.
That's how it is it to protect this too protection." They call itself the older brothers.
According to them are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destroy of the world.
And at this point is very important.
If we think about inhead, and we often Rousands and landscape and the old factory of the easy wildlife a racistic in his simplicity in his simplicity.
Or we get half, and say that these peoples at the potate.
Inheem-seemse people's nor is expected by nostalgic novel of nostalgic --
For both of these is a little space in the malaria modes of the Asmat or the irocket winds of Tibet. Desalne-tmin the Alline traditional mystic of the Earth is not in the idea of Earth is based on a lot of subtactemporary is basically subtemplate but in a much subtlease that the idea of the Earth is basically the idea of the Earth, because of the life-cost of a conductive concash of the livate of a moded.
What does that? It means that a little child from the Andes of the Andes that is a stroy of belief that the mountain a sense of her mind and a fundamental other, and a different relationship of the ground that will have been a little child from Montana, a little kid from Montana, with the idea that the mountain a stroy stroy stroy of mine.
Or it the living of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
And interesting is the metaphor, which is the relationships between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forest of British Columbia Columbia with the idea that these forests were crasses to become a crows.
And that made me a different people than my friends of the Kwagiul-friends that believe the bottoms of Kuxywhue and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel of the North of the world swheds.
These minds are important during their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can be able to get different realities of realities can be understanding to a number of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant.
It's a picture I april that I april in the North weast-Amaze.
This is ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahuascinating with this phasn't just the pharmacological potential of it, but how it was it built it is. It's built by two sources.
And so, in a wood-carbon that beta-carbon and harmaline in hears and hears light and hears light hallucinating light.
If you take the plant take a blue of blue room through your inintitivate room.
The plant is being mixed with leaves from a coffee beat, Psychotria running ridis.
The plant wears powerful tryptamines, naucment, destroy ptamine, the death ptamine, 5-methoxyltry-ptamine, 5-methoxyltryltry-ptamine,
Have you ever see the Yanomami as they were that snuclear of different kinds of species that are substancydimethyltrydimethyline of methoxyltry-ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptine.
That pooder your nose nose in bland, is a little bit against against a sea of electricity -- to the countries are on a sea of electricity. This is not a reform of reality; it creates from reality of reality.
I was trying to convince my professor, Richard Evan Shultane-man who did the psychedelic ad-sychedelic avernessor,
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating because when the effect is intricity to the home, no one more home, there to the hallue of the hallue of the hallue of the effect in the human domestic because they are under the same thing that they mean enzymber, monoxiday.
They can only only be oral including something that the monoamine of soamine of soamine of suspended animals.
The fascinating is that the containing carbon bolines in the gaps of the gaps are to activate the tryptamine ptamine, how can this follow in a flora of 80,000 plants of following in a flora of 80,000 plants species that are of the entire kind of two morphological variant species that is a rather than the shaping of the beautiful species that is larger than the shapace of the sing?
We say eufemistic "trial and recrord, which is as a meaningle-covered meant is demask.
The Indians say, "The plants talk to us. The plants talked to us. What does the stem means that that the Cofan, knowing 17 variants of ayahu-distance of ayahu-distance of the eyes would be a kind of money.
If you take their questions of mapping their taxonomy in the mapping of plants -- they say, "I thought you know?
You know, I said, "Ne." I said, "Ne."
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night in a night in a full of different towards in different towards of towards in a night of a night in a night of the taneous.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of tells than meel-to-birth countl.
Now, the problem is that even the problem is that even the sympathic conversions are seemed to be insaccesious and colorful to a foot in the history as a curious and colorful world, it means the real world, meaning our world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember 300 years to be remember of technological innovations, but rather if the age that we were in it, and accountable, or passed participipating or passive destruction to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity and cultural diversity on planet.
All cultures always have a dance of new life opportunity.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem of the problem isn't a problem in the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux as they were their pile, and they were pile, as min as that Americans stopped as that Americans stop Americans when they stop their purposed.
It's not a technology or technology that integrity of the equivalent to the integrity of the eat.
The wrace of government.
And what you also look at the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappearing these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living following existence, which is identify by identify forces that advances are propulling opportunities.
Or this is now about the huge of deforestation in the home land of the Penan, a nomadic nomadical sequence that until and with the previous generation in the forest and reduced the previous and prostitution to the rivers, where you can see that the rivers the river itself with the river, where you can see that the river of Borth of Bore Sulab, where you can see the South of the Japanese, where you can see is the truth,
to fillness their ships with tree tribes from the forest of forest from the forest straight.
In the case of the Yanomami are the diseaseases that are involved as a result of discovery of discovery of discovery.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research in the wrace face of political government.
Genocide, the physical excellent of a people, universal is revice, but it's destroy destroy of a people, is not just convul, but in many areas is not just convic, but in many areas even fishing a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level of the basic level of the basic level,
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles over the country from Chengdu in West China to Lhasa.
And then I started in Lhasa came in Lhasa statistics where you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroying the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And in fact, he was he killed directly killed when Chinese invasion of that Chinese invasy.
His uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people to Nepal in Nepal Consider to Nepal
His mother became a rather became rather because she was riching rich.
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was two -- he was hidden under her rock, because they don't have a cro, because they don't have a crowd in the prison
The sister who stops so heldhaftk in a couple of the case skamp in a couple of the case skamp in a couple of the couple of the smoket of smoky smoket into a couple of the sister who stopped so heldhafk in a couple of the sister who stopped so hero.
And one day she got a day to a poor, she was in a poor, and they got this overheavily recently they walk up seven years to seven years from now.
The pain of Tibet can be untouch of the people, but the confreezing is something to be flake.
And finally, it comes to a choice.
Would we live in a gray world of untonity or we want a color can we want a color or or a color reversity?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she peace that we direction a measured that we directly a galaxial image.
We wouldn't only be the human imagination are constrained to a small model, but also we would have been defined and forgotten that there are other options.
We can feel our nurely, in the idea that our species about [150,000] years on Earth is about 150,000] years on Earth is about about [150,000] years on Earth is about about [150,000.] years on Earth is about [150,000]
The Neolitic Revolution, which we had a agriculture in which we had to replace us to the cult of the shaman was replaced by the shaman was replaced by proshaman by proshaman by the proshaman of the priests and we got a decades.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history is not gives me the idea that we have all the answer to all the answer the question of millennia on our path.
If the intelliligic cultures of the world to the meaning of humans are being asked 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that songs that we are going to be discover the possibility to be what we are see: a consciouple of the work and can make all the gars and can be able to be flower. There are a grandmoving all the the gar.
This picture I have a picture of Baffin Island taken up with the Island taken up with Inextently in the narwal
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextent. In the 1950s, to save our sovereign, in the 1950s in the 1950s in the 1950s --
The ones of Olayuk refused to go.
The family family for his life and recorded him already already his tools are tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Interin the collapsed for the college of it.
The light in the glos of their sleeas were originally made of fish in caribs.
Olayuks up, not afraid to the poolnaight or the storm that was putting it hit to the poolnaight or the storm that became a little bit of the poolnaight or the storm that was sat.
He went out, remember his bounck of sea hondence sing skins and then frozing it was starting to freezing, he started it as a limmal he was it as a limesh he was a limma.
He brought a low-ly-playing speekings on the side of the wrong
When it was solide was, slaught a dog of them.
He recorded the dog and improvised a hearnas.
Of the ribs he made a bask of a bad one.
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood and disappeared in the ice foot and disappeared pooms.
And this is a lot of stuff around with nothing to be in a lot of ways, state symbol for the resistance of the Inin and all the inheems in the world.
In april 19999, the Canadian government the Inin the entire converted back from a piece of country larger than California and Texas it is our new home. It's called Nunavut.
It's independent. They remove all the solid straight.
It's a amazing example of how a native state enough to her people can by.
And finally, I think it's clearly to this high at least for who is at least for who is getting it from the world is really, that they actually don't get away away to get away away.
They're somebody's home country.
They are about twists of human imagination, which are going back to the beginning of time. And for us all the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, just as that one, the dreams of unconcerned geography geography of hope.
And what we finally do at National Geographic, is out of the idea that politicians never reached anything.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemonts, but we believe that stories can change the world, which we believe storytellers in the world, by the world, by the world, we probably the best tell you've probably been 35 million times a month, we have a million-shared TV and our magazining a milenvironment.
We make a fell to travel to the eat, with our audience, with our audience, to such extraordinary cultural places, where the toiral is so idented by what he seeed in the anthropology will be anthropology to be able to live in a sense of anthropology in a variety of diversity in a way to live in a multiulated world in a way to live in a way.
which all the wisdom of all the people's entirely to our semental geat.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book of the book of a book of a book of a book of a book of the question.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
I also want to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a crowd you may have been telling you a memist.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be precise the official dogma, industrialized society.
And that offician dogma, available as a follow-galaxy of our citizens, in the highest level of the level as much as possible individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good, an essential part of the human beings of the human beings
And the most of the freedom is to reach us to access a higher wheels in order to reach a higher wheels without insides without inventing thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice-sea way as possibility.
More choices love in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more wealth.
This is so deep getting rooted in our society that would be durvate in our society that would be done to it.
And in our lives this dogma, this dogma.
And I'm going to give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A middle great.
Even about dressings.
And in the super-si-sifloat-scene threat at the supermarket 10 different virgin the supermarket virgin the supermarket gaps have been getting in the super-pher.
And this is a lot of tallowed to make a threat at the time of 175 species for you, nothing about 175 species for you.
So that's the attempt of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can do itself. You can summary your stereoset et et et et et tells -- cassettesple tespeler, radio, destinker.
And in the one electronicastore.
You can be six-and-half million different systems together with parts from that wind store.
For a lot of choice, you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for a long time, you could ask all kinds of phone services, but just at Ma Bell.
Your hours it up. You wouldn't bought it.
That had the same thing that had never been the advantage that it never piece of it.
That time is forb.
And in the way that there are a lot of different across across across a lot of different across across a lot of different across across a lot of different across a lot of different across across a lot of different across across a lot of different across across across a lot of different across across a lot of
And in the mobile of cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with behind the high -- with behind brand-break levels and cry-break brand-and-break marriak level of the wire --
And if you don't have this model in the wincell in the wincell in the wincell of his that is soon.
The result of people come to the store.
And you know how the answer to that question,
No,
It's not possible a mobile of buying that doesn't do too much does not do too much it.
And in aspects of life that are more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more important than the point of choices more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more important than than the than the than the than the than the than
And the health care, it's not in the United States is not as you go to the doctor and you tell you what you have to do, and that you tell you what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A, or we can do BBy
As this front and after after that.
BBy has this front and nadle?"
And you say, "Doc, what is you find you?"
And the doctor says, "A advantage and naddling this for, and naddly.
What do you want to do you want to do?"
And you say, "D, if you were me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbrings of patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decisive decide of condition of someone who is free in the doctor -- the doctor, someone who is free the best condition to take decision, someone who is free the patient to take decisions. For on recipal measures is a lot of recipal lame is much more recipalincluding a lot of recipalmost of resistant to demble.
Good decades that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy and I wouldn't buy it.
Why administ, if we can't copy them up?
Because they think we are the next morning our doctors to ask that other branch in the morning, to ask that other brand the other brand you know, other brand that other mark,
Our identity, right? Our identity is now over, now is now over, now over, as you can see on this slide on this slide in this slide in this slide of slide to see on this slide of our existence, now is over.
Our identity is about our identitity of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want.
Everybody morning, you have to be concerned to be concerned about what is person you want to be thinking.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family family.
There is a time that free free everybody else out of it was that you possibly possible, and then as quickly as possible, and then as quickly as possible to kids.
The only choice kay, not when and what you do was not when and then you do it.
Now, free everything to it.
I left at particular intelligent students, I was double students, I was educated than the wrong househurban
They are not domestic or in the early time in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Sell I or not? As I now married to the way?
Or will I wait? Day I first children, or a care?"
These are all set of questions.
They go through them to answer them to answer them, if this means they don't get all their househurb.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave just that technology is allowing us to work every minute of every minute of every day's work, where in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love a place that I love secret I like to do it.
I don't think because I don't want to keep it for myself.
But good, which promise choice, who is in that we are increasking us question, or not.
We can look at a football date of our song, with our sone, with our cell phone, and our Blackberrief on the other hand, and our Blackberry, and the Blackberry.
And even if they all come from straightfor, we get all the minute of that competition of all kinds of question, "Am I answer this phone answer of the phone answer of the answer to the phone of the things are fightfor?
Well I response to this email, I write this letter writing writing this letter?"
And even when the answer "Nee" is, we experience the football beats of our son in a very different way.
And what we also look at the large, the small, materialist things, liststyle issues, life is a question of choos;
And this is how the world used to be looked like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks like.
The question is this good or bad bound?
The answer is, "Ja."
We all know what is good about is good about it, so I'm going to talk about it is bad about it.
That huge choice, the huge choice, two negative effects on human beings on human beings on human beings on human beings on human beings on human beings on the human beings on the human beings on the human beings.
And a very conversation effect is that it fairly paralyzed than confreezing the front of the confreezing of the confreezing away that it works before.
and so much choice, people find the hardly to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically a dramatically dramatically investigate in volunte-planning.
A follow-so-investment data, in Vanguard, a big policy creatures with about one million employees about a million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 emergency.
And they found that for every 10 policy polishing the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked on the worked for every 10 policy.
At fif-ftches did 10 percent less employees than five than five foundses. Why?
Because it at fif-from, and so hard so hard to choose that people just remember the choice as they just look at the next day, and that opened it, and so forth.
And from the point comes down.
That doesn't just mean that people after their pentive after their pentive because they don't have enough money to eat because they have not enough money to have been so hard as hard as hard as hard as hard to be a partnerships.
And they were going to have to be able to 5,000 dollars a year to go on their nose.
The worked about the worked was to double.
So too much choice, so much choice.
And I think the world is looks like that.
If it comes to the century to the century point you want to do the right choice, right?
You don't want to be reseeing up with the wrong fund, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we had the lamming of our disconnecting and choose as we had the result than it would be less of the result than it would be when we had a less options have had been having a fewer options as we had had been having a go.
There are multiple reasons for that.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from a tasy dressing, it can't be perfect.
And you ask in this case, for that a different choice would have been better better in a case of a choice for that would have been better in a case,
This dry drought alternative recently reaches you get to your choice.
And it is a good choice, the enough of choice, even if it was a good choice, even if it was a good choice.
The more options, the more options, it's a very easier to have a spike of unaway of getting electricity to the choice.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depend the value of things depending things we comparing them up.
If you think about the alternatives can invent many alternative opportunities that you were demodate the entire alternatives you demodate the attacks.
That makes you that you chose the less of alternative you have chosen bite.
A excellent excuses. And the non-New Yorkers --
This is a little bit of the stressure of example.
This is a set on valiququity in Hamptons.
They have a depensive second well.
They are at a wonderful strand. Straling weather. No human in vision.
Don't be a bad of the gusty thinks that man, "It's the augusts.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city out of the city
I could be carried my car for the door parkers."
And he is two weeks there with the idea that he mislet every single day again a great parking place a great parking place place to a great parking place
And substitutional cost of the entire choice, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are possibilities to be more attract alternatives.
And that presents us as a substitutional costs.
Another example.
This image story, took at a number of points.
Life in here, and now for example, and you have to average things.
And one point is that you can do with every choice other choices.
And all of the other has so attractivities, which is tooling option is touching option is touching the catchose of the things that are tools less attractive.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this new batch for a new batch for a new bate.
I turned to almost of them is always a little bit of it.
And it was a single kind of stuff, and it bought it was bought to be the past. The past, it didn't make it suppose unbelievable to be uncomfortable to be enough and often enough and often enough and often enough enough it right.
And after years I went to the store.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff, this is my meas."
And the window said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit?
Do you want to buy a rhy?
Do you want a blobes to closer effect?
Do you want to pipe, or flink or flink out of pipes." And so he went through and so on.
I was a spokoose of that. And after a while, I said, "I want to be the only one."
He had no idea which he had no idea which was adaptly, and so I have a hour-high hundred of the potential to be adapting.
In fact, I love this is a very honest, I ended up with a extent passensing breezing brids.
I had done better in the way, I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To this to myself, I wrote this book I wrote a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of a book of the mist, I wrote this one.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, I was that I started expecting choice, I started expecting a good includes of a good includes --
I started without any single expectancy, because I just started to know one kind of speaking of a spirit known.
And then it turned out there were different wars, and one of them would be fast perfect.
And what I was a good good these, but not perfect.
And so I recompared my breezing with my instances, and that asked me count.
The more possibilities of people have to have more expectations they coasting about the deserve of that possibilities.
And that means people are less less too, people are less less the results, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about now.
In the real thing about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse -- people could have a little bit more surprising experiences.
In our modern society, we can actually as a well as a well as a a profess, but the best thing we can ever achieve in the best we can ever achieve that something as good as we had to have in the way.
And we have ever been touched because our expectations, my expectations, and high up.
The secret of happiness -- this is a lot of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much more happiness is not too much as much as a lot of happiness is not too much as much as a lot of happiness is not too much as a lot of happiness is not too
I want to ask here -- a car-biographic element, I am with a woman who is actually fantastic element.
I won't asked her less raters.
But with less enough are takes good opportunity.
And finally, when you get a bad bad and sit as a bad bad as there is only one kind of predicting predicting, you can ask why you ask why you are intenpeacce.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different greenhouse is available to fix it it turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is just as simple -- it's like that. That's a very simple --
You had a better choice,
With hundreds of different greenhouse to failure.
So if people decided to take people decisions of that decisions are good, they are very well over their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society is clinical depression of younger generations of younger generations.
A factor -- not the end, but a significant factor in this explosive increasing explosive and suicide self-suicide experiencing experiencing experiences because of their high expectations.
And when they try to explain the representation for itself, they give themselves the decades.
So the nettoress, so we have been talking about it in the objectively is moving us bade.
Another a container of a container cludes.
This is the official dogma, that is by everybody to where is being adaptants.
But it's not.
It doesn't suffers a doubt that can choose is better than not cut out of that, but it doesn't automatically that more kills more kills is more killing choick is more killing choice,
There's a magical ground-soily fre.
But I know that we have been away to be a long time in the point that choice,
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost finished a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choices in competition is comalized countries come out of material overflowed in material over.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard before, where the problem is not so much choice, but right to be a lot of choice, but just there's too much choice.
So the paradox I speak to the moderne, so the moderne, well, which is a well-wrong for the modern,
That's frustrating, and this is frustrated, if you were told you that expensive and difficult to install, child sat at sheats in your money.
I say the same about this paper of purchoices -- they don't help -- they don't help to.
They make our lives less worth.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all of the choices to make all of the choices that people have been on it.
And our lives in the way to go forward.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by revercase of well-of-free-freedom, and it's because of the choice, we with with our choice,
And finally, if you read this image story like this sculpture as a developed person?
None is possible in a fish come."
A scrale imagination, a short square -- that was my first interpretation -- that was my first interpretty
But the longer I thought, the longer I understood better I understood that this fish is the same as a smart.
Because in fact, there's a bunch of the hand: If you get the fish crowd to create possibilities, you don't have a freedom, but a balanceous.
If you have a fish crowd to create potential to create potential of the potential jobs to create potential.
