Last year I showed these two dia's to show that the pool, which was the pool, which was the last three million years of the vastant was about the size of the fix of the fix-percent of the U.S. and 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is the way this particular problem because it doesn't show the closer to the animal of the ice of ice that ice is not showing the disk.
The ice skap on the North Pole is in a way, in a way, in the close of our global climate system.
It turned out in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide that I shows is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is approached in the red.
As you see, it turned out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice of the year,
And it is in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years or parent, five years or parent, is almost like blood, that from the body.
In 25 years is it from this to this stuff in this way.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen was frozen around the Northern Ictual warming and there is a very big amount of woman, and it's a very big amount of woman.
Comertaking total amount of disility in the atmosphere, that could be disfrace, that could be double as we consider the circle point.
In some indeep die-deep in Alaska signs of all of the water.
Again, Professor Katey Walter of the University of the University of Alaska with another one.
Why! She's OK. The question is the question is going to be that will be going to be that will be wrong.
A reason for that, that's this massive heat bron" Greenland from the north.
This is a melt melt domestic divier.
The water volume is echer than echer it is larger than equivalent to the water's larger than equivalent to the waterm is larger than e.
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea sea because it is the landice because it is the size, this is the place where it is the place where it comes into the sea.
These stromons are flu.
At the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, is the greatest ice mass on the earth.
For last month, reported scientists that the whole continent now is a negative ice balance of the negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole, very quickly soon to the melting with some of waterers.
The whole continent to be seeing for six meter seespear, like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of the mass ice mass, are now new now, which was going to have a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that meltable.
In the Andes, this glestar in the Andes, the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more strows.
But when they disappearing it is the drink-water.
In California was there was a divermination of 40 percent in the snowpack.
It is in the water reservoires in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions at it.
This global dreaming of the dreaming of bos' fuels.
And the number of course, the whole world is spend with an incredible and never seen any speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the previous 75 years.
This is completely unlike this pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 ton CO2 every 24 hours.
25 mios ton every day in our oceans, look at the equivalent of the Stille Ocean, from America, and in every single of the Indian substant, there is a stical daling of Indian extent of the ocean in the oceans.
The only big cause of the operating warming of the earth, is to deforest as as it is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and steengineering is the very largest problem.
The United States, one of the two largest extinct with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban centrales in it.
But we see a couple of the circle.
These are the coal-carbon centrales that the ball of the bigger alternatives were done alternatives were precidented in the last years.
There is a policy of the political freedom.
The urban carbon -- and oil industry gave years to promote "scone" to promote "scone" to promote "Co-coal coal is a conversation.
And that image did something like something like that.
And the guy was in Tennessee, about four billion literally crol model.
You have seen it probably in the news.
This is the one after one after the biggest dismanufacturing in America.
This was happening around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the support link on the Kerst.
Video: ""Frosty the stead, the stead, is a stage, embedded guy.
He is folding the way here in America, and he's growing us in America, and he's growing our economy.
Frosty the coal man is becomes a shot on the day
He is paid and cattch, and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia.
The largest mines of the country is the big blaunes of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguage of the Don Blanguage of the Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have talking about what they haven't know about what they haven't talking about about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the too.
This is a piece of a did.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our things.
That's the reason why the most important thing is to give us a giant tantic behaviors to the light and bring it to the light and the lead of the truth of the truth of truth is about the truth of truth is about the truth is about the truth of truth is about the truth is to the light of the
Fit is, coal is not smaril.
We think it's sketly -- and it still seems -- and it still still seet.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me talk about us.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shows cools
Fantastic. The machines are pretty some lawys.
But that's the sound of showing a sound of creating carbon technology.
In dance the fact that the sburning of steencoal is one of the most important warming of the Earth, the remarkable is the remarkable shapes that you see everything.
Look ook well around this shows technology of today is the lady.
Al Gore: Einventually past the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative ality.
Video: Stem: U.S. America wrong economy, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red wireless is our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuel like dirted oil, like the vouter oil,
But now there's a purpose new solution to get out of this.
Forth America of 100 percent of showing electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get to work to work to work on the work is that makes us safe and the operating warming the Earth of the Earth of the Earth is a fall.
And eventually a solution that definding is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Extded.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Mo: Mo: It's about re-instance,
One of the speed ways to make a end of our dependence of old and focus of old fuel that we have to help our planet to help that our planet to help see.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Of 2: Of 2: Of course jobs to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There is an old African old African old African old African's spot to be everything.
If you want to go far far far to do."
We have to go far far far and fast.
Thank you.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am here is the most of those who haven't waren: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever scientific experiment ever in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge.
It has to be the circumstances that were further than a billion, less than a billivest second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitious, so, so!
This is the machine Genevil.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter breed, 22 meter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the grain so that you can see the scale.
At 10 setember last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that worked for a partor a partment in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle straight, which is all around the way around the LHC and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was bounded in the detector of the flower.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that worked on the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across the largest of this is that when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of saw that the Internet page of saw that the Internet page of this is so much of the things that is so much of the things that is so far.
And that means we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we have made a kind of impact that we have made a kind of impact as a scientific impact
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
They were 13 thousand of ampeering bater when the machine on full power.
The engineers will say, "Not true will say, "Not true. It's too small behavior."
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago,
So on min 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, that can read that flow that flow that flow that flow that flow power.
In one of the connectivated between the nets of a thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
It was the wireless was something warmer, and there was intended to be electrical resisted that 13 thousand ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that that the magnets are more than 20 ton, and they were put about 30 inches in the front of the magnets were most.
We civil to 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did it.
We all have them when we all display them at the time.
Now they're back on the way.
Eind will be the LHC will be intact.
We'll expect it to expect it to expect to be able to expect it to look for what the way to do is what the building is what the building is the universe.
Now, of course, that are going to be reincidents the debate of the value of scientific research.
I think that the fact that it's so hard is that we go farther than the way it is the LHC.
I showing the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I had to deal with me, during the value of the value of the value experiments of his teacher, his teacher-to-day experiments of the human mind is so dangerous for the progress, that we have to take our images of human mind that we have not been able to take aways, that there are not a new global world that are in the nature, and that there are no new gard."
Thank you.
I want to start to asking you back to your childhood to your childhood when you played with blocks
When you discovered how you had to grab them up and they were picking up and conscious problems by learning and traveling the way by and hands of space relations.
Rumtelevisial is destrong with understanding the world to understand from the world to it.
If an information is inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with objects -- with my advisur Pattion and my fash -- began to ask me to ask -- what if we were using a computer -- what if we were using a computer of digital finger at the environment that we could use a plate of digital characteristic blay, we can we have to far with those individuals with information
and we can orderize as we want to do it?
These question that we decided that we decided to find an answer by building the building of Siftables.
Sort society is a Siftable computer in a size of a cow of a cow of a cow of a cow-cow
They can be moved, they can be moved, they can feel together their movement and they were able to feel a screen and wireless and wireless and wireless and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be the physical treatment by grabs can be moved by grabs.
And the top of the top of the same way from a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that these aid tools have a more physical differentire of their movement and each other, and even from each other, and even of the way we move them are different new and fun interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is instated to tell a video that is playing by the size of the calls and others playing other and others played by the size of the call.
These interactive portraits of consciousness.
Indians as we put together, they will be interested in to each other.
If they get surround, they can notice this and what nervous is that nervous way.
And they have to feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all of these interactions, as it looks like it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a fluid of color as it was a fluid of the interaction,
In this example three Sifttables emmers to be able to go color in a very very much to good, where they become color in a very long time.
If we have far over the threatened we went back a little bit of the back.
There are some of crazy craft for education, especially playing, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility and logics that we want to give people the possibility to see the outside of the immediately,
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple computer programmate.
And here we show a game that is a crossing between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of any Sifttable, and dangered words are controlled in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds is very really, it really, and applies a new series of letters with behind with the similar possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some of kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the way.
They were actually away.
And one of the most interesting things that are going to have to be instructions of this application is that people needs.
Everything you have to say is "Move word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people to testing it.
That's our younest bone-ster bone-strong.
But, it just like the Sifttables lived in the Sifttables
For him this was just blocks.
Here is an interactive painting.
We wanted to have a platform for learning to develop language of language
This is Felix that demonstrated.
He can bring new carakters in the scene of the Siftloor, with that caract.
Here he shows the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he's got a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good dy! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the scue of Siftables and the next to each other, he can put the carakters to each other, and then we have to get the carakters with each other -- Video: Wa!
D: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
D: It's a story with a open end.
and he decided how it goes to get it.
Video: The cat flight.
D: The last example that I will show you today to show Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed with a sound producing that we have developed a sound as the lead, bass and pressure pressed.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use that you can choose what you want to use what you want to use what you want to use it in the engineers,
These happen in the age of Siftables are injected so that you can see the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the way from a very very much Sifttangible effects like reverb and filter.
They are being able to cell and applied by the side.
And the most general effects like temo and volume that are advantage that are advantage that are the whole pattern.
Let's look at that.
Video: Do we start with a living in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, by a lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: Do I add to add some beat.
Video: So I get the movie I get the movie to the print, so that I can affect the effect of life.
Video: Do can get it very quick by the size of the tempo blocky.
Video: Do I get the movie I get the movie for what more expression.
Video: Do you repair of the pattern as it is playing.
So I don't have to plant all the way to plan, but I can improvise it all very longer and shorter as I want to want to do it.
In the end of the dimms of the dimms of the volume Siftable to left Siftolotable to celerate the left.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is going to make new people, is what we do is the better interfaces that are better in the way our brains and bodies and bodies and bodies and bodies working together.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design, in this design area that we developed with some possibilities that we develop in the lab.
The thought that I want to bring about is that this is just the attacked to a very new generation to the interacting with digital media that is bring the information to our world as we want to bring it into our world as we want it.
I thank you from hard.
I look at them to talk to you to all of you all and talk to you to all of you.
I'm writing.
But, you know, is my work, but also so many more than that.
My whole life for for my life long as I would have been setting writing that will change ever change that will change ever change that will change that will change change that will change change that will change ever change will change it.
And yet there is unmostly in my life and career and career and career that I had to see my relationship with my work again.
It started with a book that I had wrote ungs a memoire: Beminnen," Beminnen," which is very very in contratradinary work all over and an international exist.
The consequence, that people are all all all all the way and always told me as if I do do do do --
And we do anything that -- do is doing doing it!
People come to me and questions to me and questions "Don't you get that succes?
Don't you get to write your whole life will be writing you will never have a book that people will be able to publish in the way to get warm.
Don't you get to far that.
Frg disappointing, you know.
Of course, that would be very very of, I remember that I was in 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I was told that I wanted to become a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get succes?
Don't you get to be far, that you will go to the way you will go to you?
Don't you get your life to this work will be that there is that there ever something that is that there ever something that is that you will be done that you will be able to dry your bitter-bitter-a-a-from falen?"
Something in that streting.
In the short is my answer to that questions on this is "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called called all those things that are called
All of the time.
But I'm also for a lot of other things job, you don't know what everything for all of the things that everything.
For example, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing to write myself the last time when that angst is what that angst is what that angle.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be jobs for working for the work for where they are going to their opinion.
What is that there is so particular to creative processes that we make sure the effects of the mindnesses of the mindness of the mind-work is not going to happen.
Take me my father. He was shot engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he worked on the 40 years he was working on him or he was not afraid to him or he was not that for that was far.
And that's how to do you like this, how are it with your chemist?"
No, no, so there was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been separated by the centuries have been not the reputation of manically.
Scheat, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not only writing, writing, other creative people have been pretty instable, the reputation of people.
Look at the grimming doctors under the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many died young is often by doing it.
And even those who don't have a suicide of suicide to be under their gave to be considered to be suicians.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Don't each of my books is a piece of mine of myself."
That's pretty much to say that you have to say about your life.
But of this kind of excells we look up to look at it.
We all heard it before, and have heard it with all and accepted.
The teaching is that creativity is that creativity inlosing with suffering and that a artistic existence will lead to misery.
So that's why everybody here today I ask everyone here today that idea is living to live with that idea is living to live with that idea is why you can you live with that idea of life?
Do you think that OK?
Because I think about it, I think about it, I don't think it's all a pretty fairly thought.
I think it is the re-inflect requency.
And also even more dangerous.
I don't like to see that this century is so on.
We can creative mind to be a lot better better than to live a lot of better to live
I know that it would be for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark in my mind-thoughdark in my thought.
Actually, the phase that is in my career is now in my career is now in my career on the career is now in the career on the career
Go took only after you can do a little bit ambat.
I can do maybe four decades.
And the Hoogstrainy is all I have now now now in the outside world as the work that is that extraordinary in that outside of that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can be selling you is probably the biggest success.
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think that you're going to think about you know the morning to know in the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to me with the work that I love with the work that I love to work that I love to love with the work that I love to work that I love to love with the work that I love to do it.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just just by writing a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process inet.
I have to think of the writing a safe distance between myself and my considered and my very understanding fear of reactions, and my very understanding automorror case in my future automorror city of the reactions.
I have been looking for the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of history, and I do do in other civilizations to see or others to see whether others have found a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My search of my search and I was getting me to the old Greeks and Rombs and Romban and Rombons.
Let me have a long long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombs and Rombs people don't have that creativity of themselves from themselves from themselves
And believed that creativity was a godd-part, which was a distincluding place to the human seemed to the human saddomins.
The Greres called these these are calling creativity "demonen."
And Socratate, believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that was influistence.
The Romeinand had a species of idea.
And you know, you have this been such a bottom of the genius is a genie.
The funny is that the Rombs with a genius with a genius with a genius in a particular person
In their policy was a genius a kind of magic godd-entities that were in the walls of the ateler of the ateler of the artist.
A little bit like Dobby the huisely.
If the artistic thing was working on the genius assistance.
And the way he gave form to the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first thing about before, the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work
The artists was so in protection to be much narcism.
If you were brilliant, you don't get all the eggard.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius to have healing.
Wake your work was crowd, you know, it's not just to you,
Everybody knew that you had a pretty independent genius.
Long time is that that had been how in the West creativity was considered to be considered
Then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed
There is a very new idea: the individual ment, the individual ments is the middle of the universe and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godddline world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual flow.
And for the first thing in history, there was a about artists said that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not have a genius and they had a genie.
I have to say that I think that a big from,
To person, one single individual individuals that he or they are the couple of the century of the century mystery, of all the eternal mystery, of all the stuff of all of the stuff -- that's something that is to be a very much for a fragile human psyche.
Also, or you ask someone asks the sun in soft.
Egos are building up to smigantic proporations and there are increasingly expectations to prestations of expectations to be copying.
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years of artists pursus made a lot of artists.
If that is that that is that I think is the question is: "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the human and creative mysterious mysterious and creative mysterious mysterious and creative mysterious mysterious engineer?
Maybe not.
We can be able to rational male 500 years of rational humanism not undone in 18 minutes
In the audience in the audience people who are reducing scientific doubt of doubs with some of fact that eleros with some partment of the work of artists with some partment.
It doesn't seem to me that I will all get you in there.
And yet, I ask it out.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that thought is that we don't have to do that though?
The fasts just as much as much as all other explanations of the totally calculated unknown that are includes in the creative process.
Everybody who have to create something that is to create all the attacked all the attacks here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process is not always rational process to creative process to be rational process.
And that sometimes it feeling in the engineer.
I have under the great American closer to the great American closer Ruth Stone of the great.
She's thick is in the nine. Her whole life already writing them close.
She told me about her childhood on the plattemptation of Virginia.
Somes, if she was on the field of the work was felt to the work was felt following a poem about the country.
It was so one, as if there was a big wave air.
And so a poem than the country to her country to her devoice.
She felt that the ground, and she was started to shuddly, and that moment, and one thing that is to do is to do that when it was done for her life.
They ran home, and they were running by the close and they had to get as quickly as possible and paper to pick up and paper to pick up and paper to get and paper to get the close to be able to get the close and paper to get it as quickly to get to the paper to get to get into the paper to get to them out of the pap
When the close by her han close by her hand that was her only opportunity to write it on the way to write it in the waves of the poem was to write it was to write it was to write it was to write it was to write.
Sometimes she was not very quickly.
Then ring and ring it, but it doesn't have the house.
In this time, it shows the close by her poems, the poem of the fields, search -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another another.
And we were able to have -- this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were the close to almost of the story.
Then she was looking for it and paper and paper, and paper, and paper it by the close by her himes.
Junew at that time, she had a potleg she had a potled.
And with her other hand, so told me them, she plured it from the air.
She paked it close to his tail, and it back in her body, while she was going to wrote it back in her body,
And in that cases came up to the close to be close in the paper, but then in the entire followed followed fold.
When I think that -- what is happen, I thought -- what is that it is that my creative proces!
This is what my creative proces! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouth, who is a mouth, who is the same time on the same time and trans and fall, and trans on the way and trans on it.
But even in that daily flowing that daily had such such a experience.
You will also know it yourself, that sense that there are creative ideas in your refrigation from a source that you can identify.
What is that fun for bron?
How can we use it without say?
At a way that is that good for us to do it?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician's Tom Was.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a while,
We had this about this.
Tom is a big part of his life was a big part of his life was showing the showwed of the gecrazy artists that are trying to get in the impulse of the impulse of impulse in him up.
With the years was Tom was a little bit more rery.
And one day he was in Los Angeles on the fast weight, and changed the process of radical.
As he was so really, he heard a fragment, he heard a cliodie.
The decided to be able to do that, like inspiration that is degrab, crossing.
It was a beautiful melodd and he wanted it to fashion the vasthority.
But that doesn't go to that.
He had no paper -- no paper to see no taneously no tancy in the time.
The well-known excise that is a considered of the "I get the too, and then it stays and then it stays and then it stays and then it stays and then it stays to me eube.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get in panic, but he didn't get in panic, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new ws.
And he looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, can you see that I sat the point?"
"Do you think that I can write a song now,
If you really want this song that this song that this song later, you have to add when I have time for you.
Don't do anyone else to be different.
Go neighborhood at Leonard Cohen." And from that time the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of Lonard
The work is the same thing that is the same thing with the known dark on the bottom of the work.
But the heavy exciting that creative process in him report of the genius when he distance distance of gene.
The genius was going to have the skin, and the pair and livery, but it was just like that.
And so that there was no reason that there was no reason to go to the hold.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the property and the propertent aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working changed
I had been proficty.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddle of Ets, Beminners.
At a moment I agree in despers.
You know that you want to be working but not to be good and you think it's a terrible disaptic disappoint. The book ook ook ook a terrible book ook ook a horrible book ook ook ook ook ook ook a terrible disappe
Not solid bad -- really really really bad bad bad bad and it's really bad to it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the whole project.
And then I remember Tom that was remember, and I decided to way.
I wended me from my manuscrip, and I was going to a very very much of the room.
And I said hardoper: "Loty, we know all of that if this book is not just to brilliant is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in the way in what I've got in me.
I don't want to give you to it.
If you think it's better better than you have to get your thing to get your thing to get your thing to do.
Snap you don't do that, you ammer not, you ammer not, you ammer
I just write because that's one of them because that's one of my work.
Oh, and in the notils are seeing that is just a lot of the cantor is just a different."
Tja--- Utintually, it is going to be in this ...
Eeuws ago, in the North African desert of people together to dance in month, to dance in month,
Ors and hours and hours, to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes happened to be something extraordinary in something extraordinary in it.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen that you ever see that something in a performer.
It was like the time was saying and the dance of the poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now everything together.
And suddenly not just a human beings just a human beings a human beings for a human beings.
In him of him is above him of glous.
A goddly four fours of him.
If something called "Allah, Allah, people what it was started to clap and clap them and crops, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
Because that was for them.
And by the way, a fun of historical part, when the Moren Spanish Spanish Spanin Spanish Spanin this way.
The crosson is the echer by the centuries of "Allah." Allah." Allah." Allah."
And that you have to do that the day in the day of flaments and flaments and flaments and flaimments
If an artists in Spain something impossible or magic does, "Allah, oil oil -- "Allah, h, great, Allah, great, Allah, violene, well, Allah, violend, oil, well, or magic --
Anounderstanding of God.
Actually, what we need.
Lastig is that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the next morning to discover on dinary during 11 hours don't have a godddline of it.
At that moment, he's a little bit elder with these parents that will never get to such a little bit of the wheights will never get to such a little bit of the well.
Maybe there will be somebody to do anything else in his dancing dances.
What do is that we have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sells for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be not to be too to be able to be in it.
Now, imagine that you don't want to get the most imusually immediately aspects of your person from your person from your person from your person from your person
Now, imagine that you believe that you have a while, you know, you have a while,
When you do it with it, they are given to someone else.
And that's how it is all the way it is all of it.
I hang intools that are thought to be thought to the day.
The last months I've worked on a book that will be a book that will be soon, and the book where a lot of regular to be looked at is extincludes looked at is extincludes.
The resevers of illuster of illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the hall, I like the same thing I like the same ones don't know the same one.
Do just you work.
For just you do thing you do is what it is.
If you have task to dance, you go to dance it.
If the godd-genius that you have been decision to make in your work at a few moment, you know, you know, you have been by doing something about the wonderful sourcing in the way, then "Oly!"
As it doesn't matter -- though then, then, you know, this:
And then, "Ole!"
I believe that that I believe that of hard.
"Olet me how we do do anyway, because we are pure human love and propertly, we are staying by staying and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and the discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the digitize of the digital code and now we are trying to go from that digital code to a new fase in the biology and synthesize of life.
So we always have tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that have been trying to understand what biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have been trying to understand in different levels of biologists.
We tried different approaches to bring into minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years.
When we have the human genome genome genome of the human genome of the biology, went from the analog world of the computer.
Now, we try to ask to ask life to create regeneral, we can create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can be considered in a laboratory that can be considered in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nice nature called a nature genome of genome genome
We can take in the order of hundred genes from the 500 or something, which are there.
But if we look at the metaboolic map, is simply simply simply aging with the one.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can look at all the genes that would be very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell that this would be able to do a living cell cell that would be able to do a living cell cell that would be able to look at all the genes that would be able to be a living cell cell cell cel
And we decided to do that the only route of the most route was to synthetisate this chromosomes so we could deal with the components to be able to ask the components to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we have a chromosome, "Command?"
Staat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules that we have never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome "restart."
A chromosome is a chemical inctive and a piece of chemical inds material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of the digitize of life is across exponential way.
Our power to write the genetic code of the genetic code of slowly slowly slow-size.
And our last point it would put on this moments on a exponential curve.
We're now began to be 15 years ago.
There were some stages for a few stages for a bio-ethical ethical ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult is very difficult to be very difficult to be the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the synth
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA 30 to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of it makes it more false.
So we had to make a new method for the tiny of these little pieces and corrigate of all the bottomorate of all the bottomorate of all the botoms.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, were the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we stop a piece of chemical chemical code in the bacteria and the bacteria and viral particles and viral particles and viral particles and viral particles and making viral particles and making all of the genetic code,
The viral particles were done of the cells, they came back and they came back and death the E. coli.
I was under to speak with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said they have to well.
They laughing more than you lose to lay
So we think this is a situation where the software is to build its own hardware are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we decided to build them in cassettes in cassettes in cassettes that we could various --
to get to understand what the stuff is the way that are the way from a living cell cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start start with digital information in the computer than to the digital information that are very accuravel information in the computer than that are very accurassing to be very accurage.
When we first first this genome for the first time in 1995 was the standard-precision one falthough separat.
And eventually we found after resequencing 30 folds. If we had the original sequence.
Actually, the design is the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to be able to build up with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to build as a lot of these are unities that we have to build together so they can be able to build together.
We design here unique parts in it.
Maybe you have read that we stop waters.
Bet, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, GG.
Trios of that code for every single 20 aminozurs -- that there is a one of the aminoxygen for every aminoxygen of every aminoxygen
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts.
And we have been signature to be just in the way to be able to do it.
Some of the teleurated that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat and syms.
There are enzymes that they put them and together.
And we started to make pieces of making pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were setting to 7,000 letters were able to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every city we were able to do a floun-flock of these pieces so we could create them because we want to create a process that will be very robuying that will be very robuying you are going to see the straight.
We try to get the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
As dra is we come to the really big pieces -- 100,000 baseparies -- then they don't grow as much more in E. coli.
And that explains the most of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And that's why we went to get to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-oil repairs that is used by the biology to repairs, that can add DNA to repair of the biology to repair of a crazy of the way to repair of the biology to repair of a mechanism that can add DNA is that can add DNA
Here's an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radiation of radiation.
And that you see in the top panel, som is just like chromosome of chromosome of each other.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it down in each other, exactly like it was first to be in the galaxy.
There are thousands of organisms that are.
These organisms can be drought up to be drood.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be absolutely in space that can profession that can be able to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been able to see that there is many of it is out there.
Here is a very deal microph of the molecule we made with these processes -- in fact, with these processes -- in fact, with just yesterday with the right design.
Great it is that they add automatically
This is not electron-microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences we get out of the audience.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages to pressure.
Well, how do we started, how do we start to get a chromosome? How do we have it to do it?
And it's clear a virus of the virus is pretty easy.
And we have a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like us, you whose what, you know, you what, and that's what you know when you know if it is what you know when it is what you know when it is what you know when it is the clones.
And you can get the bacteria is the chromospher, but we have integrated in the cell, but we have a complete transplantation of a chromosome, we can explain a chromosome, and it can be able to requency to another another, and can activvate activation.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome.
These are about as far from each other.
We added some extra little bit of extra to this chromosome.
We have the distincted, and we have all the eggas to make all the eggars.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced graphical images here -- the new chromosome, and it was new chromosome.
We even thought that he would come to come to to the process of it would be able to develop the process of what we thought it would be able to develop the process of what we thought would be able to develop the process of what would come further.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of these species that have a second chromosome of these thousands or a third of thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution proposing evolved, you know, one of the biology.
There are enzymes that restricti-enzymes are called DNA is called DNA is going to get DNA
The chromospherited that in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome, we put in it -- well, well.
It was express, and it was expresent the other chromosome, and it was a strange of material, and that's why we had just the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time away all the characteristics of one species and changed in the new species of based on the new software that we in the cell we put in the cell we put in the cell we stop.
All the eggged membranes -- when we were the genetic code -- it was changed the genetic code where it was changed.
This is what this is as genomic, and we are in the state alchemistry, but we are in the software DNA, to change things fundamental -- to change things fundamental --
Good, I've been paid that this is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is previous for 3.5 billion years evolution, and I've paid I paid that we might be able to be a new version of the Cambrical explosion of the Cambranched on this digital new species of scale new species of call,
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it's pretty much as you look at what is needed to what is going on.
We're going to be in ses-and-a-half billion people, during the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context of 1946.
There are now three people on this planet...
for each of us who live in 1946; within 460 years, that there are four years.
We have a lot of food, with the food, with the heavy water, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That's hard to do that for noise to do that for now.
We use five billion ton colleges, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of fattacks.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace; then that's going to be a huge challenge.
Then there is all those carbon dioxide of the state of the atmosphere.
And by all of our global discovering we have a databulous that I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is coming from the diversity that is come from the diversity that is come from there.
We are prestently by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of thanks they have to do this methods to do so called combination genomics called combination genomics."
We have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the transfer of 20 million different genes or try to optimalizing processes to produce octaneous to produce octaneously new vaccins, we can change with a small team we can change with a small team than in the last 20 years.
And it's just just a selection.
We can select for living vatibary, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen imagination of what real design is what real designer is where we can really get to the gang and a new kind of on the computer and a new kind of on the computer of computer in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the real design and can design and a new kind of design and can design is to design and a new kind of design and a new kind of thing that can design kind of design and design and make a new kind of design kind of a new kind of design kind of working on the way of thing
We don't know how it will see out of how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus now fourth of fourth generation.
As have you see, you know, ethanol ethanol of an experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come out of the sugar like sugar to be like sugar to more higher fuels like occaserats like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can have a big influence can have no food prices and the available and the available and the available is when we start with CO2 as his food, and why we are cells that we are cells that we do the first thing and we do is that we think we have the first fourth generation and within about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries are all other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deepice, about 2.5 miles in the deep, in cost temperature of temperaturs.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy fun hydrogen as energy fun of energy source
We are looking at the way we have to take CO2 and we can be able to be aware in fabried, where that is that CO2 is fabried, where that is come back to follow this process.
So in a short during in a short of the basic question: "What is life?"
We have real, you know, we have a little bit -- have the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where you can't do this at TED, what do is what do do do do do it?
A important energy source is going to be a major energy source
But we work now now now we're also doing the way to think of these tools to think of vaccines to think of these tools
This year there was the flu, we always have a little bit behind the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that that can change by tempting form by tempting vaccines
So here you see how the future can see the future is going to change the evolution tree, the evolution tree, the evolution tree, with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still disturally distant to improve people.
Our goal is survive that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive for a long time. Thank you very much.
What I want you to show you as a first quickly, the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft this is Seedragone. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment in which you can locally or on the distance with immense visual data can work in the way.
We look at the time, we look at digital images and can stay in the way to stay inable and except it to be in and exploiting our wish and the sorts to our wish to our wish to our wish and the sorts of our wiss.
And it doesn't matter how many information we look at how much information, how big these collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 meapix.
It all makes nothing because it was just because the only thing that would be influence, on a third of the same way to be the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a very example of non-imaginative data.
This is the graue house by Dickens. Each colutile is a head-up piece.
To point that it is really text that is really text and not imagination, we can do something to show that this is really text isn't a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange way to read a way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a e-book way to read a very e-book way to read
I wouldn't be adapty.
This is a realistic example. This is a example,
Every big image is the beginning of a subject of a bottom
This is really gives you really look at the point, and the experience of a real paper of time or newspaper, which is a scale medium is a scale medium is.
We also have done something with the corner of this extended from The Guardian.
We have a nep advertions of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information.
If you see the possibilities of this car seats of this car seat.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of trade through the screen through the screen at the time.
We hope that this is not pop-ups more pop-ups and other such -- not needed to be more than to be more to be more than to be more than to be more than to be more than it is not needed to be more population and other third that is not going to be more pop-ups
Of course, a lot of course for the hand the application for a technology like this, I'm going to talk to a technology like this, I'm not going to spend a lot of time we can be able to behavided a lot of more than to be able to behave, except that we can be able to behavior to be able to behave, except that we can be able to be able to behavioral for a technology as it can be a lot of technology like this, I don't have a lot of these fielseeing as a technology like this,
These are all the roads in the U.S.
on top on top on top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who engines two engineering together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promoter to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz on University on University on University on University on University on University on University of Washington, and the University of Washington, and the University of Washington is on and the Uni
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's measured by Seadragon.
When we do this is that we see by the images we can experience and experience the multi-resolution.
The room of the images of the images has this meaning is this meaning is this meaning.
The computer vision of the vision of these images have these images together, so they have to the real space -- the Grassi in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are elected from stabilizing the circle of stabilized diashost of these things are space and all these things are space towards and all these things are space.
I don't know if there is another time or there is another environments.
There are a lot of space that are a lot of space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototype of Photosynth that we worked on this summer, which I have in my head is the realm of these engineering power is the realm of this environments on our website.
We had to keep with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just searching Notre Dame in Flickr, and you get images of people in the t-shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get from the Notre Dame with you can get from Flickr.
And each of these orange chgely gives a image that model turns out of this model turns out to be part of this model turned out to be part of this model of this model turned out to be part of this model of this model turns out to be part of this orange of this orange chest.
And so all of Flickr images that are seeing this way of space in this way.
And we can be able to get simple education.
You know, I had never thought that I would have ever thought I would have ever worked at Microsoft.
It's overwhelse is the way to become so extincluded.
I believe you can see that this is that this many types of cameras are to mirror reflexcameras a big number of third reflexuals, a lot of these,
I'm going to try to find some strange images.
There are so many works by seeing faces and so on.
Exwhere between this is even a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is churted by program.
If we have four via in the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do things with the social environment with social environment. This is the data -- from the whole collective memory of the whole collective memory that everything else -- and heading that everything else to each other.
All these pictures are considered together, and forming together a little bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth
As a follow on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Again,
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it as they use it to the people who use it.
Their own pictures are provide to be metape data that somebody else inved.
If someone would like to get these healthough of these are going to be able to get them to be amazing the Notre Dame is that data, and that can use that, and that I use as a access to the space, that can use metape versus of every pictures, and create a kind of cruise modales and create social experience.
And of course, it's producing a immense rich of this is an immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not only from air, and other applications and other applications is until and other applications, but also from the collective seats of the collective seat.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what you know is possible to a day in the next year, in the next years, all of the images that are being done by everyone in the world can copy in the world can copy in the world can get together in the world.
BA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering
It creates, to create your wise, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the imaginations.
And that is being exciting exciting when you think about the richchcheese information that is available to do a lot of these imagins.
When you look for imagine, you can find a search for images, you feel a search and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagination is a much information about what the image we have a lot of information about what the imagination.
What if this is the image coped imagination to all your images?
Then are the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that is very small-cope that is a classic networks.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitors.
One of the intense pleasure of events and of enographics is the possibility to live between those who are the old living in the ancient living in the wind, which are still feeling their paths in the wind, the proted, the profiterate by the raise of bitters.
The science that Jaxhamans still preventing the Milky galaxy or that the myths of Inchest-parent meant with meaning whether that in the Himalaya boodhand still make the breath, and you really remember that is still to be able to do that, in fact, you really don't really remember a complete of anthropology is not in an absolutely to be in a solution of the real way of the reality, but is not a few workness of the work,
the consequence of a approxious set that we made our ancestors that created our ancestors.
Of course, we all share the same applied during during the same fit was born children. Brengors. Brender.
We all make all inforce of inducation rites.
Actually, with the ineverbal dissection by death the box.
So it can't be surprise that we all of them and they art.
But interesting is the unique of the song and the rhythm of the dance of dances in every different culture.
Or now that is about the Penan in the wolden on Borneo, or the Voodood acolites in Haiti or the Caiut in the Kaisut in North Kenya, the Curo in the Andes-Kenya, the Caravanai in the Sahara. This is the Caravana's heart. This is the guy with with the whether of the desert of the desert of the desert of Caravices -- or a mazed -- or a magagagagaher,
Everest, the god-mom mother.
They all learn we learn that we can think different, we can think of them different.
If you think about it, you can just give you a lot of you just hope to give you hope.
Samen forms the intelligentle-cultures in the world a web of spiritual and culturally as important as the biological life is as important as the biological life web: the biosphere.
This cultural life web is a very way you can imagine as a enosfting.
The nos: The nos: you can define as the totally of all the thoughts, droms, myths, myths, and intuitions and intuitions that are previous imagination since the beginning of our consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The extense is the big nalaturity of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all of that we can be and all that we can be as amazing new new new new new new new and more excited.
Not like the biosphere is the equivalent is the equivalent that eyes -- and even in much larger mate.
No biologist, would be a biologist, and that least half of all the species of the species of the species of extinct of the species of state, because that's simply not where it is simply not where
And then, the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the nearly optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the losing is the losing of this is the loss.
When everybody here was born to be born there, there were six-thousand of talks on Earth.
A language is more than her word-scat or her grammatical rules
A language is a frockering of human visual human vision.
It's the vehicle that is the sicl of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century entered old old and a separation, a creation of an ecosystem to spiritual potential possibilities.
From that six-thousand of talks today is the day the noday of that is not more in children in the children in the children in the children.
They are not going to be longer touched to be longer there.
Effective means that unless a change, that they are already dead.
Is there something like this, you know, the last of the held of the past of your ential is to speak to speak to speak the wisdom of the promise of the promise of the children have to see or the regular of the kids have to see the kids of the kids have to see the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the kids of the children in the way by savings of

Some of you say, "Super, don't like the world are the world if we all all the way as we all all the same language of the same language of the same language of Yoruba tom. Or Kantonetons.
Or Kogi.' ' you can realize how it would be able to talk to you to talk to to you to talk to to you.
So what I want to do is what you can take you on a short of the enosphere, which is to be a picture of what in fact, which is going to be a picture of what in fact,
And many of us forgotten that when I have to be about "another way I have to do this is a very different ways.

One of the fascinating that I've been with with which I have ago, the Waorani in North Ecuador, a follow in North Ecuador, a follow outside which in 1958 trail.
In 1957 five missionaries are contact to explain in 1957 and they made a critical falt.
In the air, the air, they photographs of themselves with our ideas, where they were going to get to us to the friendly that this has never seen a second dimensional image had never seen a second dimensional image had never seen a second dimensional pictures,
They were photographs and tried to find the face behind the face.
When they didn't have anything to follow them that the thumberate with this is that the thue with speaking with sparents with speaking with sparen't been farmed with speaking with spard.
But the Waorani are not just outside, but also each other.
For 50 percent of their deattacks of their deastinctions
We could be able to eight generate eight generations, where we found two casses of a natural dead.
When we continued to do that one man had ever been amazing that one man of parendom stierf, but the same time they had a amazing part. But at the same time.
Their jagers could be able to 40 pass on 40 pass and tell what animals.
Begin '80s, I got a amazing behavior, when my professor I wanted to get to Haiti to inmovation that was a secret gene genomic genome of the power of president Duvaler as a president Duvalengineering Duvalengineers and so it gas it gives to be safe and so it guns out of which is made it makes out of summarily as well-falls out of the posed to intttings that is is in the way from which is is made made made made it gigigigigigigigigigigigion
And to think of these sensational things that can understand what we have to learn something about this particular particular of Vodou, which is not cult of the magic.

If we think of inheemse to be inhead, and we often Rousand of Rouad and the old factor, a idea that racistic in his simple because of the edelay.

I grow up in the botons of British Columbia with the idea that these bosses were crazes to be cut out of the botoms.
And that made me another opinions of the Kuxcement of the Kwagiults that those bosses that that are botoms the lives of Kuxwhue and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the oplebal minds.
These minds are important time to be their Hamatsa-inted.
If you start to get the idea that these cultures of the idea that these cultures can be able to get to get to a few of their extraordinary discoverovery.
It's a picture that I april in the North Amazone nam.
This is ayahou, the most powerful psychoactive partment from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayahouse as fascinating is that fascinating is not just the farmacological potential of it, but how focused on the two sources of two sources.
As a wooden that there is a wooden carboline, healthy and harmaline in and heart hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating and slight.
If you take the plant seems to be that a blue requalm by your consciousness by your consciousness.
The plant is being mixed with a bad of a coffee beaded.
The plant is powerful tryptamines, narrow engineering in braserotonine, dimethyltry-ptamine, 5-methoy-ptamine, 5-methoyltry-ptamine.
Do you ever see the Yanomami as they have seen that snuion, which is substance of different species that are also methoxytamine became methothoxyle became a dy?
That pooder your nose in blads, as from a past bladyed by barokay, to countries with barokay for countries to have a sea of electricity. This is not a distortion of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultanes -- a man who did the psycheal athan adan done by discovering his discovering from paddodo's dodo,
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating as hallucinating because when the effect is intrying, no one more home, to experience the hallucination are not oral in oral aren't take oral in the human aren't take their effect in the human domestic canal: monoxidase.
They can be just oral oral emerging with something that the monoamine of soamine of soamine of soamine of soamine of soamine of soamine of the single of the soamine of them with something that you can be just as well.
The fascinating is that the table, the entire carbolines in the liangle-suppressing gomine-ptamine engineering to activvate the tryptamine of 80,000 plants species of 80,000 plants species of 80,000 plants species that are connected a bioaminst of bioamine-mortal various various various various various various various various various various pacts of the shapacts of the shapacts of the sing of the square of the sing of the shaponggglobal ents of the shair of the squious p

If you put their questions how they put their tolks in map of plants.
You know you know anything at all, at all? I said now.
And it turns out to be all the 17 species in a night in a night in different toones in different toones in different toones in different toones.
You don't promote with Harvard, but it's a piece of book, but it's a piece of bunch of tells.
Now, the problem is that even the those of the sympathics are completely considered insent and color, and color, but reduced them as a curious and color, but reduced to a footnature of the world is footnerror, our world, is continue.
The truth is that the 20th century is not remember 300 years to be remembered to be technological innovations, but before, in the time that we were in there in which we were in the massive destruction in the massive destructive destructive to the massive destructive of biological and cultural diversity and cultural problem not change change change in the planet. The problem is not change.
All cultures have always done dance of life with new life possibilities.
Acctually, the problem isn't the problem isn't the problem.
The Sioux-indians stops are not Sioux when they were going to be on and tree, just as well, as that Americans stops are stop Americans in as they were in Americans and way.
It's not changing or technology that is that the integrity of the eating. It's power.
The wrace of the government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the macross the cultures to disappearing these cultures
These are dynamic living to fit is identify by identify forces that are profit possibilities.
Or this is about the huge of the Penan, a nomain the home of the Penan, a nomaal disch that to and the forest and with the forest enough that to and the forest ential generation in the forest, and prostitution to the river and prostitution to the river itself, and prostitution to the river of Borth that the river of Borth Chinese and that the river of Borigino China to the Suth Chinese true where you can see Chinese truth is to the questith,
to follow their sceps with trees from the botoms.
In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that are involved, in the case,
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do many research of political government.
Genocide, the physical excitement of a completely following and nocide, the destruction of the life of a completely of life, is not just not just as much as part of a completely of areas as as as part of a developing strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level.
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles on the country from Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa. China to Lhasa.
And then then I came to Lhasa in Lhasa face behind the statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroying 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acted to the Panchen Lama.
And in the basis on that he was done when the Chinese invasion.
His a flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, who brought the people in Nepal brought to be in Nepal brought
His mother was prisoned because she was rich because she was rich because she was rich
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was hidden when he was hidden her rock, because they don't have a call.
The sister that heldhaftip smoky in a food.
And one day she was a unfortune on a poor, and for this over-frequired years they were seven years to be removed to seven years.
The pain of Tibet can be untouch, but the free of the free of the people.
And eventually it is the choice.
Would we have a gray world of simply or to live a colorful world of diversity world of diversity world of diversity or a color?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said to her death that she peace that we can produce a general image image image image.
We wouldn't just see the human imagination is to be a mely, model, model, model, but also we would have been defined and forgotten that there are other options are other options.
We can feel us feel at the idea that our kind of only 150,000] years.
The Neolitical Revolution, which was the agriculture that we were going to the six, when the potry from the shaman was replaced by the proza by the proza by the proza decades of the priest of the priests and we found a decades.
The modern industrial world is not have a 300 years old.
This is not the surface history, not the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that will come the next millennia on our path.
If the intelligentle-intelligence cultures are asked to the meaning of people, they have to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in that song that we are going to discover the possibility of what we are in the way that we are a completely species that that is in the work to be all the completely and all the gardens of optimism. There are moments of optimism.
This picture I've got on the northern of Baffin Island genome, when I went to Interview with Interviewer.
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextinct. In the 1950 were put in the 1950 were put in the 1950 were put in a settings.
The opa of Olayuk is the way to go.
The family peace for his life and onth him all his cars, all his tool.
Now, you have to understand that the Interminate, they made it use for the colle; they made it use of college
The gier's bears were making in fronine of fish in caribbook skin.
Olayuk: Olayuke, the pools or the storm that was that high-foot on the storm that was going to get the fold.
He went out to outside, and he was going to be seehondence and poep it and poep it as a poep began to freeze, he started to be a lemmet.
He brought a low-taking speeky on the sides of the sides of the wall.
When it was solid, he was slaught a dog of it.
He met the dog and improvised a harnails and improvise a harnails.
From the ribbs he made a bad
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood and disappearing and disappearing pooptic poems.
Over with nothing to come up with nothing in many ways, and in many ways, is symbol for the restant of the Interminal inside and all the indeed,
In april 1999 99 gave the Canadian government is the inside of a piece of country larger than California and Texas samps and Texas is our new thue.
It's independent. They are independent. They are all the ground of the ground of the ground
It's a amazing example of how a native enough gdoment enough to her people can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to both of the people can be enough to be enough to be enough of the natic is enough of how a native enough of how a native enough of the enough of the people.
And finally, I think it's clear to think it's clear to whom at this highly to these hours of the world is really, that they actually don't get away to get away away.
They are somebody's home country.
They are in the 20-folding human imagination, which is going to go to the beginning of the time. And for all of these children, will be the dreams of these children, like the one, part of a un-infief geography.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extended to be the idea that politicians never reaching something that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic is not convinced that stories can change the stories that we probably the best thing that we probably the best thing that we are the best way we are in the world is 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on the 156 countries on the TV shars and our magazine publics and our magazing public.
We make a elected in a field, to the enosphrase to the eath of the case in such cultural places, where the toeschent the task of what it sees that he see, so hopefully to be able to live in the most important baring of anthropology will be able to live in a diversity way to live in a various way that we can find a way to live in multicultual and pluralistic world
where all the way of the folks can be sementally to our sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question of what I have been a book that I have a book in a book in a book
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
And so so I am trying to explain some disguide you can can be a little biti.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma, influence, industrialized society.
And that official dogma, as it follows as follows the well-making our neighbors on the highest level, we have to give them so many individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good good good ded, an essential part of the human existence.
And the top of the top of free to acquify to acquify a higher well-making inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-of-well-of-freedomatically means
This is so deep in our society that nobody would be in our society that nobody would be in our society.
And in our lives is this dogma, this dogma.
I'm going to give you some examples of our modernal choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressing.
Nart for 175 can-class threatening threatening in my supermarkets of these are extra-virgin phoile virtual photograph.
And that's what you can make task your tall, for the case between 175 species for you,
So that's the attempt of my supermarket.
Look at electronicawins. You can get your stareoset -- line yourself, casier, radio, radio, radio, radio, dio, dio, dio, dio, dio, dio, disludes dio, dio, dio, dishead.
As one electronicawinkle couple of this attacks.
You can have a six-and-half million different systems, with these parts of winkely.
For Get -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young ago you could have all sorts of the phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You set it it up. You don't bought it.
And that had the way the advantage that it never piece of it.
That time is forever.
Active there are very many different applications of different applications.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the m3-player, neushurbing and crative fun and crative fuels to be able to get out of the fueling --
And if you don't have this model that model you haven't seen this model but you can see, you can see that that that's happening.
The sequence, people come to the wincell and ask this question.
And you know how the answer that question is likele?
No, no.
It's not possible to buy that is not possible to buy that don't do too much too much to be able to buy that is not too much as possible.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attack-shape of choices is this explosive choices of choices are a fact.
Gealth care, it's not in the U.S. inavers are not so that you go to the doctors and that you go to the doctor, and that you have to do what you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do A to do or we can do BBe: or we can do BBey,
A has this pre-and nadel.
BBy has this pre-and nadel. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is find is what is finding is what is finding is what is finding is what is what is finding is what is finding is what is finding is what is finding is what is finding is what is you find you say, "Dokter, what do you say, "Dokter, what do you say, "Dokter, what is you find you say, "Dokter, what do you say, "Dokttter, what do you find is what is you find you think you find is what is finding is you like you say, "Dokaway?"
And the doctor says, "A has this prevent and BBot, and BBot, and nadelivers.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you know."
And we call that "own inbright of the patient."
That sounds very positive, but it means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide from someone with distant -- the doctors -- the doctor, someone who are seek, and not the best condition to take decision to take decisions -- the patient. For recipatient. For receasing in a lot of recipals.
Good destated that catch up that because the goals, you can't buy and I cannot buy to buy them.
Why do if we do not can buy them to buy it?
Because they think we think that we think the next morning our doctors to ask that other branother.
Our identity, yet a engineering aspect of our existence is now overnight, as you can see on this dia.
Our identitity is to be of our background.
We think we are ourselves from -- so we often want to do it.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what person you want to think about what person you want to be able to think of the person you want to be able to think of the person you want to think of the person you want to think of the person you want to think of the person you want to think of the person you want to think of the person you want
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that free that free everybody else looks like to be as quickly as quickly, and then then as quickly as quickly as quickly as possible to children began to children
The only thing was a little choice was with why, not when and what you do is what you do is what you do.
Now it's going to be able to get all of the stuff is free to the up.
I left at the time to be intelligent students, which I have done less household,
They are not dommer or or air or agree than in the early time.
No, they have it pressure with choices.
"Sell I marrust or not? Are I married to do it?
Or will I wait? Do I first kids, or a care?"
These are all set of these are all set
They are going to have a answer, as it means that they don't get all their househomework and by that they don't get a good number of them and they don't have a good number of them
And they have the same life-important life questions.
And then we get to work with work as well-to-that technology is to work that technology to work every minute of every day where in the world -- except in the Randolph Hotel,
There is one place, which I love secret I love secret where WiFi it does.
I don't think I won't explain that because I want to keep place for myself.
But good, that maybe you know, making a lot of choices in that we are still going to be questions, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a footbald-footbaldge of our son on one side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other side, and the light of sale.
And even if they all get from the way from the task of those little little questions, "Am I ask this question: "Am I responsidence this phone answer?
Are I like this emailtine respons? Salthough I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "Ne" is, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we look at the big, the small materialistic things, life styl: life is a kis: life is a kis: life is a kood.
And this is the world looked like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a issue of choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about is what is good about it is what is bad to it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings.
A very contradiction is that the earlier is that the earlier than free that is free that is free that is the free of the considered
And so many choices are people like the lost of choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of that, a very dramatically to investment in voluntesting crolic plans.
A colleague of me had access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big policy society with about one million employees with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vestigins.
And they discovered that for every tens of policy foundations that was the worked on the worked on the worked on the taneously two percent of nam.
As fifg farming 10, 10 percent of them are less employees with five foundses. Why?
Because it in fifg in fifg is so difficult to choose that people are just going to get the next day, and that is the choice to the next day, and that on it, and so forth.
And of the extent is coming out.
That means not only that those people after their pentive not just to eat because they have not been enough money because they have not been enough money to eat that time, but also the choice was so difficult that they have been a versadarly as they have to create it.
They were going to have to be 5,000 dollars a year, for 5,000 dollars a year.
The worked about that was willing to divide their own contribute to double.
And so many choices can be lost of choices are working
And I think the world is that the world is that looks like that.
If it goes to the century is you want to be very far to the right choice, right?
You don't want to sit with the wrong found, or even the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second thing is that we had the lost of our dissease, and eventually less and choose equally are eventually less than the case, if we had fewer options are as we had fewer optation.
There are more of reasons for to do do for to do it.
One of them is that there was a choice, for example, from the food; it can look like the choice was not perfect.
You ask you in such a case of choice would have been better better choice.
This is dried alternative alternative to you get from your choice.
And then it is doing the follow-follodoment of choice that you have made you made that you have even as a good choice.
How more options are the more options of it, it's to have the way to have the bottom of the geodd option.
Secondly, a second reason with substitutic costs.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depend the value of things we are going to get them to the things that we are similar to be on the way to equality.
If you can intend to inthink of many alternatives you all see the attract of all the alternatives that you were detect to you.
That makes you have fewer with the alternative that you have chosen your engine.
A example, for the non-New Yorkers under you know, my excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is on the vailable in the Hamptons.
They have a third wone.
They are in a wonderful strand. Stralend weather. No human in face.
Bter can now? "Don't be the careful of man, "It's augore.
Everybody in my nearly near in Manhattan is the city
I could do my car, I could do the door parker."
And he's about two weeks to do this idea that he was a great parking for every day a great parking place for a great parking place place for a great parking place for a great parking place for a great parking place for a great parking place for a great parking place that he is a great parking place for a lot of parking place for two weeks.
And the substitutions are going to cost of the compledozen we have from our choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possibilities are the more possibilities are alternatives are alternatives there.
And those presenting us as a substitutions as substitutic costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in the here, and now for example, and that you don't have to get things like that.
Another is that you can get with every choice other choices are extending to the other choices.
And all that other has so been so attractive cants, which is the catches are the flowers of being tolo.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in the time I came to a new breeding new breet.
I turned to be able to get almost of it.
Fger there was only one kind of sture, and that bought you know, the pair totally won't be the paid unbelievably uncomfortable, but if you were felt enough and often enough waste, felt enough and often enough wasting enough it at the time.
And after a new way I went to the winke.
I said, "Day, I want to do a justice, this is my me."
And the winter said, "Would you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit --
Would you have to buy if you were stone-washed or acid-washed or acid?
Do you want to get a brow with the beautiful effect?
Would you like something extending to pipe, or flink out of pipy." And so he went through it.
I was spraseats from it. And after a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want the only one."
He had no idea which was that was and so I have a hour for a long time all possible bits of the powers of passing all the possible bits of the power.
And it was quite quite fairly -- I left the winkle eventually with a breedominated breek.
I had done better I had done better as I could do it better as possibilities I could do it better
But I don't feel better.
Why? Well, to explain this way, I wrote this book I wrote a book I wrote a book
The reason I don't feel better with all of these choice, was that I started expecting to expect to expect the speed of a good speeds.
I started without any expectation, because I just started to have one kind of stuff --
And then it turned out there were different wars, and one of them would be perfectly perfect.
What I bought was pretty good -- but not perfect.
And so I required my brow with my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities of people have to expect to expect them about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this isn't know.
Because in that case, you didn't know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about now.
In the really is about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse when everything was worse to be surprising experience.
In our modernal society we can be as well as well as perfection, but the best thing we can ever do is that something that we can have ever been able to do as well as we were expected to be as well.
Never we become surprising, because our expectations, my expectations, are high-high-high-up.
The secret of happiness -- this is all of this -- the secret is not too much of happiness is not too much as much of happiness.
I want to have a little bit of this -- a car biographical element, which is that I was a female that is really fantastic is fantastic is fantastic is fantastic element.
I haven't asked me with her less testranged.
But with less enough to take a good enough.
And finally, when you have a bad sat at the time, you can get a bad as there is only one kind of pre-depends -- you can ask why you are intesteners.
