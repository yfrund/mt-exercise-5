Last year I showed these two slides to show that the polling cap, which was the past three million years of the vastated of the U.S. with 40 percent of the United States, with 40 percent percent of the United States, with 40 percent of the day's may.
But this distinction is the nest of this specific problem because it doesn't show the disk of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of this specific problem because it doesn't show the divast the dividing of this specific problem because it doesn't show the dividing of this specific problem because it doesn't show the dividing of this specific problem because it doesn't show the disk.
The ice skap on the North Pole, in a sense of the main the sheart of our global climate system.
It's in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimped in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt in the summer and crimpt
The next slide I show is a accelerating what happens is happening to the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is done is done in red.
Like you see, it out of darkly blue.
That's the answer ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer there.
The so-called ice ice ice ice for five years of older is almost like flowed that from the body.
In 25 years of this is this to this forward this to this for.
And that's a problem because the frozen floors around the Northern Icszea warming of the Northern Icelated woman is frozen frozen frozen frombes that it is death, when it methane.
Consider the amount of definitely in the atmospheric of the atmosphere, that could be double that could double if we divide the section of the atmosphere.
In some undeep deep deep in Alaska sign of methane in the water.
And the last winter was going to be Katey Walter of the University of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a lot of the Universit
Why! She's OK. The question is totally whether we will be that are going to be that we will be that are going to be that we will be be there.
A reason for that, this is this huge warm-warm-heat Greenland from the north of the north of the north.
This is a melectwo-freriver two.
The water volume is the catcher than it is bigger than equivalent than it is bigger than it was a bigger than it is bigger than ever.
This is the Kanger-lussize Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soads because it meless, it's mely, this is the place where it comes into the sea place where it comes in the sea --
These flug apply straight on.
On the other hand, on the South Pole, the South Pole, the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months reporteaching scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance of the negative ice balance of scientists --
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole of the South Pole very quickly, very quickly.
The whole continent to six meters sea soil floor, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice mass ice mass, there are new brand a few years ago, which was still glaciers were still ghs.
40 percent of the world population is getting half of his drinking water of the meless.
In the Andes, this glestar the source of drinking water for this city.
There are more stroms.
But when they disappears are also the drink-water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoial reservoice to the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are going to be there.
This global drew dreamed to a dramatic styer of forest fuels.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen seeing speed.
Four times in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years, in the 75 years.
This pattern is completely unket.
If you look at the bottom from a historic context of what you can see here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 apped every 24 hours.
25 miles in our ocean every day in our oceans, look at the eye area of the Stille area of the Stille of the Stille of the Indian subcontinent, there is a drastic dgettable, there is a drastic dalation of the ocean in the oceans.
The only great cause of the major of warming the Earth, next to deforest deforest, which is the soil of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extincluding together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-coal-coal-coals.
But we see a circle.
These are the coal-carbon which the board of the board was annumber of number of alternatives were proposed in the last years,
There's a political fightter a political fighting in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industry gave industire for 250 million dollars to promote "scaled step of promoting "scree a contradiction of the contradiction of the contradiction of the contradict of the fun
And that picture was doing something to me thinking.
And the guy was the home in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of literally calculator.
You probably the likely in the news of news in the news of the news of the news of the news of the news in the news of the news in the news of the news
This is the one after the biggest dish in America.
This happened to the Kerst.
One of the advertising the support the Kerster was the Kerster was this one.
Video: "Frosty the steength carbon man is a key up.
He's overfluence here in America, and he is growing our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scree with the day of the day
He is paid and estimate and estimate and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from the Virginia from."
The biggest mine mine of the country is the great job of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clearly become a none; Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rees."
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the too.
This is a piece of a piece of one.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change, as we see the climate change,
That's why the reason the way the most important goal is to give a giant major to the major to the light and bring the light and the decline of the value of the steps of truth about steps of truth about the coal.
Fit is, coal is not smaril.
We find that the clean is -- and it still carries -- and it still still liked.
So, you don't worry about climate change.
Let me talk about us.
Video: Schone of the cool, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-phone quote coal-coal-coal-coals.
Fantastic! The machines make pretty a little bit of a bit of a lawys.
But that's the sound of clean coal-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-coal-coal-coal-coals.
In spite the fact that the breaking of the most important causes of the most important causes of the main causes of the Earth, the remarkable thing that you see here.
Look at the time is the clean coal technology of today.
Al Gore: Eventually, the positive alternative with our economic challenges and that on the area of national safeet.
Video: Stem: America wrong in crisis, the national safeet, the national safece crisis.
The red wire is all these things, our dependence of fossil fuel of fossil fuels, like dirty collected oil.
But now there's a new solution to get out of this for example,
And front of America 100 percent clean electricity, within 10 years.
A plan to get America to get America to the work to get a security that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth is getting a safer and the warming of the Earth.
Eventually a solution that respect enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Repower to have a lot of the way.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: I: It's about re-powered energy.
One of the fastest ways to make a final end, to our dependence of old fuel fueling our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
"On 2: Oh, New investments to create jobs.
Vo: Repower America. Time to be realistic to be realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African talkings to be all of the time.
If you want to go far and far together."
We have to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So here I am here are not going to be there at the LHC is the largest scientific experiment, 27 miles in the bunch of the entertainment, 27 miles in the brib.
It has to be the circumstances that were attacked less than a billions of second after the universe started to be 600 million times a second after the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, dy!
This is the machine Genevily understanding of Genevily
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one that I work. It's the called the ATLAS detector -- 44 feet in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter.
Spectation of ATLAS in ATLAS in attacular so you can see the scale.
In 10 seeptember 10, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a partment in the control room in the control room here.
It's a picture of the first particle streel that was all around the way around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September we knew that the machine worked, what is a huge over.
I don't know if this the biggest across this is the biggest of the Internet page and saw that the Internet page out of the business.
That means that we made a cultural as a science a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golden drams.
These behaviors ago, 13 thousand of a thousand of amper worked.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that do because they can do that because they are superago, all the lower temperaturies.
So on min 27, following the space between the stars, that can bear the behaviors of the stars, that can ago.
In one of the connections between nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was a wire wheat was something warmer, and was invented against that 13 thousand of a thousand of ampeering.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons -- and they were about 30 inches -- and they were about 30 inches were moving about 30 inches were moving to be about 30 inches.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did.
We have been repair of them at the time.
Now they're on the way.
Eind map will be the LHC will be intacks.
We're going to put it back and we'll expect to measure it in juni, so we can go further and figure out what the building stroy of the universe.
Now, of course, those are the debate are reincidents the debate of science are research. It's easy to research.
I think it's actually that the fact that it's so hard to go further than the thing that is what the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would did, I would have been doing the decade of his teaching, his teaching his teaching, his teaching to the Michael Farather said, "It's a dangerous for the progress, and that our images of human spirit of science are not going to take our images of science in the nature, that there are no new world's not a new world's re, and that there are no new ging."
Thank you.
I would want to start to ask you to ask to your children at your children at your children at your children at your childhood at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children at your children to start to get to your children at your children at your children at your children's time.
When you discovered how to grab it to grab them and conscious and conscious to the problems of the teaching and hands of space relationship with space relationship and hanging space relationship to the space relationship and hands of space relationship to solve it, and defense to grab them up, and inhaving space to gray it, and then you know, to solve it and conscious, and res of space religious, and really, conscious relationship to solve to solved in space and then then you was doing space to solve to solve to solve to solve to solve to solve to solve to solve to solved in space and then then then then then take it was a lot of space with space and then then then then then then then
Rumtelevision is a very power to understand the world to understand of the world to us.
If a information of inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- with the nice of physical interaction and my fish of Kalanithi -- I started asking to ask me -- what would be able to ask me -- what would be -- if we were a computer to a computer that ancient ancial finger as a kind of digital finger in a plate of digital desolips with the individual information and we can cattackle with the both of information with the near information
and can ordering as we want to ?
This question was so so that we decided to figure out a answer to figure out a answer by building Siftables.
Cort cooperation is a Siftable computer in the size of a cow.
They can be moved with the hand, they can feel together their movement and their movement and they contain a screen and they contain the screen contact of the wireless.
The nuclear understanding is the physical trade of the physical trade of blocks are going to be moved by the grabbed of it.
And the other thing dies are Siftables a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information of digital information.
And that these aid are having a more physical different, are aware of their movement and each other, and even of the way we move them, there are different new and fun interactions of discovering new and interactions of discovering them in the way we move them, there are different new and interactions of their movement and interactions of their movement and fun
I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video of a video of the offices and others and others and others: To plays and others played by the side.
These interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indians next to each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they are surround, they can also this and make it and make it becomes a little bit of nervous careful.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of the interaction of the interaction of a color as it was a liquids of a color as it was a liquid-of.
In this example in this example three Siftables and I can use them to go and use them to a very much in a spot of the good.
If we have threat the threat, we went back to the back.
There are some of the education for the education of education, mainly games with language, mathematics and logic that we want to give people the possibility and the outside of the education of the engineering of the education of the engineering of the education of the education and the outside of the education and the outside of the
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci of a simple computation programmate.
And here we show a game that a cross-cruise and Boggle.
The principle is that you get around a randomly little, and you get out of a lot of the Siftable, and the words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is it very rescue and appears a new series of letters with the contribute possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on excursion to the Media Lab, and I became up to the Media video of them to make it and make a video of it.
They were actually away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people almost no instructions to have instructions to have instructions
Everything you have to say is ""Most of word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the testing one.
That's our youngest ber bate, right?
And it turns out he only the Siftables wold up.
For him were only blocks.
Here is an interactive paintings of painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate it.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that character of the table.
Here he shows the sun emergency here.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good don! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the needle of Siftables and the next next to to each other, and the needle of the carakters with each other,
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to the purch,
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you to the Is a synthesizer and live music and live music that we developed with a sound producing produces like the lead, bass like the lead, bass and drum.
Eential four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use.
These luces can be injected in the fun Siftables are injected so that you can certain the pattern itself in the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a very very Siftable effects of a lot of controll, as a reverb and filter.
They are being sound to a sound and attacked by the offices.
And in the general effects like tempo and volume that are added up the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: We start with a living in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, by a lead.
Now I put the basline.
Video: Design. I add a little bit.
Video: And now I copy the movie on the print of the print so I can affect the effect lived of the effect living to the effect lived on the effect living the effect of the principle of the effect of the print of the print of the print of the print that I can influence.
Video: I can cut it very accelerating the offices of the cancelerating the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter on the bas for the bas for what more expression.
Video: I can repair the pattern as it is play.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise anything that I can improvise and shorter as I want.
In the finally ended the dimms of the volume Siftable to the left Siftable to the left Siftable.
Thank you.
Like, in my passion is going to make new human computer interfaces that are better interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brains and bodys.
And today I had the time to show you one new in this design area, in this design area with some opportunities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought I was a thought I want to talk about is this is just the attage to a whole new generation to a whole new generation to the interacting with digital media, which bring the information of our world as we want.
Thank you very much.
I look at it to you with all of you all of you all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life for a long time I write writing writing that will change will ever change that will change.
And yet there is something happened in my life and careers in my life and career, and career, and I had to re-in-in-re-in-in-re-in-flip own.
And it started a book that I wrote ungs a memoire: "Een, B, Bidden, Been, in," which is very contratradiction to my earlier work around the world and an international existseller seller and an international existseller seller of the world and a international exist.
The consequence is that people now have to go and fortune to me like I do do what I do.
And the thing that -- indeed,
People come to me and ask me and ask the questions that you can't have this succes?
Don't you get to write your whole life will keep write your whole life but never will be a book that people will write for warm to write your whole life will write for warm.
Don't you get there?"
It's been representation, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- I remember that I was a teenaged 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I told that I was written I wanted to be write to be a writer.
People said, "Don't you get succes?
Don't you get to the point for sure that you will go to the such of it in the way?
Don't you get your life on this work without that there will ever be something out there is ever something from that you will ever be able to get to the puin your broken bitter of your broken with your mouth of fail?"
And one thing in that streting.
In the short, my answer to that questions on this "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all of those things that are called all those things that are called called
All right.
But I'm also a lot of other things are afraid and a lot of other things that for all.
For sea wear birth and other things.
But what writing writing about myself the last time that is coming from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is frightened to be working for the work for which they are going to their opinion,
What is so particular about creative processes that we make sure to the effects of the minds' system, something that doesn't happen at the time.
Take my father. He was separtnership, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years that he was asked somebody to have asked somebody to him that he was not afraid for it.
That's how to you say, "Yohn, how do it with your chemist?"
No, it was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been by the centuries by the centuries through the centuries for piece of manically, to be the reputation for piece of manic,
Scircle of the reputation.
Not only writer, other creatures, other creative people have been pretty instable, instable, instable.
Look at the grim of the Grimp of the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
And many died you, often following by own own own perform by own own own liber.
And even those who don't have a suicide for suicide to be under their gave to be under their gave too behold.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "My each of my books is a piece of mitself."
That's pretty much to say about your life-work.
But of this kind of excited we don't look at it.
We all heard the fact that we heard it with the slide of accepted.
The reason the room is that creativity is insultify connected with suffering and that a poor will lead to the end, and that will lead to misery.
So that's why I want to ask everybody here today to be living this idea living the idea of living this idea liv?
Do you think about that?
Because I'm going to think about it, I think it's not a pretty much though, I don't think it very much though.
I think of the weather is what the weather is what I think is what I think about it.
And even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is so that this century is so good.
We can sport a lot better sporks a lot better to live in.
I know sure it would be in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live out of that dark thought.
In fact, the fase that my career is in my career on the board.
Go took me a young, a high-young years.
I can spend four decades to spend four decades.
Heemember will be all the other thing that will be now in the outside of the outside of the outside, as the work that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends of these friends of the ones of the ones of the most likely is probably my greatest success all behind me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think of the things that you know about the morning, you know the morning to the decades to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to work about about the work that I love the work that I love it.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think of the conclusion that I can only go with writing a psychological protection in the process of building in the process in the process of building in the process of building in the process of building in the process of the conclusion of the conclusion that I can only go to the conclusion as I can just go to the conclusion
I have to write the writing a safe distance between mitself and my beliefly to the reactions at the same time, and my performance public.
I was looking at the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in history in the history and deeps me in other civilizations to see or others to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help create creative process.
My quest me has been taken to the old Greeks and Romend.
And you know, it's a long and it's a long and intricated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombs and Rombs were not that creativity of their own own own own --
And they believed that creativity was a godle-mind spirit was a desire to the human beings came across and unknown for fage and unknown reasons.
The Greeks called this calls of creativity mines of creativity "demon."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he was a demon that past words to fluist.
The Rominal idea.
In fact, in them was a guy created creative mind creative spirit is a genius genius
The funny is that the Roman with a genius with a genipiently clear.
In their polar was a genius a kind of magical godal entity that were going to hired in the walls of the ateler of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the atelling of the artist
A little bit like Dobby the house to the house to the house
If the artist was working on the work was on the work was assistance.
And he gave it works.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the distance that I had the psychological protection to the outcome of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work on the work
The artist was so in protection to protection to a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all of the one.
Everybody knew that was a invisible genius had helped to help you have helped it.
Do you crowd your work was not just to you, it's not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty until ones you had a pretty until genius.
Lge time that was the the Western the Western creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed to change everything changed
There was a whole new idea: the individual human is the the resource of the universe and is above all the gods of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacked from the godal world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity is completely from the individual came out of the individual came out.
And for the first time in history was there about artist in history there was a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not have a genius and not have a genius and not the genius were a genius and in the history of the first time in history was a genius and not the first time in the first time and not that they
I have to say that I find a great fror --
To one person, one answer individual individual to believe that he or she is the clear, the essential of the century of all of the evast mystery, of all of the godlaborate -- that's too much responsibility for a fragile human psyche.
All you ask somebody asks the sun in sun.
Egos are building to gigantic proports and there are unfortunate expectations to be copy-prestations to prestations in the way.
And I think this pressed the last 500 years, a lot of artist has made a lot of artist purpose has made a lot of artist
If that is, and I think, and I think, the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a parent back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the human beings and creative mysterio?
Maybe not not a lot of the maybe.
We can have 500 years we can make rational humanisn't undone in a 18 minutes to a 18 minutes far speech.
Probably in the audience people who have reflected scientific doubt about the idea that elowns of the idea that eloder the idea that eloder the work of artist to inspirating artists to inspirating the work of artist to inspirating the idea that else focus on the audience to inspirational front of the idea that elodd of the idea that folks are in the audience in the sense,
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in that I will get to get in the world.
And yet me demand it.
Why not?
Why would we don't think it possible?
The fast as much as well, as much as well, as much of the total calculation of the total cality that are incalculation in the creative process.
Everybody who have something to try to create something -- so in fact, all of the attacks here -- you know, the creative process is not always talked about rational process is not always rational process to rationally rational process to be rational process to create rationally -- and all the attacks.
And that sometimes it feeling in the paranorms.
I have the great American closer to the great American poet Ruth Stone of the American closer to Stone of the major of the great American closer to the great American answer Ruth Stone of the great American animal American answer Ruth Stone of the great American ansoever.
She's writing the nine. Her life already writing them close to write their closes.
She told me about her youth on the Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was felt the work on the work on the work on the bottom, they were a poem over the country.
It was so said she was so much like a big wave air came out of air
And a poem of wave golfing over the country to her --
She felt the ground was to shake her feet started to shake her at that point and it was doing that moment but one thing to do is to be a little bit of the things for her life.
And she ran home, and she had to get the close and she had to do it as possible and then paper and paper and paper to pick out the paper and paper and paper to do it as quickly.
When it came up by her dog was that her only was her only writing her only writing it on the waves.
Sometimes she was not very quickly.
Then and ring and ring them, but it doesn't reach, it doesn't reach.
In these kinds of whether by her him by her him, disappeared by her -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in a different denomins.
And even there were some of the story -- this I find the beautiful part of the story -- they were the close to almost of the poem --
And then she was looking for the paper and paper and paper and paper the close by her one.
Junew at that time she had a pencourage to do it.
And with her other hand, so told me it from the air.
She was taking the close to his tail and it back in her body, and it back in her body, and it wrote it back into her body,
In that cases that cases came up with the close to the pires of paper but then in the end, but then in the end.
When I think that I thought -- what is -- what is happen to my creative process ook!
This is what my creative process isn't a meum!
I'm a mouse of a mouth, which every day on the same time and following and trans with blood, swear and transformed by it,
But even in that daily swrinely swed in that daily had a experience of a experience of a daily did.
You will also know it myself, that feeling that there are creative ideas in your board from a source of a source of the source you can identify impossible to identify the way to identify that you can identify it in your release you can identify it in your relationship from a source of your release you can can i
What is that it for resource?
How can we use it without we get the us?
In a way that is good for us to is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed it for a magazine.
We had it about this.
To is actually a lot of his life life has been shown the shows of the gecket of the gecrafy artist that is trying to get out of all the power to the unconcerned on the unconsider the unconsistable creative impulses in him.
With the years was Tom a little bit more rougher.
One day he in Los Angeles on the favor, and changed the process of radically radically
And as he was so heard about it was a fragmentary of a melodie.
The deciding it, like inspiration that is doing it is ingrabb, crops, cwell-gradual --
It was a great melody and he wanted to fast it and he wanted to fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.

He didn't get in panic, but he didn't stop that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air and he said, "Sorry hear, you can't see that I sit up behind the air, you can't see that I have a sense of the sky?"

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what it can mean and what it means, and the discovering of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point: we were the biology to digital digital issue to the digital code to a new phase to a new phase in the biology with the design and synthesize of life.
So we always try to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think have tried to understand the whole of the phones in different levels of the whole thing that is going to understand in different levels.
We tried different approach, it to bring to minimal minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to digitize the digitizing of digitizing
When we sequence the human genome genome we sequenced the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life to regenerate life of regenerating or can we create new life from this digital universe is we create new life of the digital universe.
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of a kind of that can multiply himself in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get to a nature smaller, genome can come to a nature smaller,
We can go to the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or who's there.
But if we look at the metabolical map, that relatively simple compared to the one.
And it is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can cheat a piece of the things that would be very unlikely that this would be a living cell the cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell the genes that would be a living cell cell the genes
And we decided to be the only route the only route was to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions, to the components to make the components to be able to ask the questions.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started a chromosome syntheses?"
Stay the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, you know, a chromosome "up?
A chromosome is a chromosome of chemical inds of chemical inds of chemical inds of chemical inates material.
So, our tempo of the digitize of digitizing life is acceleration on exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slose of the slose of the genetic code -- but it's a deployment
And our last point it would take a moment in this point on a exponential curve.
We're talking about 15 years ago,
There were some stayed for a bunch of stage for a bio-ethical key ethical key to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in lenging, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make the piece of the more false you make a lot more false you have a lot more false are in the world that makes you get the more fales.
So we had to make a new method for the little pieces and correct the little pieces and correct of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of all the errors of the wrong.
And this was our first attempt, with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the chicks, the chicks, the front
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part started when we stop a piece of chemical chemical chemical straight in the bacteria genetic code gs, and viral particles and virale viral particles and virtually making gics.
The viral particles were going to losed out of the cells, they came back and then the E. coli.
I was until in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they would have to be model but all too well.
They laughing more than you laugh.
And that's why we think this is a situation in which the software can build its own hardware are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we decided to build them in cassettes in cassetts that we could could pull the cassettes --
to understand what the actual components of a living cell.
The design is critical is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than it has to be very accuraat.
When we first assumed this genome in 1995 was the standard of the standard Pror a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually, we found after resequencing 30 pirls -- if we had the original sequence than it was not able to start to start.
In fact, the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are supplenty of the 50 letters to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so much as we have to design design so that they can design design together so that they can go together.
We design unique parts in this way.
Maybe you have read water marks, we stop.
Bet, we have a four-letter genetic code: A, C, G, and T.
Trios of those code for ruwway 20 aminozurs -- that there's a single attention for every aminy oxygen of oxidays,
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though.
And in the and, we just asked ""On the clip.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters and you've got pieces of 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters of the 72,000.
In every stage in every stage we got a overfloor, so we could sequences them because we could sequences a process because we want to create a process that is very robust -- you see you will see stream.
We try to reaching the point of automatish.
So this looks like a basketball final.
Once we come to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow so easy more in E. coli.
That explains the most of the modern tools of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolog combination is used by the biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repairs of the biology to repairs together.
Here is an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans who are three million radiation to can.
That you see in the top panel, set up the top panel, sopm just sopm out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he put it back into each other, and exactly as the first thing was first of all,
There are thousands of organisms that are these around.
These organisms are driefly dry drood.
They can live in a vacuum lives.
I know absolutely sure that there can live in space that can prevent to move to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of it, there is a lot of it,
Here is a debt microph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually made with these processes with these processes with the right design, with the right designs that we did in the right designs that we did in the right design.
And it is it causes it automatic together.
This is not an electron-microscope, this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, genomes about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we spent ungs out of the publication that we speak.
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would presses it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code off the genetic code off the genetic code off the genetic code with a 10-point of point and it would be 142 pages to the pursures with a 10-point letter, and it would be 10,
All right, how do we started chromosome chromosome and do we activit?
And with a virus is clearly very easy to be pretty easy.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated to a bacteria is a lot of complicated
It's also simple to including your eukaryots, like us, you whose we'd be just a different cell and does another in and is what you know as it is what you know as it reading as it reading to the clones.
In the bacteria species of the chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a full transplantation of a full transplantation of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell transplantation of a cell to another other, and can activate it in the cell, and can activity.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micro-size species.
These are about so far from each other, as people and mouse and mous.
We feed some extra gene to take this chromosome of this chromosome selecters.
We have the regular with enzymes to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein the display.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very advanced -- and you will be able to value the cell of the cell.
We just thought he would come to the soil but we tried to develop the process of what we tried to develop the process of what we thought to do is going to go out and further.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We found all kinds of these kinds of chromosome of the second chromosome of third chromosome of thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People who preposing evolution previous in the same same equivalent to not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes are called called DNA restrict DNA to restrict DNA --
The chromosome was not there in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of it, we stopped -- well.
It was express express the other chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome as a strange of material, it was going to finally the cell of chromosome chromosome.
He was blue because he was blue the genes we had stop.
And in very short time disappeared all the characterists of the one species, and he changed in the new species, based on the new software that we stopped in the cell.
All the protein change, the membranes changed -- when we didness the genetic code was changing the genetic code in which it was changed in the way.
This is a major sound as genomician, but we're in the time of the software DNA, to change things fundamental to change fundamental things.
All right, I pay earlier that this is not a creation -- this is a front of the Cambranchored on 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I pay that we may be almost a new version of the Cambrical explosion, which there are great new species on this digital new species on this digital design in this digital design design in this digital design design and designed it in this digital design design
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it need.
We're going to be inside of six-and-half to nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context to put it in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 1946; within 46, that there are four are four.
We have to have food with food, with the care of clean water, medicine, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's going to be a little bit of negged to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collapsed five billion of oil,
That's 100 millions of the hundred of millions of day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than any process than to replace that is going to be a tremendous challenge.
Then there is all of course, all of the carbon the pheads that in the atmosphere.
And by the way, our world we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of diversity coming out of the diversity that is coming out of the diversity that has come out of the diversity that there is focus on the diversity that is coming out of the electronicaindustry from the diversity that has come out of the electronics had only come out of the electronics that has come out of the electronices and then the diversity comes,
We're precedented by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've now techniques now, thesemethods to do so called combined to do combine combination genomics."
We've now got the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day to make a million chromosomes a day
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes or tries to optimes, or tries to optimes, or to produce octon to produce octon the cines, new vaccines, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just standard selection.
We can select select life fatbully, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen map-map-of-design design design software where we actually go to the gang and a new kind of a new kind of on the computer of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design.
We don't know person how it will look like.
We know how their genetic code looks like.
We now fourth of fourth generation fuels.
Unlots of you have seen to ethanol to ethanol experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come out of sugar, like sugar, to more highly high-digit fuels like octan occasion, or different different kinds of butano.
But the only way we think of biology can have great influence without the food price to make the food price is to lay the available to reduce the CO2 as his food supply, and that's why we have to design cells that we do the first generation that we have the first fourth generation of the first generation of the months of the months of the months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but the the world of discovery, we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles deep, about 2.5 miles at calculated temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 and we can take a pipes through pipes through the CO2 to factory fabriess, where that CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time we think of his speak to the basic question, "What is life?"
We have realized you know -- the descene of the piled petrochemical industry to replace the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this, where you can't do this, where you can't do it?
A major energy source become a major of energy source.
But we work on the use of these tools to use these tools to think.
This year, there was the flu -- we always walk just like the facts of the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the teaching of tephased vaccines of the dispot of the teaching of texting.
And here you see how the future can see the evolution is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerators of the synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still far away from the improving people.
Our goal is to assume that we make a chance to survive for a long enough to survive that may be able to do that a chance to do that you might be able to do that you might be able to do that you might be able to survive that we make a chance to do that a chance for a long enough to survive a long, to survive a long,
What I want to show you as a fast. And what I want to show you a new technology that we brought to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surroundation in which you can locally locally with immense amounts of visual data can work.
We look at many gigabytes to digital images and can be able to stay and can keep the stayed and the sorts of our lives, and the sorter and the sorter to our wish and to our wish and to our wish and our lives.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images or images.
Most of the most of this is normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of Congress,
It is all it makes it all because it would be only what the prestations would affect a system on a system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a full book, a full book, a full of non-picture.
This is the graug of Dickens. Every cold cold to a headds.
To evidence that it's really text, and no imagination, and no imagination, we can do something like this is not a picture; this is not a picture; this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a book of reading a book at a book of reading.
I wouldn't be adopted.
This is a realistic example. This is an example. This is a little bit of The Guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of a subject of a subject of the subject.
This is really the fun, and the experience of a real paper paper of a real paper of a crazy medium.
We have done something with the corner of this expensive of The Guardian.
We made a nep advertising of high resolution -- a lot of high than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we brought information
If you want to see the abilities of this car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the treat the limitations of trade through the screen of the screen of the screen of the treat the time.
We hope that this doesn't mean that this means and other flaul -- not needed to be more flaw -- not needed to be more likely -- not needed to be more population.
Of course are a maps a slide of a technology like this, and I will spend a technology like this, I will spend up here to spend a lot of time to this field is a lot of a contribute to this field is a lot of contribute to this field is a lot of a contribute for a technology as well.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and on top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else now.
This is the way, this is now live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which two techniques two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision research by Noah Snavely, promoon, promoting from Washington,
and Rick Srare at Microsoft Research. It's a great collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's possible by Seadragon.
When we do this, you see that, you know, we pultions of the images and the multi-resolution resolution to experiences.
The space shows the space has this meant has this meant has this meant has this meant has this meant has this been here.
The computer vision algorithms have been taken together so they were getting with the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadese Rockies -- where they're genomes. These are elements of the stabilized of these things are space -- and all these things are space -- and all these things are space.
I don't know sure or there is another time there is another environments.
There are a lot of space that are still a lot of space.
I want to be one of Noah's original data Spient data-sets -- and this is from a early protosynthesipic that we worked in this summer -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the reality of this technique of this technique of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the lawyers.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with the pictures from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and campus and campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the circle, and the campus and the campus and the campus and shirts, and you just get you get images of a little bit of the campus and sh
And each of these orange chain a picture that was part of this model was part of this model was part of this model was going to be part of this model that was part of this model that was part of this model that was sharing the model that was part of this model that was part of this model was part of this orange chicks.
And so these are all these Flickr images that are copied in this way space televisible in this way of space --
And we can do a simple way of the simple way to follow the way of nice.
You know, I had never thought I would never work.
It's overwhelming here is so unfortune to be so unfortune here.
I believe you can see that this is a lot of types of the cameras are cameras well, a lot of it, all of the fixes of it, a great number of it,
I'll try to find some strange some strange images
There are so many covered by faces and things like that.
And somewhere between this is actually a series of pictures -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is choiced by the program.
If we have the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is used the data -- from the whole collective memory of the whole collective memory of it looks like anything else to each other.
All these pictures are being emerged together a lot of the parts is a very bigger than the parts.
You have a model that is model that from the whole Earth is state.
So this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it, and the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are provide to be able to get somebody else in the way of cut up.
If somebody would want to clip all of these photographs and their names and their names is going to be agree-Dame is requires with all of that data, and I can use as a access to space, which is using every space, which is using every photographs of crucidenial experience.
And of course, the be-product virtual model of this is an imments of every interesting virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who not only photographions and other applications is def, but also from the collective memory of collective memory is to be a collective memory of this is a memory of this is a memory of this is an imments of this is going to be a lot of the interesting of this is going to be a lot of the interesting of this is interesting of the most interesting of this is going pacimbers of the same thing of this is is is is is is is going to be interesting of this is going to be interesting of the most interesting of the most interesting
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that what makes you can get your software possible on a day, in the next years, all the images that are made by everybody on the world in the world can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this really does do is discovery.
It creates, to your wish wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the data in the images.
And that is being defined exciting when you think of the richchality of semantic information that is available to provide these pictures.
When you look for the web on the web and you have a search in the weber on the webpage on the webpage on the web page of information about what we do image in the image of the image of the image of the image of information about what we do image in the web page of the image of information about what the image of information about what the image in the web page on the web page and the web page of the web page and the text on the web page on the web page on the web page on the way.
What if this image that copaffolds to all your images?
And then the number of semantic connections, and the amount of wealth that comes out of the waste that comes out of the major coming out of the things coming out of the things that comes out of the things that comes out of the things that comes effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleasure of travels of eating enographic research is the possibility to live between those who are not forgetting their past, who are still feel in the wind, the touchest stons, the touched stone in the wind, profiteration of the profits, the provide in the profits, the profiters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still the Milky away or that the myths of Inchest-old myths of Inextent with meaning to the Himalave still hunt your break was still to make your breait still hundred of Dharma, you remembers that we live in the anthropology, the world in we don't know life in the life in absolutely but is not just a model of the reality, but is not just one model of the reality,
the consequence of a fun set approaching choices that made our ancestors of generations ago.
Of course, we all share the same advanced requires of the world. Breng children in the world. Breng children in the world.
We all make inforces through incidence of influence.
And in the deaths of the diaverbly die.
So it can't be surprise that we all of them, dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song and the rhythm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now that is the Penan in the Borneo, or the U.S. or the U.S. or the U.S. or the U.S. or the Kaisut in North Kaisut in North Kenya, the Curser-Kenya, the Carai Brin-Sahara. This is the man of the Dahara. This is the man with the remaining with the maonth or a maonth or a maonth re-helling of Quaknal hells of the aiquire,
Everest, the godinarily mother of the world.
They all us are learning us all we can think different, different, otherwise to be able to think, differently.
If you think about it, you can only give you a lot of it.
Samen the one-cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and to her as the biological life is as important as the biological life web, the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine as you can imagine as an enospers.
The equivalent to the final of the final of all the thoughts of all the thoughts, dreams, mythes, mythes, and inspirations and intuitions and intuitions that are conscious since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etno, the great nalatacy of humanity.
She's the symbol of all of that we can be and all of that we can be as an amazing news and all of that we can be as an amazing animal species.
It's a biosphere is what biosphere is the evast is the evicate, and it's a lot of bigger mate.

This picture I have a picture on the northern point of Baffin Island then taken up with Inextended to be narrow you.
This guy, Olayed my guy, a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadese government is not always been friendly for the Inextinction. In the 1950s, to savest our sout, in the 1950s, to follow.

And this is something called around with nothing to get around with nothing about it, in many ways, is symbol for the weather the resistance of the Inin and all the influences in the world.

It's independent. They remember all the ground. They remember all the ground.
It's a amazing example of how a native enough enough degree to her people can bits.
And finally, I think it's clearly, it is clearly, at least for who is getting to these home of the world is really, that they don't actually get away from the world -- they actually don't get away from the world --
They're somebody else at home country.
They are going to go back to the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids, will be the dream of these kids, just like the uncertainly part of the uncertainly bedded by hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is out of the idea that politicians never reaching anything that politicians never reach.

We make a felt to travel to the enosfer and in the public, with our public, to our public, to the extraordinary cultural pictures so identical exactly by what he seeing so hopefully to live in the anthropology will be able to live in a various way to live in a variety of an operation in a way to live in a multicultiulticultipluralistic world and pluralistic world
which all of the whole wisdom of all of the people, can contributed to our sement.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book that I have won't have a book in a book of the question,
Maybe you see paralls of other sources.
I also try to explain some sense of what I was a little bit of you might have been taken by explained it.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To become exactly to be the official dogma of all the Westery, industrialized societies.
And that official dogma luids as follow-well-of-free-level, the most of our citizens at the highest level, we have to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good dead, an essential part of the human beings of human exist.
And the other thing that is destros us to do to treat a higher prospersal to reach a higher well-well-well-set of thirds.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices love in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more well-well-well-well-of-freedomatic mean automatically means to freedom means of careful.
This is so deep getting a lot of the society that would be able to pull that would be able to pull in our society would be fell in our society that would be fell in our society that would be in our society that would fell in our society that would fell in our society that would fell in our socie
And in our lives is this dogma, this dogma.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice-choice.
This is my supermarket. It's a resources.
Even about dressing of dressing things.
And at the 175 chann-classes are threats there in my supermarket, there are in my supermarkets of extra-virgin oil and twell different balyze.
And you can make a lot of your own threats to make a bunch between those 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked my supermarket.
Look at electronics -- you can get your stereoset -- you can asset your stereoset of it, cassettesple -- cash talk, cassettespe.
And in that one electronicawinkle you can choose from this number of answer and of this number of electronics
You can do a million different systems of cooperiod of these story.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another other example -- communication.
When I was young young ago, you could all kinds of phones services, but only at Ma Bell.
You home it up. You can't bought it.
That was the way that it had never piece of the advantage of the way.
That time is fored.
Today there are lots of different degree of different deals.
And in cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the middle -- with the middle of the massive and cryer and cryer and cryer and cry-balance.
And if you don't have this model in the wincle in the wincle, but you can see there of his seen that that is happening to be inside of his short.
The sequence, people come to the wincle and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible a mobile of buying that doesn't do too much does not too much does.
And in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact of choices are much more important than the attacks.
Gealth care, in the U.S. People average is not that you go to the doctors and that you tell tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and that says, "We can do A to do But, or we can do Be:
Actually, this and, and after sharing this one.
By has this forward and after sharing this one?"
And you say, "Dr, you say, "Dr.
And the doctor says, "A has this forward and Bose has this prevent and Br.
What you want to do?"
And you say, "Dantor if you was me, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own inbright."
That sounds very positive, but in fact, in fact, that the heavy of decision, and the doctor of somebody with all of things -- the doctor -- to a life's deat, somebody who is seek, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient. And in the patient.
Good decade that slaat that ners, because the goal group, you can't buy and me, you can't buy them.
Why reclaim to do if we can't buy it?
Because they think we think of the next morning our doctor our doctor to ask that other brand mean that other branch memories to be able to ask that other mark average age.
Our identity yet a price aspect of our existence, now is overloved on choices like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is losing our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it --
Everybody else morning to the empoint you have to think of what person want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that freeze that freeze everybody out of the way that you could have been able to get so fast as possible and then so quickly, and then as possible to kids so quickly.
The only choice was the only choice was with which, not when and what you do is what you tell it.
Now free everything to do for the opportunity to the way.
I left at particular intelligent students, which I have done by the 20-houswork than than the housing work than early than early housing.
They are not damn a suspect or in the early time in the early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Do I won't be marrie? Is I now marrie?
Or will I wait? Do I would have kids, or a career or a care?"
These are all the way to ask for the world.
They go through to answer them to have an answer to have a single their homework and by that doesn't have their homework and by that doesn't have a good number of catcher stories.
And they have the same thing. They're important living questions.
And then we get to work. Carl just all that technology is going to be able to work every minute of every minute of every day -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love secret I love secret that is doing the WiFi does do.
I don't walk clap to keep the place for myself.
But good, that huge choices at the time of work in that we keep asking us ask and then on the time, or we go to and work, or we are not going to work or not.
We can look at a football of our son, and we can look at our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our laptop on laptop on the other hand.
And even if they're all from the time they are all of the things that are all of the things that are competition with all sorts of questions, "Did I responsing?
Do I response to this emailing writing this letter writing writing this letter writing --
And even if the answer is "Nee" is we experienced the football of our son a very different way.
And what we look at the big, the large, the small, materialistic things, liststyle of issues, is a question of things.
And this is the world used to be there out.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choose choose of choos;
And this is what the world looks like.
The question is now?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is going on.
That tremendous choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings.
It's a very contradiction is that the earlier is that the earlier than living freedom.
And with so many choices are people like the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically a whole dramatically of the research to investments in volunteer pension planns.
A colleague of me had access to investment data of Vanguard, a great policy with about a million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
They found that for every 10 polling to any 10 polling foundation that the worked far two percent of the partner was two percent of the partner of the works.
In five ve froptic foundations than five percent employees than five than five than five founds. Why?
Because it at fifish in fifx, and the clipes so difficult that people would just choice out the next day, and that once and that one, and that on.
And of the exposed to be dealing of the disk.
That means not only that people after their pentive to eat their spot bread, because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money so difficult that they have been so hard to be a versation of their parts for a lot of their own desire.
They were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year, and they go to their nose nose for.
The worked was a lot of willing to double.
And so many choices can be lost of choices work.
And I think the world looks like that looks like this.
If it comes to the century to the century make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be remembering with the wrong foundation, or even the wrong three.
That is the first effect. The second thing that we had to do as we dish the lost of our dismiss and choose the end, ultimately less racious with the result of the result of the result would be when we had been when we had been when we had less.
There are multiple reasons for to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tallowed to be that the choice was not perfectly the choice was not perfect.
You ask in a case, for a different choice would have been better.
This dreamed alternative is that you get spike of your choice.
And it is a break on the followed of the choice that you made it in the choice that you made a good choice choice
The more options there are more options there are too easy to have the spike of the geodd of the geodds.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
And then Gilbert gave all of how often we depend the value of things that we depend the value of things we comparing with them.
If you can think of many alternatives you can incidents, you also see the attractivity of all the alternatives that you define in the end.
That makes you that makes you bad with the alternative that you have chalized it.
One excuses. For the non-New Yorkers under you own.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is a set of valikely in the Hamptons.
They have a third won a second wounds.
They are on a wonderful strand. Stralend weather. It's a human in vision.
Don't be a lot of the gusts of that man, "Move gusts.
Everybody in my near Manhattan is the city of the city of the city
I could carry my car for the door."
And he's sitting there two weeks, with the idea that he was a great parking place that he was a great parking place for a great parking place for a lot of parking place.
And substitutional cost of the people, the full that we have from our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there there are more connected alternatives are there are there.
And those presenting to us as a substitution costs.
Another example.
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in the here, and for example, and that you don't have to get things.
Another point is that you can choice other choice other choice.
And all of that other has so attractive to the cluces, that the chose of the geods.
And then third is the escalation of expectations.
I came to this in my quest to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse to a new greenhouse.
I walk almost always spirit is always play to be able to get
But, there was only one kind of stuff, and that bought you know, the past. The pair totally doesn't believe unbelievably comfortable, but if you the breezing long, and felt enough and often enough enough enough and felt enough enough it was a lot of carrying enough and felt enough it was a lot of the past.
And after years I went to the store for a new.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff, this is my me."
And the wind said, "Would you smart fit, easy fit, easy fit?
Do you or a rhyth? Whilt you would stone-washed or acid-wasnes?
Do you want to closed the slip?
Do you want to pipes, or flink or flink of pipes, and so he went through and so he went through it.
I was there there was a sprapid of it. And after a while, I said, "I want to the only one."
He had no idea what greenhouse that was a hour country, and so I have a hour country's connection to passed all the possible one.
In fact, I would really, I left the winkle eventually ended with a excited breezing breezing greenhouse to a very explored greatenhouse to a extend to a extend to a very explored greenhouse with a very much of it is honest.
I had done better in the time I could do it in the way I could do it better.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? To explaining this to myself, I wrote a book written
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, was that I started expecting to expect of the speed of a good speed's speak of a good spirit of a good spirit of a good spirit of a good job b.
I started without any any expectation because I was a very spirit is a kind of spirit knows --
And then there was different different of there were different and one of them would be perfectly perfectly perfectly in the way.
What I bought was well-well-well-to-perfect.
And so I compared my jobs with my expectations, and that assume teleur.
The more possibilities people have expected to be expected to be more to focus about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less task with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about that I'm talking about it.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was bad was bad at was bad at the time.
Because when everything was bad was bad to the people were able to have a lot of surprising experiences.
In our modern society can we as well-force citizens perfection perfection but the best thing we could ever reached to it, is something so good as well as we expect.
Never we are surprise to be surprise, because our expectations, are torenough, torenged are too high --
The secret of happiness -- this is to you all the secret of happiness is not too much of happiness is not too much expect too much of happiness.
I want to be here -- a car biographic elementally -- I am with a woman who is really fantastic elementally fantastic.
I didn't asked me with her less too.
But with less enough needs a good cants.
And finally, when you get a bad on a bad sit as a bad sat as there is only one kind of predicts of the president of you can ask your instone.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different greents are available to fall, and you buy to fall, and you buy to fall, and you can responsible?
The answer is just so simple that you are so simple to you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greents of these things, you don't have an excuse to fail.
So if people decided to decided to make the results of those decisions are good to be good in the circle of choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clear, clic depression underneath the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of
A factor -- not the engine, but a significant factor in this explosive explosive and self-order to this explode and self-order to have a lot of expecting their high expectancy expectincluding experiences are very high expectations.
And when they try to explain the teleuration for themselves to explain themselves the death, they give themselves the ded.
The nettoress, is that we spoke on it, but our objective on it, but our bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of it.
As a together a contained together a contained for a minute.
This is the official dogma, that is by everybody to where is adapting it.
But that's not not not to do it.
It doesn't hit doesn't choose to choose better than not can choose better than not cannot choose that is more choice, but it doesn't automatically better choice.
There's a magical grounds. Well the choices. And I don't know.
But I know we are all the time we are for a long time that are choices us are being choices of our well-well-well-well-well-well-being being a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time we have been a long time.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best one.
The choices in competition of industrialized countries comes out of material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we heard about before, where the problem is not so much choice is too much choice is too much choice is too little choice choice is not a little choice choice is not a lot of choice,
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that for the moderne, well-well-foot West.
That's frustrated, and it's all the time you would have yesterday you yesterday told you that expensive and sit is not helping your kids are not helping your money. Suncelerate.
I say the same thing about this dure, intricate choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to be a little bit of the focus to do it.
They make our lives less value.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all of those choices were overbehaviors to have been overbehaviors to have a lot of those people are going to prevent the life of those people are going to prevent all of those people on it.
And in fact, our lives would go on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better from reversation of well-freedom, not only poor people -- and that comes through the choices we with our behaviors that we have to behavior that we have to behavior.
And finally, if you read this picture of the sculpture like developed human as a developed of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the things like a developed of this picture, you know,
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scree example, a short global image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought, the longer I understood better I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there is this on the hand: If you fish the fish to create the fish to create opportunities, you have no freedom, but lower load.
If you get the fish to create the fish to create opportunities, you get less too, you get less too.
It leads to more lose and less tears and less ractionity.
Everybody has a fish.
This is a definitely definitely to the fish, but certainly for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the desires of a figures is asking to the questions to ask and associated to the misery, under under it.
Thank you for your attention.
