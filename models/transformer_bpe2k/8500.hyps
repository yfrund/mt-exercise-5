And I was a year I showed this two dia's slip, that the pool, who the pool, who had the last three million years of the fastly of the fastly of the VSS, with 40-40 percent croms.
But this is actually the erns of this particular problem because it doesn't the disappearing the disappearing the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the disappeace.
The ice is the North Poill is in a sequence of our global climate system.
It is in the winter and crimpt in the six.
The next dia that I shows that I shows is a version of what the last 25 years.
And the permanently adapted in the room.
As you see, it from dark to dark blue.
That's the year of the deaths of the winter.
And the crimpt in the somer.
The shaped permanent, five years or five years or older, is almost like blood is soils out of the body is so.
In 25 years is the one of this to this to this is the one of this to this is the one of 25 years.
And that's a problem because the confors of the North IJessea ssea black of the North front of front of woman is front of woman is dealth of wom.
And the total amount of the total amount of the atmosphere's the atmosphere, that could be able to display as we reflect the engine.
In some indiepe in Alaska religious meths in the water.
And then then the purpose Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska different team to another ondiep in another ondiep more.
Whoo! She's OK. The question is a question or we will be able to be able to be that will be there.
A reason for there, is that this huge mberttbron" Greenland from the north of the north.
This is a smell two-diver.
The water volume is echer than a high greater than it is a grout.
This is the Kangery lussuain South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea single style because the lands is the place where it is the place where it in the sea.
These stroming these are fluence.
And then the other side of the planet on the South Pole, becomes the biggest smassion.
And the maand rapped major of scientists that the continent now a negative ice sbalance.
More specific, it's the ice of the South Pool is very quickly square very quickly sown, and name is a single name of water-water-a-a-a-water-a-water-eil-difficult pool of wateras.
The whole continent to six meter seespeace seespearing for six meet as Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the on two after two after two after two after two years ago, there are new mers, which a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population is the help of his dreinquares of that smell in the front of the world's dressing water from the world's dreinquate.
In the Andes, is this glester the bron of dreinquaring water for this city.
There are more stroys.
But when they disappearing whate, the dreink water.
In California was a display of 40 percent in the snow of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes terrify in the water reservice.
And like you could read the progress, the predict stigation.
This is the dreamong of the dreamong to a behaviors of bosws.
And the number of course, the number of course, the world is considered and never seen a incredible and never seen a quare.
Four times in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at a historic context of a historical context than you can see what happened.
In the last five years, we have 70 million ton CO2 to CO2 avil --
25 miles and ton every day in every day in our oceans, Keat the eye of the United Stillic Oce-foot free of the Indian subcontinent, there is a behavior in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean.
The only big causes of the remajor of the Earth, is the sown, that for 20 percent of fossil fuels, it's branching the source of fossil fuels.
Oh, a problem, and step, and steenge is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest extincluding up with China.
And there was a proposed to build a lot more city-carbon centrales of building a lot more city.
But we see a engineing of it.
These are the cities of carbon the bitch of the bitches that was the depend of the past years.
There is a political streezing the gars in our country.
The cities of carbon -- and oil that was gave 250 million dollars to promove 250 million dollars to promotion, which is a consider.
And that picture of me to do something thinking about that.
And the guys was the churse in Tennessea, about four billion literally croched birth of cool,
You probably see the news in the news of the news of the news of the news.
This is the one after one after one after one after the largest fally.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising of the susupport comic conversation of the Cerst was the Kerst was the Kerst was the Cost was the Cost of the Cost was the Cerst was the Cerst of the adversation of the adversal consion.
Video: ""crosty the city-carbon bone, a stage ched cheat.
It's survival away here in America, and he care in America, and he care growth.
Frosty the cities is the day is becoming the day becomes a day.
It's paid and well-scattack-craped and work."
And here is a large particular particular in West Virginia day.
The largest most most most of the country, the great biggest of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blanguguguage -- "Let me duce Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reassi, they don't know where they know what they talk about it.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimath protection two campaigns on your your your your chicically.
This is a piece of a piece of a them.
And the climate COLwory, we see the climate change, as a serious dreamount of our consider to our things.
That's why the reason why the reason is the way to us is a gigantic behaviors to reach the light of the light and the consider of value carbon the light of value carbon the light.
Feit is, step, is not smart.
We think it's shaped -- and it is a little bit more disapped.
So, you don't make a climate change.
And let that but about us to government
Video: Acteur: Schone city, you have a lot about it.
So let's look at this hypermodern this hypermodern cools of cools of cools
Fantastic! The machines make the machines are very much more disapped.
But that's the sound of scene cools technology.
Of the fact that the fact that the front of the most important ways, one of the most important ways, the major or the earth of the Earth, the major cools that you see here is all the way.
Look look at the scene cools of today.
Al Gore: Einally, the positive alternative alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: Stem: America sells in crisis, the economy, the economy, the climate crisis.
The rock is the rock is our dependence of fossil shaps, like villic collaps, like follows and search.
But now there's a during new solution to disappearing to this.
Fore America of 100 percent scene celetricity, within 10 years.
A plan to America to work to work on the work to work to work and the operation and the opportunity of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth
And in the solution of solve that enough is to solve our problems to solve our problems.
Repower America. Our took the so.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about America to give America to the America to give America.
One of the quickly, to make a end, to make a endurity of old squarity to help our planet,
Man: Here's the future of the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: Nieuwe investments to create good better.
Stem: Repower America. Tike to realistic.
Al Gore: There is a old African an-spokings, "If you want to be squickly --
If you want to go to far up with it.
We need to go and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Forig year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I believe that back to a update about how that machine works.
So here I am now. For degenes that there is the LHC is the biggest science experiment ever ever ended to engine, 27 kilometers in enombic.
It has to the environmental considered by a billions that were less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, ds!
This is the machine, the machine.
We took photographs of that left in the detectors in detectors where I work. It's called the ATLASSShe detector -- 44 meter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLASSD. in the scale.
And at 10 september last year we put the machine for the machine for the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the machine.
This picture was called ATLAS.
And that care the facest in the controlllabor.
It's a picture of the first particle that the first particle that helped the LHC ging, and with a set botest with a piece of the LHC, by the detector in the detector in the detect of the detect straight and the the detect of the the LHC,
And in the other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September the machine work, what a huge government is a huge governing.
I don't know if this the largest across the largest across and saw that the Internet page and saw that the Internet page of things like this.
And that means we have a cultural as a cultural as a scientific impact that we made a science impact with a culture.
And a week later we had a problem with the machine, what had to do with this golden behavior.
And they were a thousand thousand camps when the machine on the machine on the machine in the entire power to the machine.
The engineers under you will say, "Not value.
They can do because they are superidend to be on very low-temperaturs.
So on 271 grass, colder than the space between the stars, that can bebehavior.
In one of the construction between the needs of the needs of the nets in the LHC, sat a construction.
And then it was turns out that was something bline, and there was electrical wealthousand camps.
This was the result.
This is another inpressive as you realizing if you realizing that magnets more than 20 ton the hundred of the magnets were about 30 centimeter and about 30 centimeter
We civide about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of stories, what we did we do.
We all divel as they all divice.
Now they are back to wear up on wead.
Eind will be the LHC again, the LHC against the LHC again.
We will be able to get it and we expect to the juni or right or now, so we can go to the challenge of the universe.
Well, of course, of course, that have inslucks, the debate of science the value of science to consider.
I think it's so hard that the fact that it is so hard to be more difficult than the LHC.
I shows the last words on the English scientists to the last words of the world's deast-considered experiments of the value of the value of his lives, this is so dangerous explaining the progresment of the human progress of human considered to the human considered that our imagineering to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a new mysterions of our imaimagineering new myth, and not the degrees are not not not not not not the new myth, to be a new mystersterstersterstersterions of course that we we we we we we we we we we we have have have have have have have have have have a new mymymymymyselfself, in the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last
Thank you very much.
I would like to ask you to ask to ask your children at your children at your children when you play with blocks.
And then then you discovered how to get to graduate and conscious and conscious to the teaching and the consider to the engineering and hanging the considers.
Rimician insight is a strong because with the world to understand us to understand us.
If an information is inspired by the nature of physical interaction with objects -- samand with the objects -- and my advisorder Jeed-SKalanian -- I started to asking me to ask me -- what we would use a computer -- what if we could use a computer that we could use a computer that we can be able to a singer-front of the charge that individuce in the city of the divividuce that we can re-fluence the conconnect constate with the information with the information with the information with the information with the way way way to information with the information and then we have information that we have have to do thing that the way that the clustrstrstrstrstrstrstrstrstricky the cy the cy the crororor r r r r
and can ordering ordering like we want to do it?
These question that we decided us so so so we decided to search a answer of Siftables.
Cort together is a Siftable to a interactive computer size a cooky.
They can be able to the hand they can be able to detect each other detect and they get a screen and they are a scree and turns out and turns out and they are contact.
The nuclear pricice, the physical treatment, just like blocks like blocks like blocks to the gravith to graduate it.
And the way of Siftables a example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information of digital information in digital information of digital information
And that these hulply aid id a more physical differences and the other other movement, and and each of the way we are them, there there are different new and other new and other new leaving interactions.
I started with some simple of simplicits.
This Sifttable is instituted to tell a video to tell us to tell you to play and others and otherset it to plays.
These interactive portraping of portraps.
Indians are each other, they will be able to each other.
If they are ringly, they become this and can be single some single so.
And they feel they feel movement.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting population of the interesting of these interaction, the use of the interaction, as it was like it was a fluence, like it was a low-like like a low-like a fluluistop.
In this example of three Siftables and can I make them to be able to go to a color in a single of the color in a single of the forest of the engineering of the forward.
If we have dressed to the back.
There are some crapid of capability for the education of education, mathematics and logics and logics that we want to give the possibility things that we want to give the possibility to see the possibility to see the possibility of the possibility to see the same thing.
And here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci by a simple requipment.
So here we show a game is a criticing between Scrable and Boggle.
The principle is that you in every single literally gets in every Siftable, and feel the words are controlled in a wordly book in a wordbook.
After about 30 seconds is the very rescue, and different, and different, a new series of possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I am in the Media Lab, and I am a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of these access is that people needed to be almost not needed instructions of the most not needed instructions of the most interesting things of the most interesting things of the most interesting things.
Everything you have to say "Mo's word" and they know exactly what they need to do.
And here are some other people to the tests.
That's our both biggest birth bytest birth.
And it seems that he was just the Siftables well.
And for him that was just blocks.
Here's an interactive painted a interaction to a interaction,
We wanted to be a platform for the teaching of language.
This is Felix that demonstrent.
He can bring new carakters in the scene of the Siftable with that craped the crows.
And here he shows the son the sun-up up the sun-up up the sun.
Video: The son comes up up in it.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene built.
Video: The orange tractor.
God, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by the scue of Siftables and the narracters can respond to each other, and the nature -- Video: Worl --
DM: and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a open end of a open end of a open end of a open end.
and he decided how it is astraight and he decided.
Video: The cat the air.
DM: The last example that I will show you today today is a synthesizer and live music child's development, where every Siftables a sound product like the lead, bass and pressure the bass and pressure of the bass and presses.
Eengineering four different variatis, where you can see what you want to use a different variative to use a different variative variative to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a different variatis, which you can be able to be able to be able to use different variatiatiative variatiations,
These sounds can be injected in Siftables are injected so you can certain itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the air Siftable effects of a likely effects like reverb effects like reverb and move mofeet and filter.
They become a sound to a sound and attacked by the changed to cancy.
And the general effects like tempo and evolume that are progressive on the consider pattern on the whole pattern of pattern
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We started with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, by a extra lead.
Now I place the basline line.
Video: Now DM: Now I feel what I was working on the time.
Video: And now I copple the filter of the filter on the drums, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can it very quickly by the changing of the tempo blocks.
Video: Now, DM: now now now I care for what more expression.
Video: I can rescious, I can rescious.
So I don't need to be able to planns, but I can improvision, it can make a very longer and short a little bit of the point of it.
And in the animal of the dimberate of the volume of the volume of the volume to be able to slight.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion to make a passion from to the new peop-computer interfaces that are better interfaces that our brain and body works and body works.
And today I had to show you one new election in this design design is a new election in this design design that we have to develop the developing of the developing of the developing in the lab.
The dad I want to bring about this is that this only is the attace to a very new generation of the interacting with digital media, that the information of the information of our world as we want to our world.
I dance you from hard.
I look at out to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you all of you to talk to you all of you to talk to you all of you to talk to you with you to talk to to you to talk to to you to talk to to to talk to to you all of them.
I'm writing.
And I know what is my work, but so much more than that.
My life in my life in a long life and I think that I don't think that that will ever change that will ever change that will ever change it.
And then there is a little bit of the things happened in my life and career and career and career to my work on and career to see my work to see.
It started with a book that I had unlived in a memoire: "Ex, Biddly, Biddle -- Biddle that very in the world in the world and international work the world and international exist.
And the sequence is that people in the way and always felt to me as well.
And so that -- you meet dod!
People come to me and questions to me and questions that you don't know this success that you can never be able to eat me that you can never easy this succes?
You don't know that you don't know your whole life will be able to write a book more than a book more than a book that people will be able to get to critics that people will be able to write a lot of the life will never be able to written a book in the life will be a book more than a book of the write that people will never be a book a book in
You don't know that bang for?"
Erunning strong, you know, you know.
Well, of course, that would be very very -- I remember that I was remember 20 years ago, when a tienter, when I was told that I wanted to be write to be write to be write that I wanted to be writer --
People said, "Ben you don't know that you don't get succes?
You don't know bang for education, that you don't have a single of going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a big.
You don't know that you don't know your life on this work on this work without there, and that you will ever be able to be able to be able to the puin of your building bitters, you know, solid?"
Exything in that that streaming.
In the short comes my answer to this questions on this this: "Yeah.
Yeah, I am am for all these things that are enough that are enough to be able to be a little things.
Althen,
But I am also a lot of other things bang, you want to know where everything for all of other things that everything for all of other things.
For example, for example, and other one things.
But what I mean, write the last time I asked myself to the last time that angle today.
Is it rational e?
Is it logical that somebody is getting a big, to be able to work for their human being?
What is so for creative processes that we make us to create the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects of work in other species of work in other species of the things in other.
And then my father. He was a scale engineering engineering and I can not remember that in the 40 years, he was ever ever worked on him to him that was a job.
And so from "Yeahn, how is it with your chemically, how to you chemicy?"
No, so it was not about it.
To beyond to be, scope engineers have been seeing by the century ha also not the reputation of stuff for study mid to be done to be disappeace.
Schey, which have a kind of reputation.
Not just written the reputable people have been able to be able to be able to be able to be very instable.
Look at the grimmit is the grimming in the most magnife creative gests of the 20th century.
And I think are stipped young, often by their own across the own across of it.
And even desting that not the self-ord place to be such their gave to be swear.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Me: "Math every single of my books,
That's what to say about what to say about your life.
But of this kind of exciting that we don't look at it.
We all heard the first of the first and have heard the things and have been accepted and accepted the time.
The universal daad is that creativity is that creativity insent to the list and that a poor pointed stening to read to read to read to read to cell engine.
So I want to ask everybody here today question to ask everybody here is liv?
Do you think OK?
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I think I don't think about it is not a pretty daught of the daught --
I think it is weapping.
And even even though of dangerous.
I don't like this this century also as gard.
We can creative gests a lot better better than a better than a lot better than it.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark to live in that dark to live in the dark of life.
She sectoring the fase in which my career now.
Go now, I am another one one of you, amper seartive.
I can even four decades.
And the probably probably will be all the way I now now now now the outside the outside of the outside of the outside of that extraordinary book.
We are here with the ones of each other, so I can sell: hope it is probably the slips, my grandgest success,
Yeah, what a idea!
If you think that is thinking about it is the morning, you know, the morning, you know, the drank.
So I don't want to be not.
I love me to be able to work that work I love the work I love the work I love in the work I love a work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after a long time I think I am to conclusion that I can just just a psychological protection as I think that I can protect a process in the process ins.
I have to create the write of the dead destate between mitself, and my survive and my survival angst of the reactions,
I have the last year to ways to ways to ways to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of the history and have a deep and deep me in other civilizations to see or others to be able to help a better way to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search a so-old Green the old Green and Romens.
And I don't have a long and including and including a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greiess, and Romenen's old people that creativity was deality of honest.
And I believed that creativity was a godnment was a godnment of a godnments to the human beings and inquicians.
The Grunning this decisions of creativity called creativity "Do the demon.
And the one of Socrates a demoon that he had a demoon that was influistered the words influist.
The Romenen's Romen's kind of the Romomban as as a species.
And we have to them, you know, creative creative creative to a geni."
The funny is that the Romeneny with a geny person with a genion.
In their policy was a genian of magic god-magic god-edition that was in the murs of the poorly of the arst.
A little bit like Dobs the housesed.
If the artists was going to work was the geniassist-assist-assist-assist-assist-assist-assist-assistention.
And the sultic gave to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the dead that I had the first of had, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work in his work in his work
The poor point was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you don't have work to be able to be able to be able to the eer.
Everybody knew that a invisible gence you had seen affected to your mind in the so.
Well you work on your work -- you know, I was not just to you,
Everybody knew that you had a non-independed gence.
Lange time is that the Wests creativity was proted.
And then the Renaissance, and everything was changed.
There is a very new idea: the individual human being: the individual human point and the average of the universe and mysteries.
And a space for mystical weather of mystical weather,
That was the beginning of the rational humanized of the rational humanized
People believity that creativity was completely from the individual found.
And for the first thing in history was there about artists were talking about artists and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I think a great front of a great front of the wrong --
And to one person, one person, one single individual is that he or they have the source is the sourcy, the source of the century mystery, of all the way of the devicice, creative and the knowledge of a fragic human psychchchal human human human human psychcha.
And if you ask the son in the sun.
Egos become read to gigantic provided to gigantic proviviolence to expect expecially expect to expect of expectations.
And I think this pressure the last 500 years, the last 500 years,
If that is, and I think is the question is, "What do is the question is, "What do is now?"
Can we do this different do?
Can we go back to a old back, a old relationship of the relationship between the human being?
You don't think of it might not be able to that.
We can make 500 years we can rational five to rational homban in a 18 minutes to the 18 minutes of garizing spent to a 18 minutes
And probably the audience in the audience of scientific people who are felt about the idea that fightoms with what the idea that front of the work of arest working on the work of artists to inspiring high-high-high-high-garar-food.
It seems me that I will be in there,
And I ask it to me out.
Why don't don't don't do it?
Why would we have that thought, I think, "Why would we have done that I would we do that this?
It is just so much hundred as many high as all the other eless, as much more uncraped in creative process.
Everybody who has to create something has to create -- so in fact, and so in fact, that creative process -- that creative process is not always rational process --
And that sometimes it almost paranormaly,
I've been unsolid the great American dichters, Ruth Stone of the amazing.
And they are dealing in the nine. Her entire life in the gentic did.
She told me about her yourself on the plattace of Virginia.
Some of the felt was on the felt was a slip, they heard a diverse of the country.
And it was so she said, if there was a great golf air.
And it was diverse wave than the country to her across the country to her across the country to her across the country to her act.
And they feel that the ground under her food, and they were in that moment and knew that when it was to do in that when it was going to be able to life.
They were running to home, backward, and they had to get as quickly as quickly as quickly and see it as quicks.
When it was disease by her hund her hund was that her only chance to write it to write it on the slips.
Sometimes they didn't square enough.
And then then ring and ring sing, but calculator.
And in this is a little moments the diverse of her him, in the field -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another disappeared --
And I was a then, there was a thing, I think this is beautiful part of the story -- they were almost almost mist.
And then she was search in house and paper and paper and paper, and shaped it by her him.
Juilian that moment she had a potly.
And with her other hand, so she was told me shed the air in the air.
And they were pull it up to his star and then it back in her body while it back in her body while it was a slow.
In those cases that came out the considered in the sense of paper in the paper in the paper followed follows.
And then I heard that -- what I thought -- what I was thinking about this creative process my creative process to creative process.
And I worked my creative process of creative proces! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse of a mouse of the same time, every day in the same time, and slows, and transformed and it goes, and transforming and it gets and the bear.
But even in that day-swrong of this experience of experience.
You will also know it is a lot of creative ideas in your oprelative ideas in your rester that you can identify.
What is that they do it for bron?
How can we use it without that we word?
And in a way that we do it?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is a mouth of Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a while I was a while
We had it.
To to be in fact, a great part of his life life the toonce of his life is the toonce of the major that are trying to get to the insequence that are going to be able creative impulsoils that in him of the creative impulso.
And I was a little bit of the year of the years.
And in the day he was in Los Angeles in Los Angeles -- and changed the process of the process of the process of the process of the front of the speak of the spart of the speak of the speas;
And then when he heard there, he heard a fragmentous of a melodie.
The decided is the universe, like inspiration that is the death, inspiration -- crap, cally.
It was a beautiful melos and he wanted to fashion and he wanted to fashion.
But it doesn't go to it.
He had no paper on the paper at a tperecorder to see a tperecor.
The very very existing spannment after the sage of the univers: "I got the melos that copy education.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it not."
He didn't get a chter in panick, but he stood that whole mental process and did something news.
He looked at the air, and he looked at the air, and said, "Sorry you don't see that I heard it sight?"
"Do you really know that I now can really write a lod?

June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to start to a new point, we were the biology on the digitalizing to the digital code to a new physical code to a new physical code in biology and synthetissue to the designs of life.
So we always tried to be trying to ask the big question.
"What's life?" is something that I think what a lot of biolos have to different level,
We tried to get different approaches to less imal components.
We are almost 20 years.
When we went out the human genome sequencenced, the analoge world of the analoge world of the biology, to the digital world.
Now we try to ask life is, we can we live in the way we create life to create this digital universe of this digital univers?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genitalium, with the color.
And we tried to look like we we try to look at a nature so.
We can be in the order of hundred genes of the 500 or so on,
But if we look at the metabolic map, that's relative simplicity is relative simplicity with the unso.
Geless, this is simply simplicity.
But when we look at all the genes we can see a piece of shape, it's very unliving, it would be a living cell that this would be a living cell to the cell of the genes.
We decided to the only route to provide this was to synthesis: this chromosphere.
And so we started asking questions like "Can we started to ask a chromospher?"
Stage the chemistry it to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And if we do, we can do that, a chromosphere?
A chromosphere, is a chemically, but a piece of chemically, a chemically.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is destrainy on exponential evidence.
Our mostly to write the genetic code of losing slow-slow-slow-a-slow-slow-slow-slow-slow-a-slow-slowed set of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the
And our last point in this moment in this moment in this moment in a exponential curve.
We are more than 15 years ago.
There were a number of city for a couple of city to a bio-ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical
But it turns out the synthesis of the synthese.
There are thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA making to 50 lits in lengths in lengths in the world that we make it piece of the piece of parents.
So we had to make a new method for the conditions and the correct of all the front of all follows.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little four rus that bacteria disappead.
We designed the pieces of the stuck of the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 liters.
And the spanning part of the things that we put a chemical straining in the bacteria stant of the genetic code of the genetions and virale particles and virale scenes and virale particles and virale sharing and vironments of gars.
The virale particles were the cells, when they were losing out of the cells, and they were back and doodly the E. coli.
I was unlanguage in the oil industry, and I said they said they were model to be a model of it.
They laught more than you lot.
And so we think this is a situation that this is the software are are own hearth in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot of griculture.
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosphere.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttch in the size of viruss, so we could experience the cassetttes --
to understand what the death, we are the cell components of a living cell of a lives.
The design is critical critically, and if you start to digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer that are very accustact.
When we first first this genome to the first of this genome was the standard-precision one front of a 10,000 ases.
And we could be able to disequencing 30 front of 30 front of sequences the war sequences that was not in the way.
And the third of the design of pieces that 50 letters that are 50 letters that have to consider the other pieces of 50 letters to be so that we need to build so they have to build so they can be able to design so they can be able to do so on.
We design in the parts of these things in the parts of these things in the parts of the parts in the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts in the parts of the parts in the parts in the faces.
Maybe you might have watermarks, we stop watermers.
Bedit: we have a four literal genetic code: A, Gree and T.
Trios of those litters for the running 20 aminozurs -- that there is a simple attraction for each aminoxygen ououth of the soxyoxygen ouout.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words,
And in the ancestore of we just just just to be a mouse.
Some of the teleurged that there were no disapped.
We have these pieces of these stuck that we can get them to eat them.
There are some of these they are reparents and in each other.
And we started to make pieces of these these sunch pieces that five to 7,000 letters to 7,000 feet, and then they have a lot of 24,000 letter, and then you have 24,000 letter, to 7,000 feet of 240.
In each city crazzzzero-flowed so we could sequences them because we want to create a process -- that will be very robust -- that you will be very rob.
We try to do it from automatically, to get the point of automatical.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And so we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 agrees -- more than 100,000 ases -- they don't easily more in E.
And that is the exercise of all modern modern the modern biology.
And we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-recombinati," which is used by biology the biology to reparently the biology to reparents.
Here's an example of it.
There is a organized called Deinoccus radio diodurance that three million radiation to radiation in the can.
And that you see in the fitest paneal, sheat the top of chromosphere.
12 ods 24 hours later he was a hours of the one, the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of it.
There are thousands of organizing organisms that are.
These organizing these organizes can be disapped.
They can live in a vacum.
I know absolutely that there is life in space that can be able to exist, a new aquatically engineering engineering environment,
NASA has been able to see that there is a lot of course, there is a lot of it.
So here is a definal microp-photograph of the molecule that we have this processing -- fact with the right designer of the stuck design.
And then you know, they can add automatically, it cartomaticically,
This is not electron-microscoped photo; this is a microscope.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audience, we were insent unlanguage.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule molecule of people, with a duality of the structure.
The molecuge-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would describe with a 10-point letter, without speaking on a 142 page of a 142 page of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the degree of the genetic code with a 10-point point of the point of the w-points of the genetic point of
Good how do we started, a chromospher? How do we have to it?
And a four rus is the clearly soddly easy.
And a bacteria is the much complicity.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryodyodyodyodyodyo, and that's what you know the celkers and that's what you know as the clons.
And in the bacterious species is the chromosphere, but we have integrated in the cell of a death, we can see a full transplaboration of a chromospling to a chromosphere.
We have a chromosphere's chromosphere's a micromosed species.
These are about so far as far as people and mics.
We foot what extra genes so we could sell this chromospher.
We have the conted, with enzyming all the egs of the egars.
It was woman was sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will the very evanced imagining that -- the new chromosphere.
We even thought he would even think he would come to sat the process of the process of the process of developing out of the process of the process of it.
This is a essential evolution mechanism.
We all over the chromosphers that a second chromosphere's the chromosphers or a third thousands of the perforforward species.
People that evolution is evolved to be a lot of biology to be a lot of biology biology --
There are enzyming that restricti-enzyms,
It was chromospheric that in the cell was not easy there.
The cell -- the chromosphere, we stop in the chromosphere.
It was expressive, and the reknowledge the other chromospheric as strange as a strange material, and we had the cell with the new chromosphere.
He was blue from the genes that we had stop the genes we had straind.
And in very short time to be dwents all the carakists of the species, and changed species of the new species of the new software that we had stop in the cell we had stop in the cell we had strong.
All protes changes, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was exactly changed.
This is a sounds like genomics like genomic, but we are in the state, by changes, DNA, to change things fundamental to change things.
Good that this is a little bit of the Camic explosion, this is a shearing -- this is the front of 3.5 billion years, and I paid that we have almost a new version of the Camban explosion, where there are a new species of the Cambigical explosion, affected on this digital design in this digital design is in the majourney of the Cambrital new species of the Camiculture,
Why would you do?
I think it's pretty much as a clearly as you can look at what there is going to be a little bit of it.
We're going to invitial ses-half to 9-half to 9, to 9, the next 40 years.
In my context in my context of the context in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet...
for each of us that in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, in 40 years,
We have to food with food food of scening water medicine, medicine, medicine, front of the ses-half billion.
That's a little bit of to do that for that.
We use five billion ton collective millions, more 30 billion for oly.
That's 100 milos a day.
When we ended biological processes in ogency or whether what is going to be able to read that a huge challenge of a huge challenge of the challenge of the point of the engages.
Then of course, there is all these carbon dioxide of the state of the state of the atmosphere.
And as we have the global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had a dog different components, and look at the diversity that is from the diversity that is front of of the diversity that is from the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of electronicaindustry.
We are progress, by a biological reality and our existing imagination.
We don't have techniques to thesemethods to do this is the combined to the combinative genomics of doing the combining genomic.
We now have the possibility to build a great robot that a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a million chromosomes.
If you think about the consideration of 20 million different genes of the things are trying to make processing to make octan to make care and making cinating cinate, new vaccins, we can change with a little team changes, we can changes, we can change in the last 20 years.
And it's just standardly selection.
We can select for lives, chemical or brandst-stope production or brandstope production, vaccinproduction production, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real design design is where we really really really to work, so you can really the consider and a new kind of the computer in the computer of the computer of the computer in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of what the computer can design design the computer of the computer of the computer of the real design of the real design design of the real design.
We don't know person how it will see it from it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We four four generation of four generation of four generation of the four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of our generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of four generation of fourth generation of four generation of fourth generation in four generation generation of four generation as we fourth generation to re.
Our gars have founded to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will be able to get out of sugars will come out of sugar, to more and more and more and different suses like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can think biology large influence without the food is higher and the describes and the describes as we start with CO2 as we started to CO2 as his food and we see the first food that we do the first four propertor and we think that the first four generation and then we do the first four generation and then then then we are fourth to be able to have a major food squipullissue to get to get to to be a food and ree the first frowellyond to make it for about about about 18 monmonmonth
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoverover, we have all other method.
This is a organized that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deepic, about 2.5 miles in the deep, to coal head.
It makes meth, of CO2 with the molecular water state as energy as energy bron.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 and we can take easily fable, which is easily to fabried, where that CO2 to brandstrong to brander this process to break this process to strong this process to sture.
So in a short time we think we are thinking that we are in the basic question is, "What is liv?"
We have been a lot of them, you know, the protect purchemical industry.
Yeah. If you can do, you can do, where they w?
A important energy brother.
But we work on the way of these working on this worth to be strong series of these works.
This year was the griculture, we always just just like the facts of the facts of the facts of the facts on the right vaccine.
I think that can change that can change by by the textom.
So here you see how the future can see the evolution is the evolution message is going to change the evolution of synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukarily eukaril.
We are still far away from the conconnection of people.
Our goal is certainly to make a chance to survive to survival to survival to do that well.
And what I want to show you if you you can see is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to a new technology that we brought to a year ago.
And it's a environment where you can get to immense the immense of immense that we work.
We look at the gigabytes on the digital images and can be able to stay in the stay and the sors and the sors and the sors and the sors and the sors and the sors and the sors of our ws.
And it doesn't make it from how many information we look at this collections or imaginations.
Most of his normal digital camera photographs, but this is a source of the Liary or Congress, and sit in the 300 megapixel in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel of his normal the 300 meapixel of his normal digital camera p
It all doesn't matter because it was just because it only only the prestatations would be influence, the amount of the difficult of the screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible.
This is a completely book, a very example of notice data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Ela cold piece.
And to evidence that it really really really tiny -- and not a imagination, we can do so something that this really tect -- this is not a imagination.
Maybe this is a strange of a strange way to be a e-book.
I would not be able to be able to it.
This is a realistic, this is a realistic. This is a challenge of The Guardian.
Every big image image is the beginning of a deal.
This is gives you the place and the experience of a real paper in a real paper or whether well, which is actually a scaling media.
We also have something that with the corner of these except of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertention -- and we have extra information --
If you want the possibilities of these authore, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas as we can really make the constitutions of treating the constitutions of treatment to do the screen.
We open that this is not population more means and other third more means and other third -- not to be more than be more than be more meaning.
Of course, a landmaps a for the hand the hand the considered to a technology like this is a time to play here, I don't spend a time that we can also talk about this follows.
These are all the weak in the U.S.
And then the botttom, the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is the way in the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at the Web;
This project is called Photosynth, who two techniques two techniques of each other.
One of Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer fishing computer to the University of Washington, provening the University of Washington, aagree by Steve Seitz on the University on University on University on University to the University of the University of the University researchy of the University of Washingty.
and Rick Srare in Microsoft Research.
So this is the Web. It's the measure of the Web.
When we do, you can see this -- we see by the images and the multi-resolution resolution experience.
The space is a shapes of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the imagining of the images of the images of the ima
The computer vision algoritmes have these images have been built this images that they are considered the real space -- the Grassi in the Canadeal Rockish. So what they are genome.
I don't know sure or there is another time is, other environments to show you a time --
There are a lot of space.
I like to like to be a war seats of the war sea-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynthese, that we work this such is the choice -- to the choice that we have the cheat the challenge of these technique of the environments on our website.
We had to know about the advocates with the advocates and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notrace Dame with images from Flicks. You see, you can just Notre the Dame in Flicks, and you get images of people in the hot and the campus and the campus and equation.
And each of these orange chest, a picture of these orange that model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of the chirs of these oranimal --
And so these all of Flickr imagining imagining in this way in this way of space in the way of space.
And we can figate in education for education.
You know, I had never thought I was never thought I would never work to Microsoft would work.
It's very displayed here so that is so explore to be so much of it.
I believe that you can see that this many types of the sing: everything of gsm to spirirreflexcameras, a great number of them.
I will try to find what strange the images of the images of the images
There are so many people in searches and the same thing that is several affect and equips.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are side.
This is a poster of the Notre Dame that is good-chured by the program.
If we care in the poster in a physically, in a physically, in a physicics of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with social environment. This is the data of everyone -- from the data of everyone -- from the fact, on the fact, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth -- and so.
All these pictures are photos and shapes a very little bigger than the sonto the shead.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the Earth is from the Earth
And this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the United States.
And this is something that growth in complexity when it uses the use, and value the profront of the people who use it.
Their own photos are making the metap-data that somebody else.
If somebody would like to be able to influence and their names, and their names, and it is my picture of the Notre Dame is that that data, and that I can use it to the space, and that that we can use a access to that space, and create the photos, and create a cruple of cruise and create a kind of cruise and creation.
And of course, it's for a imments of this imments of this imments of any interesting of any interesting place in the Earth, which is not just from air-photographs, sately, but also from the collections of the collectively photographer.
Our severtly,
Chris Anderson: Have I started good good starting to be able to make it possible to a days, in the next years, all images that are the images that are the world and can cope on the world and can copope the world and can cope the software in the world and can cope?
BAA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
It create, the wens, hyperlinks between imagining imagining between imagining imagine.
And it does that on the basis of the data in the data in the imagining imagining imagine.
And that is getting a spanning when you think about the rich challenge of semantic information that many of these imagines.
When you look at the web search to image a search of the web and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagination about what the imagine.
What if this is that imagination is that imagination is to your imagination imagining imagination?
And then the number of supply semantic connect and the amount of rich that is gigantic networks. It's a classic networks. It's a classic networks.
CA: Bluise, that's really incredible. Gefelicits.
One of the intense place of reizing research and of eventual research is the possibility to live that the old lives, who are not distated, who are more than the provide in the wind, the profited sting, the propertile plane.
