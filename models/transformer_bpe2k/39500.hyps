Last year, I showed these two slides to show that the polar ice capture, which had about the past three million years of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S. with 40 percent of the U.S.
But this is actually the nst of this particular problem because it wasn't showing the disguide of the ice of the ice.
The ice skap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, heart of our global climate system.
It was in the winter and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showed is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is purpose in red.
Like you see it down to dark blue.
That's the year, that's the year,
And the shrink-cope in the summer.
The so-called permanent, five years or older, five years or older, is almost like blood, that from the body is takes here.
In 25 years, it is from this to this to this for.
And that is a problem because the frozen frozen cross-frozen Icell and there is a very big amount of frozen carbon frozen carbon is that when the death by microbes that is being being being being being being in methane.
Cart with the total amount of reinigation in the atmosphere, that could be able to double that amount that amount of as we distinclude the point of debine that could be done to describe the amount of display to the debt amount of display that could double the amount of disparies that could double the amount of reinc

Whoo! It's OK. The question is the question is to whether we will be that
A reason for that, is that these huge "warm-break Greenland from the north of the north.
This is a melectwo-photograph.
The water volume is equipment bigger than ever ever it.
This is the Kanger-lussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea speate, because it landies mely, the landice where it comes into the sea place where it comes into the sea place where it gets into the sea.
These flow are flew of these flow flow flow
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, the largest ice mas;
Last month, reporteds of scientists that the whole continent now has a negative ice balance.
More specifically is the ice of the South Pole is in the West in the South Pole -- with a cell of catch underwater eiling.
The whole continent is for six meters sea set of sea set of sea -- just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of largest ice massa, there are now new now, that was still new business of glaciers were still goos.
40 percent of the world's population is the half of his drinkwater from that melt.
In the Andes, this glestar the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more currently stroms.
But when they disappears the drink water.
In California, there was a 40 percent in the snowe of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoice.

This global dream of dried dreamount of forest burns of forest burns.
And the number of nature's packed with an incredible and never see an incredible and never see in the end.
Four times more time in the last 30 years.
This pattern is completely unlike this.
If you look at it from a historical context of a historical context what happened here.
In the last five years, we have 70 million tons at CO2 every 24 hours.
25 mice miles in our oceans, every day in our oceans, look at the east of the Sille Pacific, from America, as, and each side, and every side of Indian subcontinent, there's a drastic dalation of the oceans.
The only great cause of the global warming of the Earth, which is the deforestation, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is a problem, and coal is the very biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest exciteers, with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-carbon carbon carbon and build a lot more coals.
But we see a cirmale.
These are the coal-carbon that the building was the building and the entire years and where green alternatives were precise alternatives were forward.
There is a political fighttle on the high of the country.
The coal carbon and oil industiry gave industire for 250 million dollars to promote coal coal coal coal coal coal coal --
And that picture was a little bit of something like this.
And then the Churmas was at me at Tennessee, about four billion liter comod literally four billion gallons of gallons --
You probably seen it in the news of news in the news of news.
This is the one biggest solid biggest several souple of America.
This happened to the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking on the cost cooking was these.
Video: "Frosty the coal guy is a key key of guy.
He's overfluences here in America, and he makes our economy.
Frosty the coal guy is scany scanning with the day.
He's paid and estimate and cute employee."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia in West Virginia from day.
The largest mines of the country is the great jobs of Massey Coal.

That's why it is the reason the main goal is to give a giant connections to advertising for the light and bring the light and the regular of the truth of stead.
Facey, coal is not smary.
We find that the clean is -- and it still cooper.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just just about us.
Video: Actor, Schone coal, you have a lot about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern clean cools centrale.
Fantastic. The machines are pretty much a little noise.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
And despite the fact that the city of coal warming coal warming of the main causes of the Earth is shape, the remarkable schan technology that you see here.
Look at all, this is the clean coal technology of today.

And then you know, New investments to create jobs.
Voice: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There is an old African speaking word that says, "If you want to be all of the time.
If you want to go far together."
We have to go far and fast;
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am for those who are not sure those who wasn't there: the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever undernear.
It has to be the circumstances that were represented under a billions of second after the universe was started to be 600 million times a second after the universe was started to be 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitiously, so.
This is the machine is the machine of Geneve.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and this is the one that I'm work. It's called the ATLAS detectors detectors -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter of diameter in diameter in diameter diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in connectivate so you can see the scale.
And at 10 seeptember last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
And that was a partment in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was all around the LHC, and with the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September the machine was working on the machine, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this was the biggest strong, or this, when someone went to Google and saw that the Internet page looked like this.
That means that we have a cultural and a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact that we have a both of both an cultural as a scientific im
And one week later we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden weat.
These wears ago, 13 thousand ample when the machine on the whole power working for the entire power.
The engineers under you will say, "Not true. They're too small drad."
They can do that because they are supermoved on very low temperatures.
So on minus 271 degrees, colder than the space between the space that can behaviors that flow ago.
In one of the connections between the nine of nine in the LHC, was a constructive.
And it was the wire was wire something and was suddenly electric resistant resembling 13 thousand ample is that 13 thousand a little bit.
This was the result.
This is still impression is even more than 20 tons if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons and were about 30 inches were mostly 30-inches were mostly replaced to be mostly 20 tons of the way.
We were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did.
We all have these things that we all disappeared it.
Now they're back to the way.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We will take it back again, and we expect measurements in juni or justice, so we can go to figure out what the building stone of the universe.
Now, of course, these unhappiness accidents the debate of the value of scientific research. It's easy to be working on the debate research.
I think the fact that it's a hard thing that is so hard to go beyond the thing that is of things like LHC.
I let me show the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, who, I was done of the value of the value experiments of the value of his student, his student, "Nondly Farathers said, "Nsomething so dangerous for the progress of human mind that our images of human mind to be that there are not a mysteriod that there are no new world's not a new world."
Thank you very much.
I would like to start asking you to ask you back to your children at your children at your blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it, and then they picked up and covered and covered it and conscious problems with the deal with and hanging from space-relationships.
Rum-re-insight, is very strong by understanding the world to it.
If a information of information that inspired by the name of physical interaction with objects -- with my adviser Pattion and my collaborator, and my collaborator, I started to ask -- I started to ask -- what if we were used a computer of the environmental mative debend that would reaubash that moreaublad, which they could move on a plate desent device with the physical desophistication with the physical fish -- and they can be able to do the both of the physical interact with the information that is is is is is is that we can we can we can we can actually move destststrowididididididididdle with the neide the neide information that that the InIntermine of the In
and can ordering ordering as we want to do?
This question him was so that we decided to find an answer by building Siftables.
Cort case is a Siftable computer in the size of a cooky.
They can be moved with the hand, they can feel each other, they can detect their movement and they contain a screen and wireless the shell and wireless the soil.
The core nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be mostly like blocks to the blocks to the case of the blocks to it.
And the summary is Siftables an example of a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And this is that these aid resources have a more physical differently. And even of their movement and even of the way we move, and even of the way we move, there are different and cool interactions of all and fun interactions of the way we move them to discover and interact of the way we move, and even of the way we move them to be aid and n
I'll start with some simple examples with some simple examples.
This Siftable is instony to tell a video that is a video that plays and others and others it plays and others and others and it plays and others like that.
This interactive portraits of interactive portraits of each other.
Indian next to each other of Indians are going to interest for each other.
If they are surround, they can also figure it out some nervous and what nervous careful.
And they feel movement and call, and they movement.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting results of this interaction, the use of all the interaction, the use of all ades and as it was a fluid as it was a liquid as a liquid as a liquid as it was a fluid of color as it was a liquid of the interaction,
In this example of three Siftables lesson for and I can use them to go and use them color in a empty color in a empty of empty and they are being being being adaptables and I can use them
If we have three, we went to a little bit of return.
There are some of the couple of the education, mathematics and logics with language, mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to see things rapidly immediately and the result immediately extention.
So here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci through a simple acci accountor programmate.
So here we show a game that a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get around a randomly literally meant in every Siftle, and shaptic words are controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is very rescuam, and applies a new series of letters with contributing possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on expesion to the Media Lab, and I'm in the couple of the kids and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed to have instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Most word and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people test the tests.
That's our youngest breea tester, rightening.
And it turns out that he law the Sifttables lesson
For him was only blocks.
Here is an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning from language of language.
This is Felix that demonstration
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters of the table.
Here he leave the sun emerged the sun of the sun
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene scene of the scene
Video: The orantractor.
Good godnes! Yeah!
And by Sifta tables and the next to one another, he can respond to the characters respond to each one -- Video: Wdeal with each other -- Video: Wdeal with each other.
DM: and and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to deal with it.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I'm going to show you today Is a synesizer and live music and live music that we developed the lead, where every Siftles a sound produces a sound of sound and drum.
Eennither has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in the emptables so you can determine the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way, there are live controllling of a empty of empty as reverb and filter.
They are being added to a sound and added by changing by the office and they were pulled by changing by the way.
And every general effects like tempo and volume that tempo and volume that are added on the entire pattern.
Let's see.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern, to a lead.
Now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I add a little beat.
Video: DM: And now I copy the filter of the drums, so I can affect the effect live the effect of the impacts of the things that I can affect the pitch:
Video: DM: I can faster it by the office of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for a little more expression.
Video: DM: I can reaching the pattern as it plays it plays the pattern as it plays --
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise everything I can improvise the very longer and shorter as I want.
And eventually the dimmaking the dimmaking the volume Siftape to left the left Siftoo.
Thank you.
Like you can see, my passion out to make new people of new people interfaces that are better interfaces that are better dested in the way our brain and bodies and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area that we develop with some possibilities that we develop the lab that we develop in the lab
The thought I would like to talk about is that this is just the attention to a whole new generation of high meant to the interacting with digital media, that information to our world as we want.
I thank you from heart.
I look at it to you with all of you.
I'm writer.
Books are my work, but also writing so much more than that.
My whole life long I've been writing for writing and I don't think that that will change ever change.
And yet, there's something that happened in my life and carrier in my life and carrier and carrier through my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work with my work and carrier is in my life and carrier is a property of the work.
And it started with a book that I have written recently written a memoire: Beminnerat, which is very very contradiction to my first work, and an international work on the world and an international exist.
The consequence is that people have to go all over and always teged me as if I do do do I do.
And that is what -- gets dow!
People come to me and ask and ask to me and say, "Are you not afraid you can never be able to evenar?
Don't you get your whole life suggests to write your entire life suggests that people will be published for warm.
Don't you get these?"
Excuse of restated, you know.
Of course, that would be very very -- I remember that I remember over 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was a teener -- I was a teenot -- I was going to be a teeno.
People said, "Don't you get success, you don't get success.
Don't you get to deal -- that you go to the supposed to it up?
Don't you get your life to this work without any of this work without that there ever something out of this work, and you will be able to deal with your broken grab with your broken grab with your smothern aged with your sample bit?"
Something in that streting.
In the short, my response to that questions on this is "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid for all those things that are called "enmember.
All right.
But I'm also for a lot of other things scared to know what it all of it.
For example, for example, and other engineering things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time that comes from, and the last time that comes from.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that someone is affecting to be joined to the work for that they were to their opinion.
What is so particularly is creative processes that we make sure that we make sure the effects of the mines-estesged work, something that doesn't happen to the other other work.
Take my father. He was a chemists engineer, and I can't remember that there was a couple of 40 years he ever asked to him that he was ever asked to him if he was not afraid to be a scale of it.
And that said, "Yohn, how did it with your chemblock?"
No, you know, it wasn't talking about it.
To be fair -- chemists have been separently by the centuries of the centuries are not the reputation of manic-depressive alcohosts to be manically,
You know, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers also other creative people have apparently been reputation of people have been pretty instable.
Look at the grimming death the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many diversity display died by own stify by their own stified by their own stify display died by their own stiled.
And even those who don't have a suicide suicide suicide to be under their gaine.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "Don't any of my books is a piece of myself."
That's a little bit of a lot of life work.
But of this kind of excited we don't look like that.
We all have heard it all before, and I have it accepted.
The reason the sense is that creativity is that creativity is unlocked with suffering and that an artist will lead to miserable.
So I want to ask everyone today I want to ask everyone today you live in this idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because now I think I don't even think about it, I think it's not a pretty good thought.
I think I think it is read.
And also a dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is so that this is so much as well.
We can spirit to be able to live much better to live and lifetime.
I know sure it would be in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous to live to that dark in the dark thought.
Sur, the phase of my career is in the phase is now
Go just took you a young a regular year.
I can do maybe four decades to work on the decades.
Hharastony is probably going to be even publics by the extraordinary world as the work that extraordinary is that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can probably you can probably be my biggest success -- it's probably my biggest success
Jemy, what a idea!
If you go and think of you are the for you to know the morning, you know, in the morning to the hour.
So I don't want to be that.
I love to the work that I love to work that I love to work that I love to the work I love to work that I love to work that I love to work that I love to work that I love the work I love to work that I love to the work I love to the work that I love for.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after a long time I think I am to the conclusion that I can just go with writing as a psychological protection in the process of building.
I have to write a safe distance distance between myself and my belief very very very sensible fears of the response to my future published response to my future published the response of the response of the response to my future is to write a safe of the response to write a saf
I did the last year, I was looking for ways to do that.
I am in the history and I do inside of history, and I remember in other civilizations to see or someone better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search for me to the old Greek and Rom.
Let up, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Rombs and Rombs people didn't have that creativity was from herself.
And they believed that creativity was a divity of divital spirit, which was a written across the human beings and unknowledged reasons.
The Greeks called the Greeks called the creativity "demonstration of demonstration "demon.
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that represented him words influist.
The Romb was a species of idea.
And if you were called a seatch of creative mind creative minds.
The funny is that the Rombs don't have a genius to be an extended to be extended to be able to clear.
In their polisy was a genius was a kind of magical god-such godd-in the walls of the ength of the arty.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house
If the artist was working on the genius assistance.
And he gave it in the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the earlier, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work.
The artist was taken so in protection of the next for example,
If you was brilliant work was brilliant to be all honor for it.
Everybody knew that a couple of genim that a had hell genius you had helped it.
And you get crowd your work was just just just you read that not just you.
Everybody knew that you had a rather independed genia.
Long time is that been been to the West, in the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed was the Renaissance, and everything changed was the Renaissance, and everything changed was the Renaissance, and everything changed.
And there was a whole new idea: the individual human is the individual human is the center of the universe and above all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures,
And that was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history was there about artist in history that they were not a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and they were not a genius and not that they had a genius and they had a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a geniushe'd a geni
I have to say that I think that a big mistake.
To one person, one single individual -- one individual is that he or she is the vehicle is the essential of the century mystery, of everything that didlaborate -- that's too much a responsibility of fragile -- that's a lot of responsibility for a fragile.
And if you ask someone the sun inside the sun
Egos are recharge to a giant proportions and there are increasingly high expectations to prestations are reducation to restons.
And I think this pressure has been made a lot of artist capot of artist capo many artists.
If that is, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this differently?
Can we return on a parent understanding of the relationship between human and creative mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can have rational humanism not to make 500 years, not under to make 500 minutes in a 18 minutes of the end.
Probably in the audience of people that remember that reduced the idea that elfell over the idea that elflows on the idea that elfocused with some feeent the work of artist to inspiring height.
I don't like I get to get you to get to you in that.
And yet, I'm asking it off.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that thought not to do this thought,
It cut as much as much as much as all the other explanations of totally calculation that decided to be able to incalculation that decided in the creative process.
And everyone who has to create something that has to create -- so in fact, all the adapted here -- you know that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to be rational adapted to be rational process is not going to be rational process is not going to be able to creative process is not going to be rational process -- and everybody rational process is not always rational process rative to create rational process.
And that sometimes it feels almost paranormal.
I have the great American closer American Ruth Stone Ruth Stone of the American --
It's thick in the nine gentlegs. Her all life already writing them.
She told me about her childhood on the Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was felt the work was felt to the job of the country.
And it was so so they said, as if there was a big wave air came out of it.
And so a poem of golf than the country to her country to her it.
She felt that the ground was beginning to shake her feet and she knew that her at that time, only thing, to do that her life: render to her life.
And then they ran home, and they had to go through the poem and they had to do it as fast as quickly possible.
When it poem by her hand her hand her hand her hand her only chance to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then they roughly aren't reaching the house not to home.
And at such time, the poem by her him, and then pushed over the fields, looking for the fields, in her words -- to another poem.
And then I also also think that I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they almost poemist.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper and paper the paper by her him.
Just at that time, she had a pencil.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she plucked the poem out of the air.
She picked the poem back into its tail, and then it back into her body, and she wrote it back into her body,
In that cases came up with the poem of well-well-up of paper, but then in the paper order.
When I think that I thought I was -- which is so affecting my creative process.
This is how my creative process! I'm not medium! I'm not medium!
I'm a mouth, that every day in the same time time time time time time purching and trans with blood, sweand trans through it.
But even in that daily swan aws, I had a such an experience.
You will also know it ourselves that the sense that there is creative ideas in your recordity of a source that you can identify impossible.
What's that then source?
How can we use it without a lot of the way we get to?
And in a way that is good for us.
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
I interviewed it for a couple years ago.
We had it about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life is a lot of the shows of the contemporary artist artists that are trying to get out of all power to the uncontemplately response to the ununconsidered in him.
With the years Tom was a little rustiger.
And one day he saw in Los Angeles over the front of the celerator changed the process of run.
And as he was so he heard a clip, he heard a clip,
The decided to him, as inspiration that is more faker is doing it unusual, cellent.
It was a beautiful melodic and he wanted to hold the vasthor.
But it wasn't going to do that.
He had no paper -- no paper at any joink; he had no regular --
The well-known excitement again, "I read, I love the melodic eterness, and then it stays to remain regular eterfollow up to the century backwards.
I can't be good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get in panic, but he stops all in panic, but he stops whole mental process and did something new thing.
He looked up to the air, and he said, "Sorry hear, can't you see that I'm behind the sense of the stuff?"
"Do you really think I can write a song now,
If you really want this song to get it later you have to add up if I have time for you.
And not not not -- anyone else lots of a difficult difficult anybody else.
Go neighborhood's neighborhoo." And from that moment lose the process of a lot of process very different.
The work is even the work is the same thing with the dark of dark supposed to the same thing.
But the heavy excited the creative process in him reported the process in the way he was distance of genion.
The genius was going to close to the skin and supply just up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to the bottom by it.
It could also be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the conversation between Tom and the ownership that was not completely from Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of working on the story.
I had been profit from it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddark process. Beminning.
And at a moment I agree in despair.
You know that you don't want to be able to catch and you think it's a horrible disaster disaster is going to be a horrible disappoint.
Not just just bad, you know, really horrible bad.
I wanted to do all the project whole project --
And then I remember Tom that was reminded to his genius and I also decided to way.
I wonder from my manuscrips and directly to a empty of the room.
And I said, "Lister then, "Lister then, we know all of that if this book is not just because of this book is not just by me.
You can see that I have all in what I have in my thing.
I can't give you a lot of them.
If you think it's better than you have to come to you, you have to get your things.
Do you don't have that you don’t do that, you don't have that.
I just write because that's the work.
Oh, and in the notulen can be seen that that you have to be a different way to be appeard."
Tja--- Utiny it comes up here --
Every euws came up in the North African desers of people to make month, to math, to math, to math,
One, and hours and hours of hours glors.
And that was always great, because the dancers were completed professionals.
But sometimes, something, something, something.
One of those dancers was then transcendent.
You know whatever I mean, you know, you have ever seen something like a performance of a performer.
It was as though time and the dancer by a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights and then it was just soft everything together.
And suddenly he didn't care just a human beings a human human beings
In him, above him glood.
A goddness hot of good.
And if something that happened to knew people who had happened to be to clap them and clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was for them.
By the way, a fun historic fact, when Moren South South South Spanishy Spain this habited with it.
The outcome, the outcome, the eterns of the centuries of "Allah." Allah."
And that you hear the day at day the day at day and flaments and flaments and flaments today.
If an artist in Spain a something impossible, or magic is calling human being: "Allah, oil, ost, Allah, violence, Allah, violence, follow."
And it's a glimpse of God.
Precipe what we need.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the next morning that the next morning to the decar to mean that he discovered on dinning 11 --
At that moment he's back a little elder guy with rebad cnees that may never come to such up to such more to such up.
Maybe there will never be anybody else someone else while there is dance.
What does it have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell that is really hard to sell creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be so painful to be so painful to be so painful to it.
Imagine that you don't go from the most unusual aspects of your person from your person out of your person from you.
Imagine you believe that you have a while to be able to specify from a fairly specifate source.
When you are ready with it, they are giving to someone else.
And that's how it is a lot of everything.
I hang in the average of the thought of the thought of the thought.
And the last months I have a book that will be short. The book that will short. The book where many too long as a lot of extended to be extincludes to be extincludes to be approach.
The operquors of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me on the hand, I like this is just the same thing to be the same thing, don't don't don't rethink of it.
Do just you work.
You just do thing, whatever it is.
If you have task you to, thank you very much.
If the dival genius that you have been decide to make in your work at any time, at some amazing source somewhat the wonderful source, then "Oly!"
And not exchange that not, thank you only go through it.
And then "Okay!"
I believe that I believe that I believe hard.
"Oh, anyway!" because we stay from pure and property, but it's equality by ploes of the pure of human love and property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: OK!
You know, I had been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genome and discovering new sets of genome and discovering new sets of genome and what that can mean to be able to discover the genome of these projects,
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to digital digitizing the digital code and now we try to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology and synthetishing and synthetishing life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think I think that have tried to understand it in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand the different levels.
We tried different approach, it bringing back to minimal minimal components.
We're almost 20 years,
When we have sequenced the human genome genome of the biology, went from the analog world of the biology, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for life to regenerate and we can create regenerate, or can we create new, from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can refills in a laboratory in a laboratory in a laboratory --
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature smaller genome can be a nature smaller genome --
We can cut in the order of hundred of them out of 500 or something,
But if we look at metabolic map, that relatively compared to the indeed of the call.
Gelord me, this is simple --
But when we look at all the genes that we can switch, it's very improbably very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell cell cell cell cell of the genes that would be able to switch a living cell cell of the genes that would be a living cell cell cell cell cell that this would
So we decided to be the only route conditions to synthesize this chromosome of the most fundamental questions. So we could take the components to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions like that, "Can we have a chromosome syntheses?"
Staat the chemistry to make these very big molecules that we never see?
And, if we can a chromosome "meeting?
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way, a little piece of chemical inguide --
So, the digitize of digitize of digitize life is accelled exponential way.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather rather slowly slowly slowly of the genetic code of the genetic code to write the genetic code of the genetic code of rather as writing the genetic code as a long slowly slowly slowly slowly s
And our last point the moment would take places on an exponential curve.
We're starting here over 15 years ago.
There were some stages to invition, and there were a bio-ethical devices reversation to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be a very hard to be a lot of DNA is very
There are teends of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so the longer you make it pieces of the world that are going to be able to make it pieces of DNA to be able to make it pieces of DNA to 50 letters in the world that we
So we had to add a new method for the collaborate of these little pieces and core of all the errors of all the errors of all the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to the digital information of the genome of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces of the pieces of the packaged
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The span to be taken up when we stop a piece of chemical chemical chemical chemical code in the bacteria and the genetic code and virral particles and virale particles and making virtually guns.
The viral particles were taken out of the cells, they were coming out of the cells, and they were reaching the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but all too well.
They laughed more than you laugh.
So we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chro
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassettle in cassettle of viruses, so we could actually the cassettes various --
to understand what the confoundly components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you begin with digital information in the computer than must be very accuraft.
When we first assumed this genome was the default of the default was a single from, one a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found after resequencing. If we had 30 mists. If we had the original sequence than it was not able to start.
Meancy of the design of pieces that 50 letters that have to be able to relapps out with all other pieces of 50 letters to build so doing, that we need to design so that we have to design so that they can go together.
We design unique parts in this way.
Maybe you have read that we stopped watermarks in the watermarks.
Design, we have a four-letter-meter-couple of genetic code: A, C, G.
Trios of those letters code for ruwle 20 aminozurs -- that there's an amazing attack-oxyoxioxyoxioxyoxioxyoxi.
So we can use the genetic code to write, sentences, though.
We just think that we were just determine only for that.
Some of them were definitely that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repair and put together.
And we started to make pieces of calls that were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters long, only that you have pieces of 24,000 letter, then then sets from 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stadium we knew a abundance of these pieces so we could sequences them because we could create a process that very robusts -- that will be very robusted -- that you will be very robuying -- you know, you know,
We're trying to reach the point of automatishing.
So this looks like a basketball final.
And as we get to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares, they don't grow so easy more in E. coli.
And that does explain the most of all modern tools of the molecular biology.
And so we went to reach the other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that homologists is called "homologic that is used by the biology to repair DNA -- and they can add the pieces of cash and covered pieces of the casure.
Here's an example of this.
There is an organism called Deinocococcus radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radio radiation to radio radiation of the radiodurants of radiodurans that three million radiodurans that three million radiodurans that have three million radiodurans in the way.
And that you see in the upper panel, in the upper panel, just a little chromosome of the other.
12 ots of 24 hours later it again, and it was going to put it back to each other, exactly as the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dried up.
They can live in a vacuum in a vacuum in a vacum.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space that can be able to move forward, a new aquatically.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the way from here, outside.
Here's a device-working micro-photograph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually, just yester-making mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did.
Gests it care of automatically.
This is not electronen-microscope photograph. This is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures over a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we expand we expand we expand
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a humans, with a clearly structure.
The molecule weight is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then 142 pages just to present the genetic code alone.
Now, how do we started, how do we get a chromosome of the activate on?
And it's clearly a virus of this is a rather easy pretty easy.
And a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simple if you give your eukaryots, like us, you know, you just whether you know it whether you know if you give you the cell and that's what you know as reading.
And if you look at the bacteria is chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome transplant transplant of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another, and can activate it to another, and can activity.
We have a chromosome of a chromosome of a micromosome of micromosome of the micromosome of the micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of a micromosome of the micromosome of a chromosome of the micromosome of a chromosome of micromosome of the micromosome of a micromosome of micromosome of the micromosome of the micro
These are about this is about about as far as people and much.
We added some extra little extra so we could select for this chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome of the extra little extra little extra little extra little extra little extra little extra little extra little extra little extra for this chromosome of chromosome of the extra to select
We have response to create all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we stop this in the cell -- and you will be able to the very advanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to the solid of the process of we were trying to develop the process of what further to do it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of these kinds of chromosome of third chromosome of third chromosome of thousands of characteristics in one time to the species.
People that evolution are not going to have one of the same equipment are not a lot of biology.
There are enzymes that are restriction and enzymes that are really called DNA A to restone.
The chromosome that was not like in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of the chromosome of it.
It was expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as strange material, and so we had the endly, and we had the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of
He was blue because he was blue because of the genes that we had in it.
And in very short time disappears all the characteristics of one species and changed the new software that we stop in the new software that we put in the cell.
All proteins, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was exactly the genetic code was exactly where it was changed the genetic code was exactly what it was changed the membranes -- when we were changed the member, the members changed the member, the members that it was exactly exactly the the member, all the member, the member,
This is a major sound as genomicall, but we are in the case of the software DNA, to change things fundamental -- to change things.
Good, I've been paid of earlier that this is not a creation of a creation -- this is the majors of evolution, and I paid evolution, and I paid that we might be almost a new version of the Cambban explosion of the Camban explosion that are making new species of the engineer.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly as you look at what needed is to require.
We're going to go into six-and-half billion people, and nine billion people, for the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context, I'm born in 1946.
There are three people on this planeet.
for each of us that living in 1946, within 1946, that there will be four there.
We have a disasting clean food, with the care water, drugs, fuel for the six-and-half billion.
And that is hard to do that for nine to do.
We use five billion tons of collion,
That's 100 miloons of lions a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or which process is also to replace that process than to replace that a huge challenge.
And of course, then there is all that carbon dioxide of the dioxide atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We're very constrained by an biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of techniques now synesemethods to such so called combination genomics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a great robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or try to optimate processes to optimize processes to produce octaneously produced to produce or medicine, we can change more molecular biology than in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard of selection.
We can select for life-fatbular, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so on.
This is a screen of what real design software where we work, so you can actually go to the high and can actually make a new kind of a new kind of on the computer and can design a new kind of the computer of design and can design a new kind of a new kind of a computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the things that we can actually make the game of the things that we can actually design a new kind of a screattackastonish.
We don't know person to look like it.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth of the fourth of the fuels.
Remember you have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second generation and third generation that will come out of sugar, to more higher fuels like sugar, to more higher fuels like octan occasional butano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food price higher and the availability to reduce the availability as his food supply and so we are just starting to design that way, and we think that we are the first generation that we do the first generation of the way, and we think that the first generation burned generation and then we have the first of the years and then the fourth of about 18 months.
And slight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 kilometers deep, at the deep, at cost temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with the help of molecular water drogen as energy source.
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 and we can be able to take through paper, which can be capable to factory, which that CO2 to send the CO2 to send this process.
So in a short time spend spend that we are able to expanding out of the basal question: "What is life?"
We really know -- you know, you know -- the definitely define the petrochemical industry.
Yes, if you can't do this at TED where?
A major energy source of energy source.
But we also work on the case of these tools to be able to think about fast-stop servaccines.
This year, the year, we just just just just something behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change by the temptation of temporary vaccines.
So here you see how the future can see because the evolution tree is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still avoid from the improving people.
Our goal is surviving a chance to survive long enough to survive long enough to survive to survive to do that probably you can do that.
What I want to show you as a little bit quickly the fundament of a new technology that we brought to be overname to Microsoft a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon. This is
And it's a surround, in which you can local or at remote with immense amounts of visual data can work with immense data
We look at this point here many gigabytes to digital images and can keep down here, and expand challenges and the sorts of covering and the sorts of digital and the sorts of wish.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at the major images are these collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and is in the 300 megapixel of the 300 megapixel
It all doesn't matter any thing because it would be affected to affect the amount of pixels on the screen of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a book of non-image data.
This is the graue house through Dickens. Each column.
To evidence that it is really textest and not imagination, and not can do something that is really textile that is really textile -- this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a very book way to read a strange of read.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a realistic example of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of an underly.
This is really gives you the pleasure of a real papers of papers or neator newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something that we did with the corner of this extended from The Guardian.
We made a nep advertising of high-resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we restraight information -- and we resolution -- and we resolution -- and we resolution -- and we have extra lot of advertising advertising -- much higher than a normal advertis
If you want to see the opportunities of this car -- you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can actually make the restraints of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen through the screen of hands through the screen through the screen through the screen of the ideas can do the screen of the screen of the screen through the screen of the constraints of hands through the screen through the screen of the screen of hands through the screen
We hope that this is not going to mean and other things like this and other flaul -- not needed it will be more like that.
Of course are maps a crubbt of the engineering for a technology like this, I won't spending time to spend here, except that we can also contribute to be able to contribute this field to be able to contribute this field of a supply as it is that we can contribute to be a lot of these five agry stone,
These are all the roads in the U.S.
On the top of the NASA -- a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is Photosynth, those two techniques of two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and the other thing is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, provenue to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz at U...
and Rick Sselfselfiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's suppotentially by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, that we see the images of images diving and the multiresolution resolution.
The space-source of the images here is meaning here.
The computer vision algorithms have these images, so that they readent the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they're genomes are taken up with the real space of stabilized diassistabilized diassistabilized diassistabilized by the real space -- and all these things are space space space -- and all these things are space -- where they diduring the space of the clucraft -- where they are taken re-away that
I don't know sure or there is time, other environments.
There are a lot of more more space too more more space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked in this summer, which is the actual force of this summer, the actual force of this engineering the environments to look at the environments on our website.
We had to do it with the lawyers, and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get people in t-shirts, and the campus and thirs, and the campus and thirs, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus of the Notre Dame with the images of the Notre Dame with pictures of the Notre Dame with pictures in Flickly Dame with pictures in Fame with picture.
And each of these orange chain, a picture of image that model.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are all copied in this way of springs in this way.
And we can do at simple way to navigate at simple way to navigate a simple way to navigate at simple way to navigate a simple way to navige.
You know, I never thought I would never work at Microsoft would work at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so until to be so extend to be so extended to be so extended to be so extend to be so until here.
I believe you can see that these many types cameras, all of guntil reflexcameras, a great number of it, a great number of it, a great number of it, consideration in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so much worked by facing faces and so much like that.
And somewhere between a series of pictures -- here they are like this.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also churged by the program.
If we dive the poster in a physical picture, in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say with this is that we can really do things with social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- of the entire collective memory of the entire collective memory that everything to each other.
All these pictures are being constructed, and shapes a very little bigger than the sharing of the parts.
You then have a model that came from the whole Earth of the whole Earth of the entire Earth
So this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Aller's work.
And this is something that grows in complexity when they use it as it uses and the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being able to remetap-data that somebody else invoting somebody else invod.
If someone would like to climb all these heads and their names and their names and their names is reverse by the Notre Dame is reverse that data, and I can use as a access to that space -- and then that metape versus a kind of cruise model, and created this kind of cru-model, and created social experience.
And of course, the by-product of this immense virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which not just from the air pictures and other applies and other appliess. And also the collective images and other applies' collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understood that what makes your software possible to be able to do it in the next years, all the images that can be determined by everyone in the world can cope to cope together in the world together and cover?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovery.
It creates your wish: hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the images.
And that is exciting exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of these images are definitely available information that is available to be available to be away.
When you look at the web page of images, you feel a search in and the text on the webpage on the webpage of information on the image of information on the image of the image of image is given much information about what the image of images.
What if now is the image couple of your images?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes out of that, in fact, which is a classic networking effect. It's a classic networking effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense places of travels and events of enographic research is the potential to live in the wind, that lived living in the wind, which have to be ancient the wind, the touch in the wind, the profiting in the wind, the profound in the profine bitters.

The best indicator of this is the loss of this is paying is the loss.
When everyone was born born there was six-thousand talks on Earth were going to be six-taking talks on Earth was in the earth couple of the earth call.
A language is over her word or her grammatical rules.
A language is a copaging of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that through the soul of every unique culture.
Every language is a century age-old old old old old an ecosystem to spiritual an ecosystem to spiritual opportunities.
And from that six-thousand of talks today is not free in the dayors of that are fluid in children oren are fluist.
They are not longer took a babies longer tell.
Effectively means that unless a change, that they are already already dead.
Is there something a little little bit of the held by getting the last of your engineering too speak, the last of your language, no chance to spend the wisdom of the ancestors of the kids have to see or the re-inforced by the tegetting the children have to see the teachers of the children have to be your language.

And they have the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
At this point is the intuitivea very important.
If we think of inhead, we often think of the landscape and we often Rousand and the old factory of the easy wild, a idea that racistic in his simplify wanted to be a simplify that is racistic in his simplify and the old fact that racistic in his simplify and the old face that racistic in his simplify that is racistic in his simple to be fabulous Roudge and we often like this.

It's a picture I am you -- it's a picture that I april in the North Wast-Amazon nam.
This is ayhuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing from the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayhuascinating makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential to it, but how fascinating it is built from two sources.
And one of the silliance of that betom, harmine and harmaline and harmaline and harmaline hears and heart hallucinating hallucinating hallucinating and heart hallucining hallucinating and hearmine is a wood.
If you take only the plant plant it looks like a blue regars through your consciousness.
The plant is mixed by a coffee with a coffee beat, Psychotria vireals.
The plant runs powerful tryptamines, nurturing the crazy serotonine, dimethyltry-ptamine, 5-making methoxydimethydimeth-ptamine.
Do you ever seen the Yanomami as they were that snuts, that substance of different kinds of different kinds of methoxydimethyptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami pet methoxyami as they have ever been sumed that methoxyonce of different kinds of methoxyongst of the Yancy ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami ptami as as as well.

I was trying to convince my professor, Richard Evan -- a man who was a man who did the psychedelical adevidly done by his discovery of paddos in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was paying that these tryes, these tryes, not to identify as hallucinating, because when it intricians, because when it involves intricate to the hallucination of the hallucination in orturing oral -- because they're definitely dish by an enzyme in the human darm-dominal changing arm-domin-cine-cine-ptacked oxian oxiancine:
They can only be ingenoms with something that the monoamine of suspect to see.
The fascinating is that the beta-carbolines in the beneath monodial suppressing the globes are to activate the tryptamine-ptamine. Itl yourself the try: How can this in an 80,000 plants of two morphological various species that are very largetting biochemical variant of the parts of the parts of that are larger than the shake of the partominy that is that larger than the shapacting of the squartering squartamine-ine-ine-ine-entamine-ently larire.
We say eufemistic "trial and ror," which is that as a meaningle-masky.
The Indians say, "The plants talked to talk to us. What does that? This stem means that? This stem is the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuasca, who can identify all the major distance of ayhul --
If you ask their taxonomy in map, they say, "I thought you know that you know something.
You know that at all, you know, I said, "no."
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night in a night in a night in a night of the enough shows in a night of the enough took in a night of the enough of the enough of night in a night of night in a night of night in a night of night in a night of the entire mess.
You don't have a little bit of Harvard, but it's a piece of bunch of a bunch of tell.
Now, the problem is that even those of us that sympathic and seems to be seemed with inhead, and colorful them as curious and colorful to a foot in history as the real world, and the real world, mean, the real world, is meant to the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not going to be reminded to be wars or technological innovations, but rather as the age of the age that we were stroy in order to the massive destruction of biological and the participles of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem is not change.
All cultures have always been sharing a dance with new life of life opportunities.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem of the problem.
The Sioux-indians don't stop Sioux and they couldn't put up their pile and bow up as they were stop and forced Americans and they were stop and ways.
It's not changed or technology that the integrity of the eat-feature endanger. It's power. It's power.
The wrete face of the government.
And what you also look at the world, you will notice that it is not the fate of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic living following existence is identify by identified by identify that rereach.

Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains, where I do, you see the wrace of political government.
Genocide, the physical excise of a people, universal rejudge of a people, but the destruction of the life of a people, not only is a lot of a people, not just divide as part of a development strategy.
The pain of Tibet is not to contain the basic level.
I have a young colleague 9,000 miles on the land of Chengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And it was when I came to Lhasa in Lhasa statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destroyed 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acknown to the Panchen Lama.
And on that was the basis on the basis was killed the Chinese invasion.
His flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which brought the people to Nepal people to Nepal people to Nepal in Nepal --
His mother prison was prison was because she was rich.
He was the prison the prison when he was two -- he was two -- he he hidden until in her rock, because they don't could.

And one day she got to be accident on a poor, of Mao. For this overtook seven years. And for seven years.
The pain Tibet can be unregular, but the free of the people of the people, is something to deal with your city --
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Do we live in a gray world of unitive or do we want a colorful world of diversity or diversity to reversity in a gray world of diversity or to be a colorful world of diversity or to be a colorful world of diversity or to be a colorful world of diversity or to be a gray world of a gray world of diversity to reversity of a gray world of sing world of a gray world of sheet in a
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead said that she was peace that we direction a general general, amorf worldview.
We would not only see the human imagination restricts to a small all of the model, but also we would have been defined and forget, and forgotten that there are other options.
We can feel our feeling that our kind of only 150,000] years, on Earth is about the idea that our kind of only 150] year.
The Neolitic Revolution, which we have agriculture in which we have been across the cult of the seed of the shaman was replaced by the proza shaman by the proza specialization of the priests and we found a specialization by the proshaman was only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years.
This surface is not giving the idea that we don't have the idea that we have all the answers to all the answers that the next millennia on our path.
If the intelligic cultures of the world to be asked the meaning of people, they answers to 10,000 different voices.
And it is that songs that we are going to discover again, and that is a conscious species that we are to, which is all the people, that is all the gars and all the gards and all the gardens of optimism.
This picture I have taken on the northern point of Baffin Island taken up with Inextently in the narwal
This guy, Olayuk, told me a wonderful story.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextent, in the 1950s, to be able to save our sover, in the seats of the settings.
The one of Olayuk the Olayuk of Olayers.
The family of peace for his life and recorded it all his cars, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inin not afraid for the colle; they use it to use it.
The gggiles of their keys are caused from their sleeks in caribook-making fish in caribook-
Olayuks the storm of the poolnight or the storm that was reaching the storm that was the storm that was saying for the poolnight or the storm that was saying for the poolnight or the storm that was saying for the pool.
He went out to outside, he showed his breeding skin, and he was poeped the poop began to woman, he was the payment began to woman, he was a limb.
He brought a low-to-layer on the sides.
And then then he was solid to be a dog of dog.
He was the dog and improvised a harnasts.
Of the riban he made a bad one.
He was looking at a dog in the neighborhood, and he was going to go over the ice foot poeppead.
And this is just about anything around with nothing in many ways, in many ways, the way of the Inin the resistant of the Inin and all the inall of the inall of the world.
In april 19999 gave the Canadian government the Inin the entire Inin the entire of a piece of country bigger than California and Texas is our new thue. It's called Nunavum.
It's independent. They remember. They remember all the regular commodity
It's an amazing example of how a nation state of how a nation can off.
And finally, I think it's clearly clearly to this high, at least for whom to these high-foot of the world is really, that they don't actually get away away.
They're someone's the person at home land.
They are definitely at the beginning of human imagination, which go back to the beginning of time. And for all of us are going to be the dreams of these kids, just as the un, part of a undefined geograph.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extremely the idea that politicians never reached anything.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convincing that stories can be tellers the world, that we can probably be the best tellers in the world, we probably the best tellers in the world, we probably the best tellers in 156 countries on TV and our magazine in magazine a milen-public.
We make a folding to the eating, and we have a free with our public, with our public, to such extraordinary places, where the incredibly affected by what he seeing so impacted to be so impulsion of the anthropology will be able to live in a multiony in a multicularly way to live in a multic world that we can find a way to life in a multiplual world to be able to find a follower.
where all the way of the environmental can contribute to our seems to our seems to be being being able to our seems to our consultances that all the way of the environment.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some questions that I have a book that I have a book that I have a book of a book of the couple of which I have power.
Maybe you see paralls with information from other sources.
I also try to explain some sense that you might have been told you might have been told you might have been tune to you might be able to explain a couple of the connected.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly the official dogma of all the Western industrialized society.
And that official dogma is aids like that is a follow: To spords of our citizens, to get to get so much individual freedom of individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good at part of the human beings of human existence.
And the suggests freedom is able to acting a higher which is to reach a higher which is to reach a higher which is to reach a crazy of these.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice-ability.
More choices that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more wealth.
This is so deep the deep in our society that nobody would read to it.
And in our lives is this dead is a dogma urban ahead of cover.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool. A tool.
Even about threat.
And at the time that 175 chances are threats in my supermarket, there are in my supermarket, and then extra-virgin oil and twel-virgin the affolollowing of the supermarkets of the supermarket,
And then you can make a tallow of your own threats to make a bunch between those 175 species for you,
So that's the conversation of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can put your stereoset and summarket, cases, cassister player, cassettes; cassettes;
At one electronicawincle you can choose out of this number.
You can put it together six and a million different systems, with parts of the store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Again, a different example -- communication.
When I was young for you long ago, you could ask all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You home the device. You don't bought it.
And that had the advantage that the advantage of the advanced that it had never been there.
And that time is forc.
Today, there are a lot of different statement.
And all of the cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that with the high player, neusha and cry-break-burning fuels and crack.
And if you don't seen this model in the store cellel in the store of that you can be that soon.
The consequence: people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do too much too much too much too much of it.
And also in aspects of life that are much more importantly, more important than the attack-shape, this explosive explosive increasingly of choice.
Gealth care -- it's in the U.S. is not the U.S. inavers that you have to go to the doctors and tells you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and I said, "We can do A A or Blet or we can do B to do B.
A precise this front and display this front of this one.
BB has this front and assumption this for?"
And you say, "Do cope, what do you find in the way?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front and the Braw, and the Bline has this front and down.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Do you say, "Do you know, what would you do you do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you know."
And we call that "own inputs of the patient."
And that sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decision of someone who is definition of someone who has been seems to be a sick of -- to a sick and not the best condition to take decisions. For on on the epativity. For on the patient is going to be much more advertising is much more advanced a lot of advances is much more re-re-regulation is a lot of adult -- the best condition of devictimistence.
Good deavailable to slap that because the purpose group, you can't buy it.
Why do do do do as a copy of copy?
Because they think that we think that we think that we are going to be able to ask that other brand ask that other brand really,
Our identity yet a ingrip, a ingrip, is now overcovered over.
Our identity is able to lose our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it.
Everybody morning, you have to think about what person you have to be thinking what person you want to be thinking what person you want to be thinking about what person you want to be think.
Let's talk about marriage, the family.
There has been a time that free-free everybody else automatically from that you could be able to married as quickly as possible, and then it could be able to children
The only choice was the only choice with who, not when and what you did did did you go and do it.
Now is free everything for the packs.
I teach teach at particularly intelligent students, which I have done by the homework than ear.
They are not heus are not dommer or than in the early time.
No, they have pressure with choices.
"Well I married or now? Is I now?
Or I'll walk with that? Take first, or a career or a career --
These are all the way to ask questions.
They go through to answer them to have an answer, as it means that they don't get all their homework and not circle couple of these things and not catch a good number.
And they have the same lifescare of living questions.
And then we come to work. Carl gave just that technology is allowing us to work every minute of every day-minute every minute of every day--- except in the Randolph Ho.
There is one place, which I love secret I love secret -- where WiFi does it does.
I don't walk like that, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choicy choicy of work in that we are incredibly asking and then whether we go and whether we go and won't working or not.
We can look at a football of our son's son on the one hand, with our cell phone, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and we can do it laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all come out of all the time that we are all all the time of that dominion, "Am I responsibility? "Am I answer?
I’m going to response this email, I write this letter?"
And even if the answer is "No." And we experience the football disappoints of our son a very different way.
Where we also look at the great, the small materialistic business style, life style, life style, life style, life style,
And this is how the world used used to look like it.
There were some choices but not everything was a question of choices of choos;
And this is the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about it is a lot of it is bad to it.
And that huge choicy choicy has two effects on the human beings of human beings.
A very contradiction is that it works before, it has been paralyzed before.
And so many choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatic example of this -- a research to investment in volunteer plans.
A colleague of me had access to investment data of Vanguard, a great policy-major polishing society with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vegetable.
They found that for every 10 of any 10 of the bottom of every 10 of the working far two percent took the particular, the particular.
At fifty far, five percent less employees to be able to do it in five percent of five and five foundses. Why?
Because it is the far, fifth is so hard to choose that people just choices people to choice to the next day, and that on, and that on, and so on.
And from the point is coming down.
It doesn't mean not only that people after their pensionate at the boards don't have any dream because they have been seeing enough money to have not been so hard so hard to have that they were so hard to have the worked that they have been a versaying that they shoot the worked for it.
And they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year, to go to the notion of their now.
The working was a couple to double.
So too many choices can be paralyzed with it.
And I think the world looks like this.
If it goes to the century to make a very very very much like to make a very right choice, right?
You don't want to be able to be wrong with the wrong found, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect is that we have the paralyzing of the dish of our descene and eventually less peace with the result of the result would be if we had less options as we had less options as we had less.
There are multiple reasons for that.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it could seem that the choice,
You put it in such case that a different choice to be better choice to be better choice
This dreamed alternative is that you get spids of your choice.
And spits of the choice of choice that you have made it and you made it and you made it -- even if it was a good choice.
The more options, the more option, the more response to have responds of the things that element of the gets of option.
Secondly, a second reason with a substitution costs.
Dan Gilbert gave already meant to how often we depend the value of things that we are dependent to the things that we are similar to the things that we are similar to the value of things that we are worth to the value of the things that we are depend the value of the morning that we are the value of the things that we are all the valu
If you think of the alternatives can be intracted to see many alternatives of all alternatives that you defense the attractivvities that you define the attractivities that you can see many alternatives that you can see many alternatives that you can see many alternatives that you can see many alternatives that you can see many al
And that makes you fewer peace with the alternative that you have chosen you have chosen crowd.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you -- my excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a set on the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are a wonderful strand. Stralend again.
Don't do it? "Don't make a this," thinks that man, "It's austom.
Everybody in my neighborhoods in Manhattan is the city of the city
I could car, my car for the door to door."
And he's sitting there with the idea that he was a great idea that he crip, which is that he cripped.
And substantial costitution costs are going to be cost of our choice, even if we make an amazing choice.
The more possibilities are there there are the more attractivvities are there.
And those are presenting us as a substitution costs.
Another example of a thing,
This image stories to a number of points.
Life in here, and for example, and you don't have to go and take things of things.
Another point is that you look at any choices of choices of choice.
And all that other has so his attractions that are chosen option is the geots of option is getting the crowd.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up with this stuff for a new bottom to a new bottom for a new bottom of this.
I turned out to almost emphases.
And it was only one kind of speaking -- and you cut it was just a pair thank you very much, it wasn't incredibly uncomfortable, but if you were working and often enough and often enough and often enough and felt enough and felt it OK.
And after years I went to the store for a news.
I said, "Day, I want to get a spirit -- this is my me."
And the winkeleer said, "Would you smart, easy fit, easy or relaxed fit?
Do you can you whether a rhyth?
Do you want to leave a breedom effect?
Do you can go something that extend to push or fline." And so he went out and so he went through this.
I was there of it. And I was a while I said, "I want to say, "I want the only one."
He had no idea which was not an hour, and so I have an hours all the possible of the point of greenhouse to pass all possible to pass --
It's very fairly -- I left the store of the wincle with an explored by an extended breet.
I had better it to do better -- I could do it better.
But I don't felt me better.
Why? To this to mean this to myself, I wrote a book I wrote a book of a book --
The reason I don't feel better with all that choice, was that I started expecting to expect of the fasts of a good speak of a good speak of a good speaks.
I started without any any expectation, because I only only only only one kind of speaking for one kind of speaking --
And then that there was different different and one of them would be fast perfect.
What I was bought was good -- but not perfect.
And so I recompared my bottom, and I was that asked me for the time.
The more possibilities people have the deserve more expectations they coosting about the deserve of those possibilities.
And that means people are less fewer are less peacevolved, even if it's good results.
Marketing people don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In the real thing is going to be about that.
Everything was worse worse when everything was bad at the botom.
Because when everything was worse worse was worse to be more surprising experience.
In our modern society we can we as well-be perfection, but the best citizens, but the best thing we can ever reach, is that something that we had to be reach.
Never we get touched because our expectations, my expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- this is not too much -- the secret of happiness is not too much expectancy is not too much expectancy --
I want to be here -- a car biographic element, I was a woman that I was a woman that is really fantastic element,
I have not asked her with less ratched her less tepitched with her fewer --
But with less enoughs to take his good sides.
And finally, when you get a bad bad breeding breedombs as there is only one kind of predictor of the predicts of the question of why you are intendency to be wrong.
The answer is that case, the answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different available, and you buy it turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer to me is just so simple that you have to be so simple --
You had better choice.
With hundreds of different boars of hundreds of different and fale.
So if people decided to decide even though the results of those decisions are good about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society has celebrate such depression in the younger generations of high.
A factor -- not the enia, but a significant factor, but a significant factor, is that people have so often insuicide and suicide suicide is that people have so often have to be so often by high expectancy of their high expectancy of depression and suicide a factor.
And then they try to explain that teleural for themselves, they give themselves the define of the wult.
So the nettoresial is that we go on the objectively on the objectively of it -- but our worse to feel objectively --
Another summarincluded.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is being being being agency.
But that's not not a lot of it.
It doesn't look at a doubt that can choose better than not able to choose it can't choose it is more choice even better choice.
There is a magic floor of choices of choices. Well I don't know.
But I know that we are all for long before for a long time to the choices that choices are profreedom.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle that we can keep the best to be able to keep the best one.
The choicy in industrialized countries comes out of material overfluences of material overflow.
There are a lot of places on the world, and we have already heard about that is not so much that there is too much that there is too much of choice.
So the paradox that I speak here for the moderne, so that I think that is a lot of the moderne, well.
That's frustrating, and you cut up here is that you would have yesterday you yesterday told that expensive and hard to install of the money.
I say the same about this pursuit -- they don't help -- they don't help -- they don't help to help them to get damage.
They make our lives less worth of our lives.
If part of what people in our society in our society to make all those choices to be transition to be transmission, the life would be able to be able to be affected to be able to get away from it.
And also our lives would go on it.
That's what economists and a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better from reverdiation of well-to-only poor people -- not just poor people -- and that comes through the key of choices that we are with our revert.
Finally, you read this sculpture of the sculpture -- you know, you say, "Ah, what knows that fish is that fish fish from it?
None is possible in a fish."
A scrace imagination, a short squarticular -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it, I think about it, I understood that this fish is the same smart.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you bad the fishing to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create potential to create the fish call.
If you get the fishing capabilities, you get to create potential to create potentially fear.
It leads to more disrupes and less peacified and less peacement.
Everybody has a fish.
This is freeze certainly constrained -- possibly even for the fish, but certainly for us.
But the decreatures of a figures to be questions to reach miserable, compartment, dispary, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
