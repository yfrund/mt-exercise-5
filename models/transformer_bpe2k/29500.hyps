Last year, I showed these two dias, to show that the Poice capture of the pool, who had about the past three million years about the size of the United States, with 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the nice of this specific problem because it doesn't show the didness of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice heap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, is the slump heart of our global climate system.
It's in the summer, and it's crimping in the summer.
The next slide that I shot is a accelerated version of what happened the last 25 years of what happened to be happened in the last 25 years of happened
The permanently premanently in red.
As you can see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the annual ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called o-mine, five years older, is almost like flower, is almost like flower, which is taken out of the bodies here.
In 25 years of this is what this stuff to this up.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen ground of the Northern Icell warming and there is a very large amount of carbon on a very large amount of carbon the major of carbon methane.
Commandments with the total amount of disconnection in the atmosphere, that could double that can double the amount of the entire re-described the amount of the entire amount of display if we disagree if we divide the amount of ath, that could be double to be double the amount of the atmosphere, that could dou
In some undeep deep mind mes, in Alaska sign of methane in the water.
Again, the past winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another ondeep to a different team to a different undeep there.
Why! She's OK. The question is to be right.
A reason for that, is that this massive warm-wider Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of wire is wrong up.
This is a meltwo-atriver.
The water volume is a bigger than eye is a bigger than eye
This is the Kangerlussuac river, in South Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea soaxy because it lands melt, then this is the place where it comes in the sea.
These flow are taking flow across it.
On the other side of the planet, on the South Pole, the greatest ice mass on Earth.
As last month reporteaching scientists that the entire continent now a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly to the South Pole is melting,
The whole continent, the whole continent, sea so-foot stying, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after largest ice ice ice mass ice mass of a few years ago, who were still glaciers were still glaciers were still in the Himal's
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water of that meltic time.
In the Andes, is this glester the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more stroms.
But when they disappearing the drink of the drink water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water reservoires.
And as you could read the predictions are requires that are almost of it.
This global dreamong the dream of a dramatical stying,
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen across the speed.
Four times more in the last 30 years than in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely unkeep intention,
If you look at the bottom from a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 tons of CO2 every 24 hours.
25 mios of ton every day in our oceans, look at the eye area of the Stille Ocean, and in each side, and in each side, and each side, and every single side, there is a drastic dalation of the Indian excited.
The only great cause of the global warming of the Earth, is to deforest, which is burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Olie is a problem, and steengineering is the most largest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest excites, together with China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more urban centrales.
But we see a cirmacle.
These are the stenches centrales that the bitself was annual in the last years, and where green alternatives were forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget away to have form in the last years,
There is a political fighting in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industry gave form of 250 million dollars to promote "clean empty coal of coal coal of cool.
And that picture was what happened to me to think about something
And I was the Churstmas there was in Tennessee, about four billion literacy parenched bone carbon model.
You probably have the likely in the news of news.
This is the one after largest way.
This was happening around the Kerst.
One of the advertisements of the supply cooking was the Kerstront of the Kerstront of the Kerster was

We need to go far and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year, I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am here -- I am not there were not going to be the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever entered 27 miles in the engineering of 27 miles in the end.
It has to be the circumstances that were attacking less than a billions of second after the universe began to be 600 million times a second of the universe began to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, so.
This is the machine under Genee.
We took pictures of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors and and this is the one where I work with the ATLASS, detector -- 44 meter -- 44 meter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in attracular, so you can see the scale.
And at 10 September 10, we put the machine for the first time.
This photo became taken by ATLAS.
And that causes a partness in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that was all around the LHC went around the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which in which the detector in the detector of the LHC.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine working on the machine, which is a huge over.
I don't know if this the largest acut, or this thing was going to get to Google and then went to Google and saw that the Internet page there.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact as a scientific impact.
And one week later, we had a problem with the machine, what to do with these golden drams.
And those behaviors ago, 13 thousand amper when the machine on the entire power.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small drad."
They can do that because they can because they are superago.
So on minus 27, colder than the space between the stars, that can be able to have a bunch of the behaviors that flow power to the beach.
In one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive away in the LHC, was a constructive in one of the nine of the next.
And it was going to be something warmer, and it was an electric resistance against that 13 thousand ampe-by-by-resistance resistance.
This was the result.
This is still impressive if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of the road, and they were about 30 inches were moved about 30 inches.
We had to do about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of what we did to do.
We all have them when we all repairs.
Now they're road.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We're going to put it back back and we expect measures in juni or to figure out what the building building blocks of the universe.
Now, of course, who have been able to reincidents the debate re-incidents the value of scientific research to research to be working on the value.
I think it's facing that it's a fact that it's a fact that we go beyond than the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would have to dead the deavy, I would have been doing his student, his level, his leverage was Michael Faraellowly to the progresing of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of science of science definition of science definitive, that there are not a mysteries in the nature, and that there are not a new world of nature's re, and that there are not a new world of the re, and that there are not a mysterifies'
Thank!
I would like to start to ask you back to your child's time when you played with blocks.
When you discovered how to grab it up and conscious, and I was going to take a problem to solve the problems of the engineering with and hanging hanging from space relations.
Ruintely insight is because with understanding the world to understand of the world to us
If a information of information that inspired by the nut of the interaction with objects -- together with objects -- together with my adviser Pattion and my compassion, I started to ask Jeed. I started to ask -- what if we could use a computer to ask -- what if we would use a computer that environment to a kind of digital finger like a glow-regular blad, what they could rebad to a plate and we cattacheice.
and ordering as we want to do it?
And these question was so so that we decided to find an answer to find an answer by building Siftables.
Sort together is a Siftable computer size a computer size of a cow of a cotttable computer
They can be moved, they can put together and they can feel detect and they can detect a share, and they have a screen and wireless contact.
The nuclear understanding is the physical treatment is just like blocks can they get to grab up by the grab.
And the other thing dies are Siftables a new ecosystem for the manipulate of digital information.
And then this aid resources have a more physical differentirely of their movement and from each other, and even of the way we move them are moving to find different new and nice interactions.
And I will start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is to tell a video to tell a video that plays by the size of the opportunity and others and others are playing and others played the other thing is playing it.
These interactive portraits of each other of each other.
Indians as to each each each one to each other.
If they are surround, they can also be surface and what nerves.
And they move motion and hind movement.
We realized algaug that one of the interesting consequence of this interaction, the use of all, the use of all, as it excited, as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the interesting of a color as it was a fluid of the interesting of this interaction, and we
In this example are three Siftables left to go and I can use them to go color in a spot to go and go into a spring.
And if we have over-threat, we went back a little bit back.
There are some of the critical cross-education, mathematical and mathematics and mathematics and logics that we want to give people the possibility to explain the outcome of the things quickly immediately quickly except to see the result immediately gone.
Here's a line of this is a Fibonacci acci account by a simple programmate.
Here we show a game that a game between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Siftable, and you get out of any Siftable, and shaped words are being controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds is really rescued and appropriate a new series of letters with a bad-similar possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I'm sleeping them out and I slept them out and make a video of it.
They were really away.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people needed almost not needed instructions of this approximately needed to have instructions of this application is that people needed almost interesting things of this application of the most interesting things of this applications of the most interesting things of the most interesting things of this is that people don't
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are some other people to test the test of the test of the other people.
That's our youngest ber right board, right?
And it turns out he only cattables well,
For him were only blocks.
Here's a interactive paintings a couple of paint.
We wanted to develop a platform for learning language of language
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate it.
He can bring new characters in the scene, by just the Siftable with that characters of the table with that carakter's of the table.
Here's he let the sun emerge.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good mind of the thought! Yeah!
And by Siftables and the needle of Siftables and the needle to respond to each one -- Video: Wor!
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to deal with it.
Video: The cat fly.
DM: The last example I will show you Is a synthesizer and live music child is a synthesizer and lives, where every Siftables a sound produces a sound of the lead, bass and drum.
Eender has four different variations that you can choose what you want to use what you want.
These luckields can be injected in the way so you can be injected so you can determine the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern Siftables in the pattern Siftables can be injected in the pattern itself in the pattern itself
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a touching Siftable effects of available effects of available, and filter.
They are getting a sound and added by the office.
In the general effects like tempo and volume that are being accross the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern on the entire pattern to the entire pattern of the pattern of the pattern of the entire pattern of the pattern of the entire pattern of
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We put a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern by an extra lead.
Now, I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now, I add some beat.
Video: And now I copy the movie on the presses, so I can affect the effect living.
Video: I can cut it very accelerate by the size of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter on the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can rewrote the pattern as it plays the pattern as it plays playing.
So I don't have to planning, but I can improvise it very longer and make it very longer and make a shorter like I want.
In the finally of the dimessage the evolution of the volume Siftable to see the left.
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion, my passion, my passion, my passion, my passion, which are better dested in the way our brains and work work and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area that we have a few possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought that I want to talk about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation of aid to the interacting with digital media, which bring the information to our world as we want to do it to our world as we want to it.
I'm going to be about hard.
I look at them to talk to you to all of you to all of you all the time.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also writing more than that.
My entire life for a long long and I don't think that that will change ever change.
And yet there is unfrequire, in my life and career and career in my relationship with my work to re-re-inflect my work on the work to my work on my work on my work to see my work on the work of my work and career is something that happened to be a re-agone.
It started with a book that I wrote recently written a memoire: "Ext, Bids, Beminnera that very extremely contrasing to my first thing and went on and a international exister celler.
And the consequence is that people have to pull me as if I am always telling me as if I do job.
And that is what -- gets do!
People come to me and ask to me and ask questions, "Are you never going to equare?
Are you not afraid you will continue to write your entire life but never going to be published a book of people will write for warm.
Don't you get there?"
Frg representation, you know.
Of course, that would be very very often that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I was a teenager, if I told I want to become writer.
People said, "Don't you get success you've never been going to get succes?
Don't you get to refrigaring to yourself in the way to do you will go to you?
Don't you imagine your life on this work without any of this work without there anything from the prevent to the puin of your broken on the puin of your broken with your mouth with your mouth as of fail?"
And one of those streets.
In the short, my answer to that questions to this questions to this is "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid for all those things that are called all those things that are called
All of the time.
But I also am also for a lot of other things job, you don't know what to do.
For example, for example, and other engineers.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time when you get to the last time that comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is being a failed to work for working for the work for the work for their earth to their opinion.
What is so particular to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind-system, something what happens to be something to happen to others don't extend work doesn't happen.
Take my father. He was a chemists engineer, and I can't remember that there was a guy for a 40 years he ever asked somebody ever asked to him if he was not afraid to him if he was not afraid to him that he was not afraid for a little bit of it.
And so of that, "Yohn, how did it with your chemblocks.
No, so there was not talking about it.
And to be fair to be fair engineers have been by the centuries by the centuries and they don't have the reputation for piece of manic-depressive alcoholists.
Scheates, who have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writers, also other creative people have been working on the reputation of people, instable.
but you look at the grim of the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many died you, often young by own.
And even those who don't even the suicide of suicide to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gavents to be under their gave suicided to be under their gave to be under their gave suicicide who don't
In the last interview for his dead Norman Mailer: "Don't each of my books is a little bit of myself."
That's pretty much to say about your life.
But of this kind of excited, we don't look at it.
We all heard the first of alls and spent it with all accepted.
The reason the way is that creativity is that creativity included to suffering with suffering and that a artstone will lead to missing the artist-existence is going to lead to missing the entirely to reflect the suffer.
So that's why I want to ask everyone here today to be living to live with that idea of life?
Do you have that OK?
Because now I think about it, I think about it, I don't think it's completely a little thought.
I find the resisted to the resistance.
And even even more dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century, this is also so on.
We can creative spiring a lot better more than to live in.
I know certain that situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to live to that dark to that dark in the dark of it.
In fact, the failumbers that my career is now in the face.
Go took only you, I'm still young aman among a saving.
I can spent a four decades.
Heeme-stify everything I will be now to be published by the outside of the outside of the work that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can probably explore it to you think about my greatest success for me.
Yeah. What a idea!
If you think about this, you know, is what you know is to the morning to take negord for negorged to the vack.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love to the work that I love of work.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after a long time I think I am to the conclusion that I can only go to write with writing a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the conclusion of the conclusion,
I have to write the write of creating a safe distance between myself and my consider to create the very understanding of the reactional published published published published to the reactions.
I was looking for the last year to ways to do that.
And I am in history and I do in the history and deep me in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to help creative people to help creative process.
My search for me has been brought me to the old Greeks and Romend.
Let me because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greek and Rombits were not creativity of them was from herrself.
And they believed that creativity was a goddle-crowd, unknown place to the human beings across the human fingers.
The Greeks called these calls called creativity "demonen."
And Socrate beliefed that he had a demon that he was a demon that we were able to fluist.
The Romen's Roman had a species of the same idea.
In fact, in them was a genious creative minds.
The funny is that the Roman with a genius with a genius to be a particular piently.
In their policy was a genius was a kind of magical godd-entitt that that was in the walls of the artst.
A little bit like Dobby the house.
If the artistic was working on the genius assisting.
And he gave the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the earlier across the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was going to be in his work
The artistic was so in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant, you didn't get all the one.
Everybody knew that a knew that a invisible genius had helped genius to help
Where's what you do is crazy, you know, that not just to you.
Everybody knew you had a rather independent genion.
Lange time is that had been considered how in the West creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed.
There was a very new idea: the individual ments is the resource of the universe is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, ancrows.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individuals.
And for the first time in history was there about artists there was a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they had a genius were not to have a geniius and not that they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius and not that they were a genius were not to say that they had a genius.
I have to say that I find a big mistake.
And to let one person, one single individual to believe that he or she is the essential of the century of the century of all of the eternal mystery, creative and the known preservation of everything -- that's too much responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
And if you ask somebody asks the sun into it.
Egos are read to gigantic proportions and there are improportions to prestensible expectations to be copposed to perform period of expectances are resisted to proportions.
And I think this drug has made a lot of artists have made a lot of artists of artists of artists
And if that's so on, and I think, is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this differently.
Can we return on an older understanding of the relationship between the human beings and creative mysterile?
Maybe not maybe not.
We can't make 500 years we can rational hmanism not uncomfortable in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes to do a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes to do not uncompared to make 500 years of well.
And probably suspected in the audience of scientific people who have refell about the idea that elfro-like reads with some feet of the partments of artists to inspiring the work of artists.
It doesn't seem to me get you in that I will get to you.
And yet, I ask it me.
Why doesn't it?
Why wouldn't we do not to do that though?
And it fell as much as well, as much as well, as all the other explanations of the totally calculate that are including in the creative process.
And everybody who have to try to create something -- so in fact, all the attackaged all the attacks -- you know, that the creative process is not always rational across rational process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process is not always rational process -- you know, that the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process to create rational process -- so in fact,
And that sometimes it took almost paranormal.
I have been across the great American closer.
And she is a deal in the nine. Her entire life already writing.
She told me about her childhood on the planning of Virginia.
Some of them when she was fell on the work was felt to the work on the country.
It was so said, as if there was a big wave air came air came out of air came out of the air
And so close wave than the country.
She felt that the ground began to shug her at that time, but one thing to do was to do was just to do one thing to be to her life.
She ran home, and she was following by the poem and then they had to see paper and paper and paper to see paper and paper
When the poem was close by her hand her only was her only chance to write it on the only opportunity to write it on the hundred of writing.
Sometimes she wasn't quickly enough.
Then they ran and ran aw't catch the house.
And at these moments are poem by her him, sappear to search -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poet.
And even though there were even even though I find the most of the story -- that they were the close to almost of the story -- that they close the close to me.
And then she was looking for paper and paper and paper the paper by her him by her him.
Jue at that time, she had a potleft to a potledge of it.
And with her other hand, so she told me she told me she was the close of the air.
She paked the close to his tail and it back into her body, while she was going to wrote it back the bate.
And in that cases came up to the well-well-up what is really in the paper and then it was followed holds.
When I heard that -- I thought -- what I thought -- what is accidently, my creative process ey!
And this is what my creative process! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which every day on the same time on the same time and exists with flower, sweand then trans and spent it gets up.
But even in that day. I had this experience a had such a experience of experience.
You will also know it to know it yourself that feeling that there is a creative ideas in your released from a source that you can identify impossible.
What is that a brone?
How can we use it without a lot of the one?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is a musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had this about this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life has been a great part of his life has been shown to get from the crazy argue that is trying to get to get to grip on the unconservable creative impulses in him.
And with the years, Tom what was rustly in the 1980s.
And one day he reach in Los Angeles about the freeway the faith, and changed the process of radical.
And as he heard about that, he heard a fragmentary of a melodie.
The decider is a decequipment that is crazy, crop, catch, catch, catch, calling.
It was a beautiful melody and he wanted to fashion the wall.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have a paper at a page, no paper to the taperecorder to see a taperecorder to see a a taneously.
The well-known exciting back to the melodic regular adic heaves, and then it stays to me eternrified.
I'm not good enough, I can't be it."
He didn't get a little bit not panick, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the air and said, "Sorry hear, can you see that I sat the air and said, "Sorry about the air?"
"Do you really think I can now write a song nowrit?
If you really want to get that this song later, you have to take a little bit of the time for you.
And not, not, anybody else falls.
Go neighborhood's neighborhood's neighborhood's really, really different.
The work is even the same thing to do with the except of the dark of the substance of today.
But the heavy spanning that creative process in him excited to him up the genius when he distant distance of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius
The genius was to close to the skin and supply just just up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go on the bottom to go on the bottom to go to the ordinary.
It could also be a wonderful, bizarre collaborative between Tom and the ownership of Tom and the ownership of Tom itself.
And that story has changed my way of works.
I had already profit from it.
I was in the middle of Exxxxual process of Exxxt.
And at a pointancy point.
You know that you don't want to do you to walk and you don't think it's a terrible disagreement is getting a horrible book it.
Not just just a bad really bad really bad bad to bad it.
I wanted to do all the project.
And then I remember Tom that are reminded to his genius who are going to be able to way.
I was going to get me from my manuscrips and focused crip, to me to a empty of the room.
And I said, "Lister thing, we know everything that if this book is not just to me. And then that's not only about me.
You can see that I have to get everything in what I have in me.
I can't give you to it.
If you find that it better opportunity, you have to get your thing.
Do you don't have that you, you can't do that, you've thank you.
I just write because that's what my work.
Oh, and in the notils are being seen to be solid that is just apparent."
Tja--- Uso. First, it's going to be able to get this down.
Every single came together in the North African desert people together to dance in months to dance in a malight on the sacred music.
Ors and hours and hours, to the morning lighting.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, happened to be something extraordinary --
One of those dansers was transcendent.
You know what I mean, you have ever seen with that you ever have ever seen something like a performer.
It was as if the time was stilsted and the dancer by a purchase.
He didn't do anything else than the thousands of nights and now crows.
And suddenly he didn't just just a human beings a human beings a human beings.
In him, under him above him blowed it glorious it.
A goddless across him.
And if something happened to be able to kill people what it was Dan she started to clah, and crop in the clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was for them.
By the way, a fun historic fact: When the Moren South South Spain South Spain this usual habiting with it.
The outcome is the requency by the centuries of the centuries of "Allah" in "Allah" in "Ooh, OK, oh, oh, okay, o."
And that is your hearing today at the day at today and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artest in Spain something impossible, or magically, you roped people, ot, "Allah, oil oil One, Allah, great, well, great, fell right."
Actually, a disease, a God.
Precions what we need.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the next morning to the next morning to discover 11 in the morning of 11 in the morning of 11 in the morning of a didle laddd-sized laddd-up ladd-up on dinary laddddly to
And at that time, he is again, a little parent guy with deavy who may never have been able to get more to such a such of parent.
Maybe there will never be anybody else to have a little bit of the dance.
What does he have to be able to live with the rest of his life?
That's hard to be difficult.
And that's really difficult to a creative mind.
But it doesn't need to be not need to be too to be not needed to be there.
Imagine if you don't know about it to extend aspects of your person from your person from your person from you.
Imagine that you believe that you have a while, you knowledge from a not to specific source.
When you ready it, they are giving to somebody else.
And so it turns everything.
I hang in the average that thought of the thought of the thought of it.
And the last months I've been working on a book that will be short to be a lot of a long time to go to excited.
The reflective of that illuster progress.
And if my thoughts with me to the hall, I like to go and I always remember, don't know very much the same one.
Do just you work you work.
So if you just do thing you do about what it is.
If you are too dance you go.
If the godd-heavy genius decide to decide in your work at some moment of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful genius is to make a godd-time genim of the wonderful genim that you have to do something
As nother not thank you just go.
And then said, "Oly!"
I believe that I believe of heart.
"Oly!"Well, anyway, because we have pure human love and propertly, by the pure of human love and propertly,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about a few of these projects, about some of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean, and discover of new sets of genes.
We actually started from a new point: we were the biology to the digital issue, and now we are trying to go from that digital code to a new phase to a new phase in the biology and synthetthesize the design and synthetthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions
"What is life?" is something that I think have been trying to understand the too understand in different levels of biologists have been trying to understand the whole thing that has been trying to understand the too different levels.
We tried different approaches to minimal approaches to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to digitize the digitizing of digitizing it.
When we have the human genome of the human genome of the biology, went from the analoge world of the biology world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life to regenerate life to regenerate new life from this digital universe?
This is the card of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can multiply himself in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can come to a nature smaller genome can come up to a nature of genome
We can go in the order of hundred of genes out of the 500 or something, which are there.
But if we look at the metabolic map, is that relatively compared to the unset.
Gelore me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can extend to extend is it to be very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell cell.
And we decided to do that the only route condition was to synthesizing this chromosome of the components so that we could provide the components to make the components to make the present questions.
And so we started to ask questions like to say, "Can we have a chromosome of a chromosome of the chromosome of the thing?"
Stakes the chemistry to make this very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we can do that, if we can a chromosome of "restart."
A chromosome is just a little bit of the way, but a little chemical include material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelated on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code rather slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly of the cross-supply.
And our last point it would put on this moment in a moment,
We're more than 15 years ago.
There were some stages, a number of stage for a bio-ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is really difficult is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult it.
There are teends of thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length of DNA degenerative process, so how longer you make the longer you make it piece of the world that are going to be a little bit more fals.
So we had to make a new method for the little pieces and correct the corrigate of all the mistaks.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, we did the foutcome
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part started when we put a little piece of chemical chemician stant chemician and the bacteria of the genetic code and virtually went to make viral particles and make virtually gges.
The viral particles were reseced from the cells, they came back and then they came back and they were back and they were E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they are too well.
They laugh more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation in which the software can build its own hardware building in a biological system.
But we want to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the complete bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the bacterial chromosome of the bacterial bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial chromosome of the entire bacterial of the complete bacterial ch
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetts in cassetts so we could vary the cassettes variety of various --
to understand what the influence is to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than to the computer than that digital information is very accuraff is very accura.
When we first to this genome for the first time was the default was the default of one mistakes a 10,000 basepares.
And eventually we found after resequencing 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence of the sequence of it was not going to start to starting to start.
And the design of the design of pieces that are about 50 letters that are long that are going to have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build sodos that we need to design so that they can design together.
We design here unique parts in this way.
Maybe you have read water that we put water in the watermarks.
Bethink we have a four--letter genetic cod: A, C, G, C, G, Go and T.
Trios of those cows for ruwway for 20 aminozurs -- that there is a very one-aspire for every aminoxxygen oxxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, so.
And at the anvanly we just assumed it.
Some of them were crazy that there were no poems.
We have designed these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with anzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairs and put together in each other.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were five to 7,000 letters long and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, you take a 24,000 letter, then sets of 24,000 letter, to 7,000.
In every dium of the stage of these pieces so we could sequence them because we could create them because we want to create a process that very robust is that will be very robustic -- that will be very robuying to sex them to sequence them to sequence.
We're trying to cover the point of automatisation
So this looks like a basketbalfinal finale.
And as we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow so much more than 100,000 baseparts of E. coli.
And that is the expanded of all modern tools of the molecular biology
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-o-o-o-of-o-odddness to repair DNA to repair and to repair that can add together.
Here's an example of it.
There is an organism called Deinoccus radiodurans, that three million radiation of radiation to can.
And that is that in the top panel, sheat the top panel, just sheat is just from one another.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it back back to each other, as the first of all,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this art.
These organisms can be dry dressed to be dry.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely absolutely life can promove to move the space that can find to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of them, there are lots of there.
Here's a very interesting microph of the molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually with these processes -- actually actually just yester-mechanisms with the right design of the stuff that we were in them.
And it turns out to it automatically brought to give them automatic.
This is not electronen-microscope photo; this is a microscope.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are pictures, taken about a period of six seconds.
This is the auication that we exbrincluded up
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule ever made by people, with a clear, with a clear.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages just to present the genetic code on the genetic code down.
All right, how do we started to go a chromosome of the activit?
And with a virus is it clear to be clear.
And with a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you a cell of eukaryots, like we just wear the cell and does another in, and that's what you know as it was reading as it clons.
In the bacteria species of the cell, is integrated in the cell, but we have recently showing that we can explain a full transpllant of a chromosome of the transplant to a chromosome of a cell to another and it can activate the activity.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microromosome species.
These are about as far from each other as people and mics.
We added some extra gene to this chromosome of the chromosome selecters.
We have the response to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the proted.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will put the very avanced graph here -- the new chromosome of them -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to so. But we tried to develop the process of what beyond to develop the process of what beyond to develop the process of what would be going to come out of what would come out of what would come out of what would come out of what would come out.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of them or a third chromosome of ownerships in one time, they add thousands of owning in one time,
People who are not evolving evolution as if there are not a lot of biology changed that have no longer biology have been embedded not a lot of biology changed to be a lot of biology as if you have one changed to have a lot of biology as if you have one changed to be a lot of biology that are going to be a lot of biology as if you have one of them who are not a lot of biology as if you have one has been a lot of biology to proposed to proposed to preventifounded up
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes are called DNA restriction of DNA device.
The chromosome was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome of them -- well, we put it -- well,
It was express and it was express the other chromosome of the other chromosome as strange of material, and so far it was so far, just to the new chromosome of the new chromosome of chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the new chromosome of the foundly as a strange of material, and so it was express the new chromosome of the new chromosome of materi
He was blue because of the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time all the characterists of all the characterists of the one species, and changed he completely in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein changed the membranes changed -- when we changed the genetic code was changed.
This is a magine as a genomic alchemistry, but we are in changing the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
All right, I've been paid earlier before, this is not a creation of a creation of the Camban explosic entire to 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid that we may have almost a new version of the Camban explosic engineer, based on this digital design.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clearly obviously if you look at what is needed is.
We're going to go in six-and-a-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to put it in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 1946; within 40 years, that there are four are going to be four are going to be four there.
We have trouble to food, with the heavy of clean medicine, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
And that's being hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of collapsed over 30 billion of ves;
That's 100 milos of vese.
When we take biological processes in ogency or any process than also to replace that a process than also going to be a huge challenge of challenge of day.
Then there is all the carbon dioxide of the stor that comes in the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere is a term of the stunning atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere is going to be in the atmosphere is all the carbon dioxide all the carbon dioxide all the carbon dioxide all of the atmosphere.
And by all our global discoveries we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and that I'd like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had only a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that has come out of there.
We're precedency by a biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques of gricultural methods to do so-called combination genomics to do so-called combination genomics.
We've now got the opportunity to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day of a day.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or trying to optimalizing processes to optimalization or to produce octane; new vaccines, new vaccins, we can change with a small team than in the last 20 years, then we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for livaccine, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccine, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real designs is where we work on the geese and so you can actually go to the crowd and a new kind of on the computer on the computer on the computer on the computer of the computer on the computer of the computer of what we do about the computer in the computer of the computer of what we do is a new kind of a new kind of a screen of a new kind of a new kind of straight of a little bit of a new kind of a new kind of of of on the computer of on the computer of a new kind of a new kind of on the computer of on the computer of on the computer
We don't know how it will look at it.
We know exactly how their genetic code from exactly how their genetic code from it.
We focus on fourth generation of fuel of fuel of fuel of fuels.
Anolangs have seen to ethanol of ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation of fuel that will come out of sugar to more high-digniter fuels like environments like octano.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have a big influence of food, and to make the availability to reduce the availability to reduce the CO2 as his food, and that's why we are now now to design that we are the first fourth generation of fuels to have the first fourth generation of fuel and inside about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- -- -- but by our world -- -- but by our world we have all kinds of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the depth of the depth of a half miles deep with celling temperatures.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water water in the environment.
We're looking at whether we can take CO2 that we can be able to be pipilites in that can be forward to face that CO2 to five to fuel to the fuel to fix this process.
So in a short time to think we are able to think we are able to expanding on the basal question: "What is life?"
We actually have real, you know -- you know, the protect the petrochemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where you can't do this, where then you can't do this at TED
A major energy source is getting a big energy source.
But we also work now to use these tools to think about quickly servaccines.
This year, there was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts of the facts when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can change by creating the combine of temptation vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see through the evolution tree, the evolution tree, the evolution is now changes, the evolution with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still awful away of improving people.
Our goal is to be able to survive that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive to do that probably well. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a first quickly is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you can local or on the distance with immense amounts of visual data can work in visual data that you can work out.
We look at this time, we look at digital images and can be able to stay in this way-in--- and excited, and excited, and excited, and the sorts of our wishs.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how big information, or are the images or images or images are of the collections or images.
Most of this normal digital camera pictures, but this is a scan of the Library of the Library of Congresss, and is in the 300 megapixel of the Library of the Library of the Librance of the Library of them are a scan of the Library of them are a scan
It all makes nothing out because it only only thing that would influence to a concerned on a system pixels on a screen on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, a that's a completely book,
This is the graduate of Dickens. Every colute is a chapter of chapter --
And to prove that it's really really text, and not a imagination, and not a imagination, we can do something to do is really textest to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit strange of strange way to read.
I wouldn't add it it to me.
This is a realistic example. This is a very of The Guardian.
Every big image the beginning of a submersion.
This is really a real paper and the experience of a real paper papers of a real paper of a real paper medium is.
We also have done something to the corner of this excited.
We made a np advertising of high resolution -- much higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information of information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can actually do the limitations of hands through the screen to do the screen to do the screen to do the screen
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other things that is not going to be more flaw -- not needed to be more than it will be more usual flaw -- not needed to be more pop-ups and other supposed to be more pop-ups and other things that is not needed up and other supply that this is not needed up to be more pop-ups and other such a lot of flaul of the flawwell.
Of course are amazing for a technology of the engineering for a technology like this, I will not spend here to spend here to this fields to this fields to this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on the top of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now to live on the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which connects two techniques together.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, promogresation of Washington, promogresing by Steve Seitzton,
and Rick Sselfiski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's been made by Seadragon.
When we do this do, you see that we experience through the images of divice, and the multi-resolution.
The space shiking of the images of the images is here is meaning her.
The computer vision algorithms have brought these images together to the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- where they are genomes -- where they are genomes of stabilized diassions of stabilized diassions are space.
I don't know sure whether there is other environments.
There are still a lot of space for a lot of space.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from a early prototypical of Photosynthesses -- to the communicate what I have in my head is the reality -- to the communicate is the reality of the environments of this technique of this techniques on our website.
We had to response to account and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images of Flickr. You just look for images from Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in the shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get images of people in Flickr.
And each of these orange chain a picture that was a picture of this model of this model turns out to be part of this model of this model turns out to be part of this model of this model --
And so all these Flickr images, which are copaged in this way.
And we can reflect to a simple way to deal of the wall.
You know, I never thought I would never work.
It's overwhelming here is to be so exactly to be so exactly there.
I believe you can see that this is a lot of cameras, all of the guns of mirror reflexcameras, a big number of it, concluded in this environment.
And I will try to find some strange images
There are so much more covered by facing faces and things like that.
And somewhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are there.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is also choended by the program.
If we dive the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, this is now the data of the entire of the entire collective memory of how to see on the so.
All these pictures are reflected together and form together a very little bigger than the sharing of the parts.
You've got a model that from the entire Earth is being being in the entire Earth
So this as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Acth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they used to use the benefits of the benefits of the people who use it.
Their own pictures are being able to see metap?
If anybody would like to clip and their names and inputs their names and their names is going to be agree-agree Dame is require to all the data, and I can use as a access to that space, that metap-versus of photos, and create that metap-sized social experience.
And of course, is the be-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place of any interesting place on Earth, who not only photos, satellite images and other applications is excitements is uncrazy.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Have I understood that what makes your software possible, in the next years, all the images that are going to be dealed by everybody on the world can copy?
BA: Yeah. What this really is discovered.
It creates, to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that on the base of the data in the images.
And that is being a recently exciting when you think about the richchchales of semantic information that are protected.
When you look for imagine, you know, you find a search in the web, and the text on the webber page of information about what the imagination.
What if you have this image copaged to all your image?
And then the number of semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes out of that, it's a classic network effect. It's a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitated.
One of the intense pleased of travels and of eating research is the possibility to live between those who are not forgotten the old habiting habiting in the wind, who are not forgotten in the wind, the touchest sting in the wind, profitting in the wind, profiters.
The science that Jaguars still traveling the Milky galaxy or that the mythes of Inexcited.
the consequence of a fun set of a fun choices that made our ancestors of generations ago.
Of course, we all parts of the same requires of requires in the world. Breng children in the world. Breng children in the world.
We all make induction to all invition.
Because of the inamazing diaxed by the death.
So it can't be surprising to be all of six, dancing and arts art.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song and the rhythm of the dans in every different culture.
Or now is about the Penan in the Borneo, or the Vood-Carai or the United Ars in Haiti or the fight-hand west in North Kaisut-de-and-and-ai in the Andess-building or the Caravanahara. This is the guy with the Sahara. This is the guy with the desert of the Sahara. Wor, or a ma, or now, a main the requiregmberta of Quacolunning of Quacle
Everest, the godinary of the world.
They all us learn us that we can be able to think different, we can think of oriens.
If you think about it, you can just give this idea of the idea of you just hope.
Samen the intelliligenous cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet is enterrible as the biological life webb: the biosphere.
This cultural life web you can imagine as a enosperate of an enosphere.
The foot of equivalent if the totally the totally of all the thought, myths, dreams, myths, inspirations and intuitions and intuitions that are previous by the human imagination.
The equal nation's big nality of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as amazing newsative species.
And not as the biosphere is a tool, is the equipment that it -- and even in much larger mate.
No biologist, no biologist, you know, the least half of all species of all species on the point of all species on the point, because that's not true.
And the most apocalyptic scenario is not even in the neighborhood, not even in the neighborhood,
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is losing to languages.
And when everybody was born to this is born six-thousand languages,
A language is more than her words or her gramatic rules.
A language is a coverage,
It's the vehicle that is the soul of every unique culture the material world to reach the material world.
Every language is a century of a century wold, a dishep, an ecosystem to spiritual potential possibilities.
And from that six-thousand becomes the day of the day is not more in child's refluist.
They are not longer test babies longer touched
Effective means that unless a change, unless a change, that they are dead.
Is there something like to be helped by the stilt, the last of your people, the last of your people, you know, no opportunity of your people, no opportunity of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children's children's to see the promise of the children?
And the reciient of the face of somewhere on the Earth, because every two weeks and every two weeks and dying it a parent and with him in the last letter and with him in a old language of an old language of an old language of an old language of an old language of it is a parent.
Some of you say, "Super, won't the world better place if we all all the same language if we all all the same language of the same language. Or Kantone: "Super, do we take Yoruba tape.
Or Kogi.' ' You will realize how it would be not speaking your own language.
So what I want to do is to take you on a short on a short of the enos-foot that has to be a picture of what to actually scree a picture of what I actually lost a quick of what I want to do is to be lost a short of what I really want to be lost today.
And many of us that when I have to be able to say that when I have a different way of being in a different ways.
For example, this Barasana-child in the North Amazone, the people of the anaconda, that believe that she believe that she believe that she believe that she felt floor, from the bubble.

One of the fascinerate stem that I removed with which I removed the Waorani in North Ecust-Ecute a amazing blowly in 1958 freedom.
In 1957, five missions, five missions, but they made a critical mistake.

They were getting the pictures on and trying to find the shape the face.

This picture I have to the northern point of Baffin Island taken up with Inextly in the Inextly narwal ys.
This guy, Olays, Olayer told me a wonderful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextinct. In the 1950s, to reflect our souple of the end-settments.
The opa of Olayer refused to go.
The family peace for his life and determine him already his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Inuit not afraid for the col; they used to use of it.
The glions of their bads, the original car in fish crossed fish in kill.
Olayers, the opa wasn't afraid for the Poile that require.
He went out, he was living his boundaries and poepoepoep, and then the poop began to freeze, he started woman, he started it as a limet.
He spent a little bit of a low-up speekings on the sides of the sides.
And then the solide was a dog of it.
He received the dog and improvised a hearnas.
And from the ribban is he made a bad thing.
He was looking for a dog in the neighborhood, and he was wrong about the ice flake, including ppersops.
And this is not a little nothing to do about it. And this, in many ways, is symbol for the resisting of the Inin and all the inside of the world.
In april 19999, the Canadian government of the inuit of a piece of country greater than California and Texas sams our new home.
It's independent on the ground of the ground stone.

And finally, I think it's clearly to think it's clear, at least for who is the way to these high is required, that they don't actually get far away.
They're somebody else home country.
They are going to be to the human imagination, which are going to go back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, will be the dreams of these children, like the unconcerned of a bunch of hope.

Maybe you see paralls with information of other sources.
I also try to explain some sense of the connections that you may have a memist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society, iny industrialized society.
And that official dogma is awful as a follow-of-free of our citizens, to get to the most level of our citizens, we need to give them so much individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good good good at the human beings of the human beings of human being.
And inclues free is free to acting a higher well-of-frequires without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically means more well-well-of-of-freedomatically means more wells of the wells of well-well-well-well-of-of-freedomatically means.
This is so deep getting in our society that no one would reduce to be reported to be able to pull in our society that no one would be removed in our society that no one would be removed in our society that nobody would be repeak in our society that no one would be deep in our society that no one would be
And in our life is doing this dogma urban ax.
And I will give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A resources.
Even about dressings.
Narrate 175 size classes threats are in my supermarket teachs different brands of extra-virgin oil and twell different balance of balance balance balancy of the balances of the engineers.
And then you can make a tiny of the case between 175 species for you in the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the attacked of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can get your stereoset -- awards -- awards care of cassetttesple -- cassetttesple --
And in that one electronics you can choose from this tap.
You can have a million different systems together in the store.
For you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for a long time, you could all sorry telephone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You hold it it up. You didn't bough. You didn't bought it.
And that had the same before it never been the advantage that it never happened.
That time is forb.
By the gendictable.
And in cell phones is immensive immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is is the middle -- that with the middle -- that with bey-hire brought and cry-brea-of-break fuel brought in the fun of them are going to be able to do it.
And the case of the model is not in the store. And you can't see that that that is going to happen to be able to see that that happens.
The consequence, people come to the store and ask this question.
And you know how the answer to that question question?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of that doesn't do too much does.
And also in aspects of life that are more important than the attack-cident of stuff, is this explosive explosive to a fact of choices a fact of choices a fact.
Gezing health care, it's not in the United States is not that you go to the doctor and you will go to the doctors you have to do what to doctors you have to do
No, you go to the doctter, and you say, "We can do A A or Bow, or we can do Bay to do But, whether we can do But,
As this forward and after that.
BBe has this front of this forwar?"
And you say, "Doktter, what is you find out?
And the doctor says, "A has this front and Badeling this forward and the But, and took this front of the front of this front of the front of this forward.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokty, if you was do?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own including the patient."
And that sounds very position, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision of decide of things -- the doctor of things -- the doctor -- to a life's deadly -- to a decision, and not the best condition to take decisions -- the patient. For on recipatient meetings are being made a lot of regular regular regular regular regullet of regular regular regular reptires of things -- -- the ping -- to a lot of the cluckable to be leassisting of the c
Good considered slaat that nowhere, because the goal's group, you can't buy them.
Why reclame is when we can't copy?
Because they think we are going to think the next morning our doctor to ask that other mark to ask that other mark meets.
Our identity yet a price, the engineering aspect of our existence is now overoveroveroverness to choices like you can see on this slide.
Our identity is is loss of our background.
We find ourselves from -- so we just want to do not often as we just want.
Every morning to the emitting to the opposed to think what person you want to be able to think of what person you want to be able to think of what person you want to be able to think about what person you want to be thinking about what person you want to be able to think what person you want to be able to think for person you want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There is a time that freezes all of everybody went out of it was going to be able to freezing that you can get so quickly to children began to children began to children
The only reality was who was who was who was who was not when and what you did was doing it.
Now is free everything for the opportunity.
I teach to some of them to intelligent students, which I have done less houswork less housing.
They are not dommer or or air than in earlier time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Do I whether or not? Do I now?
Or will I wait? Do I first children, or a care?"
These are all sunred-a-commends.
They go through to them to have an answer, even if this means they don't have to get their homework and then and there no good number stories.
And they have the same life. They're important life.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just to work on that technology is going to work every minute of every minute of every minute of every minute of the world, except in the Randolph Hotel.
There is one place one place, which I love secret that I love the Wii does it.
I don't walk don't true, because I want to keep the place for myself.
But anyway, that we are going to do this huge choices in that we are increasing ourselves on the question of us to work on the road, whether we are going to work or not.
We can look at a football of our son, and we can look at our cell phone, and our Blackbalance on the other side, and our Blackberry.
And even if they all come from straight from that write all of that reads with all kinds of questions, "Am I ask this phone answer?
Am I response? Am I write?
And even if the answer is, we experience the football of our son a very different way.
And what we also look at the great, the big, materialistic things, lives, life is a question of issues.
And so the world used to look like.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of chooses.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad whether bad or bad it?
The answer is "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about is what is going to talk about what is is a bad about it.
And that huge choices has two effects, two negative effects on the human beings on the human beings.
A very contrast effect is that the earlier paralyzed than living beings than living beings
And with so many choice. And they find people the hard to make a choice.
And I give you a very dramatic, you know, a research of investments in volunteer research planns.
A college of me had been access to invest investment data, a great policy of Vanguard, a great policy of a million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 refrigers.
And they found that for every teaching of policies that foundations that are profoundly awful two percent of the took two percent of the took two percent of the departner of the work-awful regular policy of the work-farge-took two percent of police.
In five percent of foundces were able to do 10 percent less employees than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than five than a couple of workers in five than five than five than empty founds.
Because it is to enable to choices so disappead, to choice that people just exactly to the next day, and that on it, and that on it, and so forth.
And of the excited.
That doesn't mean not only that people after their pensionate not just a dream of bread because they don't have enough money to eat because they have not been enough money was so difficult so display was so hard to have a degree of them to shoot the works.
And they were going to have to be 5,000 dollars a year to their nose.
The work--working was willing to double.
So too much choices: so much choice.
And I think the world is what the world looks like this.
If it comes to the century century to make the right choice, right?
You don't want to be reflected with the wrong foundation, or even the wrong three.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing is that we have the lambing of our dish and choose are end, finally less rpeace with the result than the case would be as a result than the case would be as much as we had fewer to have had a fewer options of the result of our disheaves.
There are multiple reasons for to do to do it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, for example, it can seem that the choice was not perfect.
You ask you in this case, for that a different choice would have been better better in the way.
This is dreamed alternative is to get you to get from your choice.
And then does reflect the entire of the choice, even if it was a good choice, even if it was a good choice that was a good choice
The more options are going to be able to easier it is to have unaway from the unaway of the coads of the choices are option.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave all of how often we depend to depend the value of things we depend to the things that we are similar to the value of things we are about it.
If you can include many alternatives you can see a quickly the attractives of all alternatives that you determine your desire that you determine the end.
That makes you fewer peaces with alternative you have chosen a balance of the alternative you have cooperative you've got a cooperent.
A example. For the non-New Yorkers under you: My excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a single of vasions in the Hamptons.
They have a expensive second wound.
They are going to be a wonderful strand. Straland. Straland.
Don't do not it? "Don't cover, "It's audience," "It's audience.
Everybody in my neighborhood, in Manhattan is the city of town.
I could care my car for the door to the door parkers."
And he is about two weeks to the idea that he crives a bad parking place a great parking place place a great parking place place place a great parking place of a great parking place in a case of a great parking place of a great parking place that he crips.
And substitution costs are going to have to have to have our choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there to be more attractivities are there.
And those presents are presenting us as a substitution costs.
Another example of an example.
This image store took about a number of points.
Life in here and now for example, and you don't have to consider things that you have to consider things that you have to consider things that you have to consider.
One is one of the choice other choice other choice other choices
And all that other has been so attractive to the replicate option is being touched option becomes less attractive option is being touched up the callenge of the end.
And third is the escalation of expectances.
I came to this on this for my search for a new breezing new breeze.
I almost always speak is always speaking to it.
And it used to be one kind of stuff was just one kind of stuff, and you didn't care the past. The paste totally unbelievably unbelievably uncomfortable and often enough and often enough and often enough and often enough to be a bunch of the breezing of the breet,
And after years I went to the store for a newlet.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff, this is my me."
And the store said, "Do you smart fit, easy or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Do you want to knows, or a rit?
Do you want to deal with the own-effect?
Wilt you something extend to push or flink extensive pit." And so he was just going on.
I was there to it. And I was a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only breek that used to be a while,
He had no idea what was a little breezing that was and so I have a long hours for all the possible bly engages.
In fact, I was a very fairly explored the store of the wink of a breezing breezed breet.
I could have been doing it better for all this potentially I could do it better.
But I don't felt better.
Why? Because for myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of a book of it.
The reason I don't feel better with all that choice, was that I started expecting to expect to expect of a good spirit.
I started without any any expectancy, because I only know one kind of spirit was a kind of spirit
And then there was different that there were different and one of them would be able to be several perfect.
What I was a good thing I was a good these.
And so I read my bird to my expectancy to me television to me television for me.
The more possibilities of people have been expectations they care more expectations of those possibilities of those possibilities.
And that means that people are less fetpeaces are more comes, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this isn't know?
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
And in real time.
All was better when everything was worse.
Because when everything was bad was bad people could have a little bit of surprising experiences.
In our modern society as well as a well as a well of the citizens, but the best thing we can ever reach is that something so good as we expected.
Nonce we become a surprise, because our expectations, my expectances, are high-up.
The secret of happiness -- this is to be a lot of happiness -- the secret of happiness is not too much expect.
I want to have a little bit -- a car biographic elementary -- that I'm with a woman who is really fantastic elementary --
I haven't assumed her to her less tepeaking to her with less testing.
But with less enough to take his good sides.
And finally, when you get a bad on a bad bad like a bad of the bad if there's only one kind of predicting, you can ask your questions why you are unreflect.
The answer is that case.
The world is responsible. Because you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different available to be a that you buy to fall, and you buy to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer to that is just as simple. That's you.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greenhouse to fail.
So if people decided to decide even if the results of those decisions, they are good-up television about their choice.
And they take themselves quale.
In the Western society clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger of the younger generations of the younger of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger time.
A factor -- not the end, but it's a significant factor in this explosive explosive and self-suicide impression and self-exploit explosive experiencing experiences because of their high explosive experiences because of their high explosive experiences.
And if they try to explain that teleuration for themselves to explain themselves the deal.
So the nettors is that we have been talking about it, but our bad require, but our bads.
Another a contain a contains.
This is the official dogma, that is by everybody is being being available to get to where you get to the one.
But that's not the way it doesn't have it.
It doesn't suffering to choose that can choose better than not cooperiod to be able to choose that more choice is even more choice is even better choice is even better more choice.
There is a magical floor of choices. Well that I don't know.
But I know that we have been more for a long time to the point that choice.
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost finished -- a principle where we can keep the best to do it.
The choices in industrialized countries comes from materialized countries is prevent of material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we already heard about where the problem is not so much choice, but there is too much choice, but there's too few choice.
So the paradox that I speak here is that I speak to the modern, well-to-well-of--well-to-of--well.
That's frustrated, and it's absolutely to installery you've been told you that expensive and distant to installerate kids are not helping your money. Sunt of your money.
And I say you about this pire, complicated choices -- they don't help now: they don't help them focus again.
They make our lives.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all that choices for all of those choices of people have been able to do all options of the people have been from.
And we have to go forward to go forward.
That's what economists a Pareto-improvement.
Everybody is better by reversions from well-of-freement -- not only poor people -- and that comes by the last of choices we are with our our behaviors.
And finally, if you read this image story to say to this image of a sculpture as a developed of this image of fish that fish is there now?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scree imagination, a short squortile -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I thought about it was a better better better I understand that this fish is the same smart is a smart of the fish smart is a smart of the same smart of it.
Because in fact, there is this to the hand: If you get the fish to create opportunities, you don't have a freedom, but don't have freedom.
If you get the fish crossing to create potential to create opportunities.
It lead to more disconnected.
Everybody has a fish of it.
This is free certainly destrokes -- even certainly for us.
But the absolutely of a figurementation of a figure, require, unheavy, unhead.
Thank you for your attention.
