And last year I showed these two dias, I showed that the pools that the pools that the pools had about the past three million years of the vast three million years with 40 percent of the United States with 40 percent of the United States.
But this is actually the first thing that is the most of this specific problem because it not the didness of the ice of ice problem.
The ice heart is in a certain sense, in a sense of the single heart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the winter and crompt in the summer and catched in the summer and sit in the summer and crimpt in the summer and sat the summer and crompt in the summer and sun.
The next slide I shows is a quicted version of what the last 25 years is happening 25 years
The permanently repared in the red.
As you see, it turns out to dark blue.
That's the year, that's the jury of the wish inter.
And the catching in the summer in the summer
The so-called permanent, five years or older, or almost like blood is almost like blood that from the body.
In 25 years of this is this to this in this room.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen around the North Iceless and there are a very big amount of woman, and there's a very big amount of woman, when it was death, when it was death, when it was done in methane.
Consider with the total amount of despending in the atmosphere, that could be able to display as we connect the amount of as we consider the entire describes as we describe the critical amount of display --
In some undeep depth in Alaska sign methane in Alaska board.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to another team to another ondie.
Why! She's OK. The question is going to be able to be able to be able to be there.
A reason for that, this is that this huge macross is that this huge of warming warms.
This is a melectwo.
The water-volume is the cher than eat.
This is the Kanger-suain South west-Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea single agricultural because it is the place where it is the place where it comes in the sea of sea or approach.
These are taking stroming it fluence.
On the other side of the planet on the planet, on the South Pole, invents the largest ice mass of ice ice ice mass of ice ice ice mass of ice ice ice mass of the planet.
And the last months of reporting scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice ice ice bebehind a negative ice balance.
More specific is the ice of the South Pole is very quickly very quickly soon of the underwatering of the underwatering of the underwaters.
The whole continent to six meters for six meters like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the biggest ice mass and there are new now, which is another glaciers were still glaciers
40 percent of the world's population is the helps of his drink-water water of that melties.
In the Anths, this glestyle the source of drinkwater for this city.
There are more floor.
But when they disappearing the drink-water.
In California was a 40 percent in the snow of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the waterreservoires
And as you could read the predictions are going to be read to it.
This global dream to a read to a dramatical styer of footage of footage of footage of food.
And the number of nature, the number of nature, with an incredible and never seen any single speed and never seen seeing the whole world of fasts.
Four time in the last 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the past 75 years in the last 30 years in the last 30 years of the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the last last 30 years than in the last 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the past 30 years than in the p
This pattern is completely unkeep intending birth.
If you look at it from a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 across CO2 every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, look at the east of the United Stille and the United Stille Ocean, and on every single slide of Indian subcontinent, there's a behavian agent of oxygen in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big cause of the warming warming of the Earth, which is the deforestation, which is the fields of fossil fuels of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and and steenking, the coal is the most greatest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest exists together.
And there was a predict to build a lot more support carbon centrals.
But we see a couple of the summer.
These are the coton centrales where the bought was annuated in the last last years, and where green alternatives were proposed to be forgetting forged forged.
There's a political freedom, in our country.
The coal carbon -- and oil industry gave years to promove 250 million dollars to promote "shifting cool and promots, which is a opportunity
And that image to something like something like this.
And the guy was in Tennessee, at me in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons of cooler cooler and model.
You have seen it probably seen the news.
This is the one after one after one after the biggest waste in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising single shapes around the Kerst was the Kerst was the Kerst was the Kerster
Video: "Frosty the cotman is a continued to be a key bound;
He's frequent to America, and he reflect that our economy.
Frosty the cobbbbbber is screen.
He is paid and he was paid and employees their job."
Here is a big part of the support collapsing Virginia of days.
The biggest mine of the land is the big blaunches of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship -- "Let me be clear to be clear Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have talked about it."
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimating two campaigns on the too.
This is a little bit of a pint.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious threatening for our business.
That's why the reason is why the most important goal is to give us a giant engage to the light to the light and the rewards of the light and the rewards of the truth of value carb.
Fit is, coal is not smarking."
We find that it is shapes -- and it still read it still read it.
So, you don't make you feel not worries about climate change.
Let that only about us
Video: Acteur: Schone of carbon carbon and you heard a lot of about it.
So let's take a look at this hypermodern shoot carbon centrals.
Fantastic. The machines are going to make a little lawys.
But that's the sound of shapes technology.
Overy, the fact that the breaks of steenking of the most important causes of the most important warming warming the Earth, the remarkable shapes that you see all here.
Look ook a look well, this is the shoot carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational security.
Video: Stem: America in crisis, the economy, the national security, the national security, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red rate in all of these things, our dependent of fossil fuels, like vuilial collect and imported oil.
But now there's a patient new solution to get out of this.
Forth America 100 percent of a 100 percent of shapse ell electricity, within 10 years of years.
A plan to get America to get the work on the work on the work, a plan that makes us safer and the option of the Earth operating the Earth operating the Earth operating operating the Earth is a plan that safe us safer and the operating operate the safe opinions
Einally, a solution that resolution that enough is enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. On the tape of the way.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: It's about it to give America to the America to give America
One of the speed ways to make a end end of our dependent of old break shapes that our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
And they are 2: No we investments to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African old African old African old African old African's going to be able to be wrong.
If you want to go far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far.
We need to go far far, and faster
Thank you very much.
I gave an introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I reward to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am here is the ones that don't waren: The LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever scientific experiment ever scientific experiment has ever been able to get in the crazy.
It must be the circumstances that were less than a billions that were less than a billions of second after the universe of 600 million times a second after the universe of 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, dus!
This is the machine Genevation.
We took photos of that mini-Big Bangs in detectors in detectors that I'm working with the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in addition so that you can see the scale.
On 10 september last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a partment in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle-stral stral that all around the LHC, and with a set of the LHC, and with a piece of the LHC, which is working in the detector in the detector radied in the detector shaped the photograph of the LHC.
In other words, when we saw that picture on 10 September we'll see that the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this the biggest across or this this is the biggest of the Internet page and saw that the Internet page looked like this.
That means that we made a cultural as a scientific impact.
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to do with these golden behaviors.
These draws read 13 thousand of circle city working on enough the machine on enough power.
The engineers will say, "Not true you will say, "Not true.
They can do that because they can do that because they are superago.
So on min 271 grads, colder than the space between the stars, that can read the behaviors that are radiation.
In one of the connections between the nets of thousand magnets in the LHC, was a constructive old
And it was a wireless that was something and was introducing electrical weather that 13 thousand of amps.
This was the result.
This is still insult if you realize that that that magnets more than 20 tons and they were about 30 inches and they were about 30 inches in the world and they were going to put about 30 inches.
We had to do about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out out what we did it.
We all have been honored them.
Now they are back on weather.
Eind map the LHC will be tacks.
We will go back and we'll put it back and we expect to measure or right so that we can go out and go out and look what the building building the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe that we can be able to go and we'll be able to go and we'll be able to go out and we'll be able to go and go out and we'll be able to go and we'll be expect it to expect to expect it to be to expect and we can be able to expect and then in the expect to expect of the way to expect and we'juntions of expect and wear and wear and get to go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go on and get it and get
Now, of course, that have been able to reincidents the value of scientific research. It's easily to research. It's easy.
I think it's a hard thing that is so hard is, the fact that we go further than equal things like the LHC.
I let the last words on the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I think that we are not going to be able to do the values of the values of his learning to be the early of the values are saying "Nsomething so dangerous Faral is so dangerous for the human mind that our images of science of science that we have not to take a mysterions of science are not a new mysteries of science and that are not new world in the winner."
Thank you.
I would like to start with you to ask to ask you back to your children at your children at your children played with blocks
When you discover to how to go to it, they were going to take it and walk up and wood and walk up to the problems of the engineering and hands of space relations.
Rumtelevision is a point because of understanding the world to understand the world to us.
If an informed information by the physical interact by the name of physical interaction with objects -- together with my advise Pattion and my fish Jeed-At Jeed-ask Jee-An interacting -- what we would use a computer to ask a computer that moves on and wire that weeds on a way of digital vinger that weeks on a plate bigs that we can describe information with the information of information that we can degree information with with objects that we can conconfiess.
and can ordering as we want to do that?
These question that we decided that we decided to go to a answer to see the building of Sifttables.
Sifttable is a Sifttable computer in a cow-size computer size a cowky.
They can be move with the hand they can be able to feel each other, their movement and they free a shack and they fellow a sactt.
The nuclear understanding is the physical hands can be moved by blocks can they be moved by put it through to grab it.
And the top of the top of the same way of a new new ecosystem for the ways of a new ecosystem of digital information.
And that this aid resources have a more physical different, are consciously of their movement and even from each other, and even of the way we move and enjoy interactions of interactions.
I will start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video to tell a video to return by changing and others and others and others and others and others and others plays plays and others
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indians nasted each other, they will be going to interest in each other.
If they get surround, they can also this and make it and what nervous become some narrative.
And they feel movement and hell.
We realized that one of the interesting consequences of the interesting consequences of this interactive, the use of everyday is like it -- as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a fluid of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interactive,
In this example of three Sifttables of the example for and I can use them to go to a color in a low-to-become humans and get them to be ment.
If we have felt the way we go back and go back a little bit back.
There are some of the case possibilities for education of education, especially play with language, and logics that we want to give people the possibility to be able to see things quickly incencentive to see things quickly inside incencentive to see things quickly.
So here I show -- this is the development of a Fibonacci ran awful accy cross a simple account programmmate.
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single shake around the Sifttable, and give words every Sifttable, and sangle words in a dictionary.
And after about 30 seconds it is very recently recently a new series of meters with a new series of letters with behind possibilities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the excursion to the Media Lab, and I become a bunch them and I put them out and make a video of it.
They were really away from them.
And one of the most interesting things of these applications is that people needed neethelesis that people needed instructions of the most interesting thing that is that people needed instructions of these applications of account.
All you have to say is ""Pole, and they know exactly what they need to do.
Here are some other people at the testing of the other people at the time.
That's our youngest bulta tester, rightening, right?
And as it looks at the Sifttables living in the Siftttables
For him it was only blocks.
Here is a interactive painted paint.
We wanted to go to learn a platform for language.
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate demonstration.
He can bring new carracters in the scene, by just the Sifttable with that characters of the table.
Here he leave the sun open.
Video: The sun comes up up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good mind "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And by Sifttables and the nearly side, and the nearly places and the nearly respond to each other.
DM: and so his own storytells and so his own story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with a story with an open end.
and he decided how it goes to go on and he decided to get it.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example that I will show you to show Is a synthesizer and live music that we developed the recent of the lead, where every Sifttables and so forth.
Eender every different variations, where you can choose what you want to use which you can use what you want to use what you want to use
These sludes can be injected in the lege Sifttables so that you can see the pattern itself in the pattern itself in the pattern of the sounds of sounds in the pattern of Sifttables in the pattern Sifttables in the lege Sifttables in
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the lege Sifttable effects of a lege Sifttledly effects like reverb and filter.
They are going to be able to a sound and they get across by the side.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are applied to the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
And now I put the basline.
Video: DM: Now I add some slagwork on a little bat.
Video: And now I copy the filter of the filter of the filter of the making of the effect of the effect of the effect of the magine of the making of the making of the making of the making of the filter of the making of the filter of the filter of the major of the effect of the massive so that I
Video: DM: I can spend it to spend it by the office of the tempo blocks.
Video: DM: Now I copy the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reach the pattern as it plays.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise everything that I can improvise and shorter as I want to do it.
In the same thing that is the dimms of the dimms of the volume Sifttable to the left Sifttles.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion to make a passion from new people, and the passion of new people, which our brain in the way our brain and body works and work work and body working and body working and working body works.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design area in this design area with some possibility that we develop the developing that we develop in the lab.
The thought I want to bring about is that this is the only attention to a very new generation of aid aid resources for the interacting with digital media, which is the information of our world like we want.
I thank you to get out of heart.
I look at it to talk to you with you all the time.
I'm writing.
Buks writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My entire life long as I put a long time and I don't think that that will change that will change that will change that will change
And yet there is an amazing in my life and career and career and career and career with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote ungs that I wrote ungs -- "Ets, Bot, that that was very very in opposed to my first work and an international exist.
The sequence is that people now have to go to and always told me as if I do do do do it in the way that I do it.
Which does do do --
People come to me and ask me and ask to ask me that you can't get this success that you can never be able to equar?
You don't get your entire life will be writing your entire life but never a book that people will be able to be a book that people will walk?
Don't you get there?
Erg hunched and you know.
Of course, that would be very much. I remember that I remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, when I was a teenager.
People said, "Do you don't get that you never get success that you will never get succes?
Don't you get to be afraid to the way that you will go to to suggest by supply
You don't get your life to work on this work is going to be able to work without that something out of your work and that you will be able to be able to get your bitters on your bitteras of phal?"
Something in that stretation.
In the short is my answer to ask this questions on this novel.
Yeah, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough that are enough that are enough things that are enough that are enough that are enough to be a joy.
All of the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know where everything for all of things that makes everything.
For example, and other engine, and other engineering things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time that comes from, the last time that comes from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be jobs to be worth to their mention on Earth are se?
What is so particularly to creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the minesses of miness, something that doesn't happen to others don't happen to other.
Take my father. He was a short engineer, and I can't remember that there in the 40 years that he worked on him that he worked on him or he was not afraid or he was not afraid to him that was not afraid to him.
That's how to you say, "Yohn, how do it with your chemistry?"
No, no, so it was not talking about it.
To be fair to be fair engineers have been hind by the centuries of the centuries of the century reputation of manically, to be sent manically,
Scheat, who have these kind of reputation.
Not only writers they also have other creative people have been able to be able to be pretty instable.
Look at the grimming death the most magnifly the most magnife of the 20th century.
Many dies of choice by own own it.
And even those who don't have a suicide suicide suicide to be able to be concerned to be able to be concerned to be able to be suicide their gave to be suicide their gave suicians that doesn't seem to be suicidens.
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "With every one of my books is a little bit of myself is a little bit of myself."
That's pretty much to say about your lifeless work.
But of these kind of spoke we don't look at it.
We all have heard it before, and have it been accepted with all accepted and accepted it
The idea is that creativity is that creativity insull is that creativity is that a artisty and that a artisty will lead to the name of the entire thing to read to the same way to cellent.
So why I want to ask everyone here today you can life?
Do you do that OK?
Because I think I think about it, I think about it, I think I don't think it's not a little bit of the daught daught --
I think it's the weather swimming the weather.
And also even even more dangerous.
I don't like to see that this this century is so good.
We can creative minds a lot better spors to live a lot better to live a lot better than that.
I know that it for me, in my situation, in my situation, particularly dangerous in the dark of the dark contemporary connected.
In fact, the fashion which my career on the career now.
Go took at it, I still young amper vey at the time.
I can do maybe a decades to work on the decades of the four decades
And the Hoostiginion, all I will be still in the outside of the outside world as the work that following that extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can sell it is that highest probably my greatest success is my greatest success and behind me.
Yeah.
If you think of you think about it is your know's morning to be able to be neine in the morning to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be working with the work that I love the work that I love the work that I love
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long as long as I come to the conclusion that I only can just go through writing by writing a psychological protection in the process in the process in the process inside the process inbuilding.
I have to see it written a safe distance between mitself and my surprising between mics, and my surprising reactions.
I had been looking at the last year to ways to do that.
I'm in the history of the history and have me deeps in other civilizations to see or others to see or others have been able way to help people to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of the creative process.
My search of my square me in the old Greiess.
Let me go and it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greiess, and Roments and Romenas people don't have that creativity was from themselves from themselves
And they believe that creativity was a godddle-mind place, which is a departy, unknown place, to the human reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasonable reasons.
The Green calls called these these behind creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon that he had a demon that words influist.
The Roments had a kind of equivalent idea.
And if they were suddenly ago creative mind creative minds.
The funny is that the Romends with a genius not a genius to be an extincluding person to be a pient.
In their policy was a genius was a magic god-magical god-asseed in the walls of the poor.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house of the house of the house of the house.
If the artistic is working on the genius assistance.
And he gave he gave it works.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance that I had the first thing about the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that work in his work on the work
The artists was so in protection to mean to a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant working on the work of that are not all the eer.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genius to have helped by the invisible.
You know, you got worked on your work on you, that not only to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty undepended genion.
Lange time is that been considered how to the Wests was considered the West.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed everything.
There is a very new ideas that the individual human beings is the average of the universe is the middle of the universe and mysteries.
No space for mystical weathers from the goddline of the godddline world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely from the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history was going to be about artists that they were a genius and not that they had a genion.
I have to say that I have to say that a big follow.
And to make one person, one person, one individual individual that he or she or she whether it's the sourcell of the century mystery, of everything that godnment, creative and the known for a fragment, which is something that is too much to a fragic human psyche.
All you ask to swallows the sun swire to swire the sun
Egos are building up to gigantic proportions and there are incredible expectations to prestents to prestents of prestents and it
And I think this drug has made the last 500 years of artists of artists has made a lot of artists.
If that is, and I think is the question is, "What now?"
Can we do this different?
Can we go back to a old understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human beings and creative mysterious mysterious mysterio?
Maybe not.
We can do 500 years we can rational humanisn't until undone in a 18 minutes to do that in a 18 minutes and speech.
And probably the way in the audience people who are required scientific doubs are about the idea that elfoot that elfoot the idea that elfooder the work of artists to inspiring the work of artists to inspiring the inspiring of artists.
It doesn't seem to get me that I will get to get in that I will get to get in the time.
And yet I ask it out.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we do not possible?
It just like like that much as much as much as all the other explanations of the totally improved unct including unclide in the creative process.
Everybody who do something that has to do is to create -- so in fact, all the attention here -- you know, the creative process is not always rational process is not always rational process is not always rational age.
And that sometimes it feeling a paranormmy.
I have the great American closer American poems.
They are the poem of the nine-life's writing already writing them.
She told me about her youth on the platted, from Virginia.
Sometimes, if she was on the work was working on the work was a poem of the country.
It was so said she said, like a big golf air came out of the air came out of the air
And it was going to her close golf than the land to her apply
She felt that the ground of her feet began to shake her at that moment and then that moment but one thing to do to do -- and they were doing one thing to do --
She ran and they ran and they were going to see the poem and they had to see as quickly and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and paper and they see it as quickly as quickly by the paper and they had to see the paper and they had to see the paper and then they had to see the paper and then
When it came up by her hand her hand her hand her only chance her only chance to write it on the way to write it
Sometimes, she didn't get enough.
Then ring and ring side, but reaching it doesn't reach.
And at these moments the poets the poem of her him, and then sat the fields, looking for a lot of poetly.
And if I think that was even though I think this is the beautiful part of the story -- that they were almost most of the story -- that they were almost of the story --
And then she was looking for it and papier, and paapier, and paper, and the papiance of her him.
Just at that point she had a ptape of a ptledge of a ptape
And with her other hand, so told me them, she plucked the poem of the sky.
She paked it to his tail, and it back in her body, and it back in her body, while they wrote it in her body,
In that cases the poem which is the paper in the paper in paper and then in the paper and they were in the paper followed follow.
When I heard that -- what I thought -- what I think -- what I think is going to be able to do my creative process ey!
That's how my creative process no! I'm not a medium! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouse, I'm a mouse, which is a mouse of the same time stip and transforming and transforming and transforms and transforms.
But even in that daily swiming that I've had been such a experience.
You will also know it to know that if you can know that there creative ideas in your building, you can see that creative ideas possible.
What is that then to bron?
How can we use it without that we get it without word?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician's musicians.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine magazine --
We had this about this.
Tom is a big part of his life life was a big part of his life was the shown of the contemporary artists that from all power to get out of all power to get on the unconnected creative impulses in him.
And the years was Tom what the 190s.
And one day he reached in Los Angeles on the speed and change the process of the speed process of the radical process of the speed process of the speed process of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the spe
While he was so recently heard a fragmental of a melodie.
The decided to him, like inspiration that do is doing that inspiration that do is impacking.
It was a beautiful melodish and he wanted to fashion.
But it doesn't go to that.
He had no paper and he had no paper to a touch a tape of a paper at the time.
The well-known exciting back and the well-heat the head, "I got the melodies and then it stays and then it stays and then it remains of the century behind of the maintain the century beh
I'm not good enough, I can't be good enough."
He didn't get in panic, but he was not in panic, but he put that whole mental process and determined something news.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry hear, you cannot see that I sat the same same thing.
"Do you really think I can write a song of these?
If you really want to get that this song coming out later, you have to do later when I have time for you.
Don't not, anybody else else.
And then the neighborhener." And from that point that moment the time the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the neighborh."
The work is still the same thing with the most known dge of the dark of the dark support of to.
But the heavy exciting the creative process in him required to him that he distant the genion.
The genion was going to poem close and the livers and read only call.
Tom realized that there was no reason there was no reason to go to the engineer
It could be a wonder, bizarre society, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner aspect that not completely of Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of working changes.
I had been doing it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Bown.
And at a point of point I move in despers.
You know that what you don't know you want to work and you don't think it's a terrible ramp that it is a terrible ramp book book.
Not singer bad and bad it really bad bad bad and bad it.
I wanted to do all the project all of the project all of the project all of the project of the project of all of the project
And then I remember that are going to be taken to his genion, and I also decided to way.
I wish from my manuscrips and my manuscrips and foundation to a bounds.
And I said to say, "Lister dopinion, we know that if this is not just brilliant is not only to be brilliant because of me.
You can see that I have everything in what I have in what I have in me.
I can't give you a lot of them.
If you find that it better operating it better than you have to do your things.
Snap you do that, you know, you don't do that, you know, you can.
I just write because that's one of my work.
Oh, and in the notulen maybe be reseems to be a lot of the way to be able to be differently.
Tja--- Universation is the novels here
Eeuws ago, there in the North African desert people together to catch a sacle of mathlight to dance in the sacks.
Oren and hours and hours to the morning glors.
That was always great, because the dancers were completely professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes, it happened to be something extraordinary.
One of those dancers became transcendent.
You know, you know what I mean, you know, you have ever seen that you ever see somethough something at a performer.
It was like the time and the dance and the dance of a poor.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights nights and now everything else together.
And suddenly he not read a human beings just a human beings a human being.
In him, under him blow-blowed it blows.
A godnment him.
If something called it happened to be happened to people what it was Dan started to clap them and clap in the crops: "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
Because it was for them.
And the way, a fun historical party, the when the Moren South Spanin, they brought these living with them.
The extinction is the century of the century of "Allah." Allah." Allah." Allah."
That you hear to the day in the day's flaments and flaments and flaments and flaments
If an artists in Spanish something impossible or magical or magical or magical or magically, oil -- all of your own.
At understanding, a glip of God.
And the recipe we need to have what we need to have.
Lasty is the dance that the dance of the next morning to the next morning to expect on dinary ladness to 11 hours in the morning to be no goddal ladge of the morning laddless display is more disal ladyer is more hours
And at that moment he is a little parently more parently with debend and will never come to be able to get more to be able to get more to be supply more to be supplant to be more to be a little parenty.
Maybe there's never going to be somebody God never across a little bit of a while,
What does he have to do with the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to sell a creative minds for a creative mind.
But it doesn't have to be able to be not to be to.
Imagine that you don't go from extend that the most unlikely aspects of your person from your person from your person from yourself.
Imagine you believe that you believe them a while, and you know, a while,
When you get it on it, they are given to someone else.
And it is how to be able to be everything.
I have been doing the average of dareal thought that are thought of the thought of the day.
The last months I worked on a book that will be worked that will different. The book where a lot of too long to go out to a lot of removing to be challenges.
The opultions of illuster progress.
And if my mind with me to the hall, I keep the same for: Don't not afraid not afrag.
That, just you get your work.
And just you do these, which is what it is.
If you go to dance your job is going to dance you, thank you.
If the god-hearing genius is access decision to make a little moment in your work at a little moment of the wonderful sources of the wonderful sources and well, "Oly!"
And that doesn't go to the dance than thank you all agree.
And also then, "Oly!"
I believe that that I believe that that I believe it.
"Oly!"" because we have pure human love human love and property human love and propertilosity of human love and propertly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oly!
You know, I had it already it already about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and what that means of new sets of genome and discovers of genes.
We actually actually start to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digitizing digitizing of that digital code to a new fashion to a new fashion designs and synthetthesize the design and synthesesized.
So we always have tried to ask the big questions
"What is life?" is something that I think that have tried to understand how many biolos have tried to understand in different levels of biolos.
We tried to different approaches and it bringing to least a different approach.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize 20 years of the digitize 20 years
When we have the human genome genome of the human genome that was going to be sequence, to the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life regenerate life regenerats, or we can we live in this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genomes for a kind of genitself in a laboratory in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nice smaller genome genome and we can get a nice tiny.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or something,
But if we look at the metabolical map that relative simplicity is simply removed with the unso.
Gelood me, this is simply simply --
But when we look at all the genes that we can do it from all the genes that this is very unlikely that this would be a living cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell that would be a living cell cell cell cell that would be able to all the genes that would be a living cell cell cell
And so we decided that the only route of the only route to synthesize this chromosome of components so we could deal with the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we are we started asking questions like that, "Can we have a chromosome synthetis?
Sat the chemistry it to make these very big molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome of a chromosome of star?
A chromosome is just a soom of the marries of chemically, to be a chemically,
So, our tempo of the digitize of life is access to life is access on exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code the genetic slose slowly slowly slow-slow-slow-slow-slowing the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code the genetic code the genetic code the geneti
And our last point of the last point on this moment in a exponential curve.
We're taken over 15 years ago.
There were some stage for a bunch of stage for a bio-ethical access to the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult that is very difficult that the synthesis of DNA is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that small pieces of DNA, 30 to 50 to 50 letters in lengths, so how longer you make it a degenerative process, so how much more fales.
So we had to make a new method for the new method of these little pieces and the correct of all the folts.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria death that bacteria --
We designed the pieces of the pieces of fallowing the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part when we put a little bit of chemical stant chemical stant chemical stant straints and the bacteria and the bacteria and viral particles, and virtually make viral particles.
The viral particles, when they were going to reach the cells, they came back and they came back and deaths the E.
I was unlet to be speak with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model but I said that model to get to well.
They laugh more than you laught it.
So we think this is a situation where the software are building hardware are building in a biological system.
But we wanted to be a lot bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome of chromosome of the entire bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
And so we decided to build them in cassetttes, so we could be able to build the cassettes that we could varial the cassettes
to understand what the way the detakes are working components of a living cell cell.
The design is critical and if you start with digital information in the computer than that need to be very accurable information in the computer than that digital information.
When we first first this is this genome in 1995 was the standard-the standard precision one wrong is one wrong a 10,000 basepares.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 fales. If we were the original sequences than it was not in the way to start to get to start.
And part of the design of the design of pieces that are 50 letters that are 50 letters that are 50 letters to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that we have to build so that we have to design so that they can go together.
We design in this room in this room.
Maybe you have some of the amazing that we put watermarks.
Bet, we have a four-lettery genetic code: A, C, G.
Trios of those letters cos for 20 aminozurs -- that there's a little attack-inoxygen is to each aminoxys.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, send in the genetic code of mind.
And in and, we just get to me.
Some of them were telegled that there were no poems.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzyms that they repairs and together.
And we started to make pieces of these pieces of pieces that five to 7,000 letters were to 7,000 letters were to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letters than sets of 24,000 letters than sets of 72,000.
In every stage we move a floor, we could see a float, so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that will be very robust -- that you can see the straft -- that you will see the strays.
We try to reach the point of automatiseration.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as we get to the really big pieces -- over 100,000 basepares -- then they don't grow so easily more in E.
That is the most of all modern modern tools of the modern biology.
And so we went to other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that that homoloil recombination and repairs that is used by biology to repairs and repairs together.
Here is an example of it.
There's an organized Deinoccus radiodurans that three million radio durans that three million radiation to can.
That you see in the top paneel, smy chromosome of chromosome of the sopm is just from each other.
12 ots 24 hours later, he put it back in each other, exactly like the first thing was first of the first time.
There are thousands of organs that arounds these arounds of organizes that are thousands of organs that are.
These organisms can be drood.
They can live in a vacuum.
I know absolutely that there life in space, that can be able to move in space, that can produce a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been smarried that there is a lot of it,
Here is a detage microph of the molecule that we've made with these processes -- in fact, in fact, but yesterstern mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we did in the right thing that we did them.
And it is that they add automatically add automatically.
This is not an electron-microscope microscope photograph.
It's a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes are photos, gentles.
This is the audience we put unlients out of unlients.
This is more than 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever made by people, with a diverse structure.
The molecule weight is more than 300 million.
If we would go to a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages and then 142 pages to present the genetic code of genetic code
Well, how do we started to do a chromosquito we get a chromos?
And with a virus is the clear easy pretty easy.
And by a bacteria is a lot of complicated.
It's also simpler if you give you eukaryots, like wis: you knew and just do the cell cells and do another in, and that's what you know as it closes.
In the bacterified is the chromosome of the chromosome of cell, but we have unlients that we see a complete transplant to see that we can integrated transplant to a chromosome of a cell transplant to another one.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbs.
These are about that far away from each other.
We added some extra genes so we could take this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of these chromosquit.
We have it to make it with enzymes to make all the protein the glows.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be the very avanced graphic images here -- the new chromosome of chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to soon, but we tried to go to set it process what we thought to do it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discoveries all kinds of species that have a second chromosome of chromosome or a third chromosome of property or a thousands of properties in one time of the species.
People that evolution are evolving to be a lot of biology doesn't have a lot of biology not have a lot of biology
There are enzyms that restricti-enzyms that are enought DNA.
The chromosome that was not going to have not equivalent to it.
The cell -- the chromosome that we put in it in it -- well,
It was express, and the recognized the other chromosome as strange of material, and so we had the entire we had only the cell with the new chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosome of chromosh and it was going to recognize the cell of the chromosophisticated as a strange as a strange of chromosome of the other chromosome of the other chromosophibitttties
He was blue of the genes that we put the genes that we had straight in it.
And in very short time all the characteristics of the one species of the entry and change he changed in the new software that we put in the new software that we in the cell we put in the cell cell in the cell of the cell of the cell of the new software that we put in the new software that we in the new software that we in the new software that requird of time and
All the proteins changes, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code -- it was changed.
This is a main as genomics like genomics but we are in the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Good, I pay before, which is not a creation that this is not a creation -- this is prevent in 3.5 billion years of evolution, and I paid that we may be almost a new version of the Cambrary explosion of the Cambrick explosion of new species of scale new species of scale new species of form.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear if you look at what it needs is.
We're going to be in ses-a-a-half to nine billion people, during the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context in my context in 1946.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us that lived in 1946; within 1946, that there are four four in 1946.
We have hard with food with the concerned water medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That's what is going to do that for neine to do that for news.
We use five billion tons collapse of 30 billion volts of volates.
That's 100 miloons of ves;
When we take biological processes in ogency or what process than also to replace; then that is going to be a huge challenge challenge challenge of day.
Then there is a natural all of the carbon dioxide of the stant atmosphere.
And by all of our global discoveries we have a database we now have a databas, and that I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronics had but a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that comes out of the diversity that is coming out of that is coming out of that is coming out of that is coming out of that is coming out of a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of a dozen components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is coming out of a dozen different components, and look at the diversity that is
We are predicted by a biological reality and our exists and our imagination.
We have techniques of it very quickly synthesesemethods to do so called combination genomics to do so called combination genomics.
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the company of 20 million different genes, or tries to optimalizing processes to make octaneously octask or medicines or medicining with a small team of team team -- we can change with a small team of the science.
And it's only a lot of selection.
We can select for life-fatbarity, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design image of what real design software where we working on the gang and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design.
We don't know how it will look like.
We know exactly how their genetic code of their genetic code
We focus on fourth generation of fuels.
Our nargs have seen to ethanol of the bad experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come in and third that will come out of sugar, to more high diggers like sugars like octan ack-like approo.
But the only way we think we think that biology can have big influence that biology big infood and the available and the available to read as we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we are food cells that we do do it in that way to design that way we do the first thing that we do to do that we do the first generation of the first way to have the first of 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries discoveries that we have all kinds of other method.
This is an organize that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles of miles deep, in cood-too.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular hydrogen like energy sources as energy sources as energy sources.
We are looking at the way we can take CO2 and we can take a pipipet through pipes and that can be able to frace, where that CO2 to burn to fuel to burn this process to burn this process to hour.
So in a short of time we think we are able to think we are able to break that we are able to break the basic question: "What is life?"
We have working, you know, the protected of the ptrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED where they do do it?
A important energy source of energy source of the major source.
But we also work on the way to use these tools to be able to think about fastful servaccines.
This year was the flu, we always walked like the floats like the facts of the flowing vaccine.
I think that can change that change by texties of the textiny vaccines that can make it by the time.
Here you see how the future can see how the future, the evolution tree, the evolution tree, the accelerating bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still far away from the improve people.
Our goal is sure that we make a chance that we make a chance to survive to do that which is going to do that which is going to be able to do that which is what to do. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you as a little bit like to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft to Microsoft -- this is Seehavior.
And it's a environment where you can go out and go out and remotions of the conclump of the data can work in the way that you can work
We look at the way, here many gigabies to digital images and can be able to keep in the way to in-- and inside and the sorters, and the sorters to our lives.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information or images or images are these collections or images or images are of these collections or images or images or images or images or images or images we look at how much information.
Most of this is normal digital camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel of the Librane.
It all doesn't matter because it would be able to influence the prestations would be able to influence on a third system, the amount of pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, an example of non-image of the same thing.
This is the graug house by Dickens. Elach cold collade is a headdge.
And to prove that it is really text, and not do no imagination, and not do something that we can do something that this is really texty, and this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little strange of strange way to read a hind book a book of a book of strange book of a book of strange book at a time.
I wouldn't be able to be follow.
This is a realistic, example. This is an example.
Every big image is the beginning of a substance of a submercial.
This is really a fun, and the experience of a real paper paper of a real paper or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium is.
We also have something done something with the corner of the Guardian.
We made a nep advertention of higher resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertising -- and we have information.
If you see the possibilities of this car, you see it looks like this.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limits of acting acts through the screen.
We hope that this is not going to be pop-ups and other third flaul -- not need to be more than not need to be more than not need to be more than that.
Of course are amaps a single of the hand the engage of a technology like this, I will not spend here to spend a time to spend a lot of the such that we can also be able to this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top on top of a NASA
Let's look at something else else.
This is now the way to the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, which two techniques two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and it's a very beautiful piece of computer-vision research research to the University of Washington, by Steve Seitz at University at U.Washington,
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is live on the Web. It's meant making by Seadragon.
When we do this, we see that we do this, that we can see the images and the multi-resolution resolution resolution.
The room of the images has meaning of the images is meaning here is meaning.
The computer-vision algorithms have these images are removing together, so that they are reflect the real space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadese Rockies -- where they are the genomes -- where they are elected diashowledge of these things are space.
I don't know if there's time time to show you another environments.
There are a lot of space television.
I want to like to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of a early prototype of Photosynthesis that we worked on our websitting -- to the the communicate what I have in my head is the worth of this techniques that we look at our website at our website.
We had to keep account with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with images from Flickr. You just look at Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get out of the Notre Dame in Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs a picture of image that model of this model that turns out to be part of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model that model of this model of this model of this model of this orange of this orange of this orange of this orange of this orange of these orange of orange orange --
And so these are all Flickr images that are in this way space that are copied in this way.
And we can do at simple evidence.
You know, I never thought that I would never work to work at Microsoft would work at Microsoft
It's overwhelming here is so under to be able to be able to be able to be so under this.
I believe that you can see that this many types of these types of gsm to mirrors to mirrors a lot of them together.
I'll try to find some strange some strange images
There are so many works and so much worth and so much by the view of faces and so much of it.
Exwhere between this is even a series of photos -- here are them.
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that also is cheap, by the program.
If we have four through the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can do do things with the social environment. This is using the data -- from the whole collective memory of the entire collective memory -- and the Earth looks like each other.
All these photos are connected, and shapes a little bigger than the som of the parts of the parts.
You know, you have a model that from the entire Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
As a way of sequence at Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Aarth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use it as they use it as they use the predicts of the people who use it.
Their own photos are predicting metap-data that somebody else inved.
If someone would want to get these heigs and their names and their names and their names is going to be able to do with all of the Notre Dame read with all of the same same thing that that is, and I use as an access to that space, which metape versus to this space versus and creating a kind of cross and created social experience.
And of course, it's the bat, the batch product a immense rich virtual model of every interesting place, which not only not only from from the air photos, satellite images and other applies and other applies is to be enought from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Heb I understood that what you do software possible, in the next years, in the next years, all of the images that are dealed by everyone in the world can copy together?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovering is discovering.
It creates, to your wish wisdoms, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that basis of the data in the images.
And that is going to be recent when you think about the richchess of semantic information that many of these images are available information which many of these images are available to be awful that many of these images are available to be available to the rich,
When you look at the web and you go to imagine a search and the text and the text on the webpage of information on the webbpage of information about what the image we have been talking about what the image we have a lot of information about what the image of the image of the image of the image of the web.
What if you have this image is to all your image is to all your images?
Then are the number of underling's connections and the amount of wealth that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of the immediately comes out of the networking.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicitation.
One of the intense pleasant and enographics and enographics is the possibility to live in the way between those who are not forget their paths to be remembers in the wind, the engaged in the rapiding bits, the profittles.
The science that Jaaaxy still the Malky equal traveling the Mililky of Inchestry-olds of Instincluding meaning in the Himalay wful book at the break of Dhar, remember of Dhar, you remember the anthropology is not in a solution of the anthropology, but the world in a solution of the anthropology is not one shapology is still not a shapology
the consequence of a application set application that our ancestors that our ancestors made our ancestors.
Of course, we all share the same adapted requires of the same ors. Breng children in the world.
We are all insluding things that we are going to make all intense.
Omust go with the inverbal dishapes by the death.
So it can be surprise that we all sings, dancing and art
But interesting is the unique of the song of the song and the ritm of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is to the Penan in the wolden in Borneo, or the Voodood acolds in Haiti, or the freeders in the Kaisuttil-Kaisutteria, the Curther in the Andesss-based or the Caravanai in the hart of Sahart of the Sahara -- this is the desert of the desert of the desert of the desert of the desert of holds of holds of the device of the device of the devices of high of Q.

They all teach us that we can be able to be thinking different, us in the earth of oriently.
If you think about it, this idea you can only give you a lot of them just hope.
Samen shapes the intelligengency of spiritual and cultural and cultural and cultural life that the planet and as important as important as it is as important as the biological life web: the biospiritual lives,
This cultural life web you can imagine as a enos;

No biolog would be working that least the lessure of all kinds of all kinds of the species of the species of state, because that's not where simply is not where it is.
And the most optimistic scenario scenario scenario scenario of the most optimistic scenario of cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is the loss of the paths.
And when everyone here was born born there, there were sixes to be sixes on Earth.
A language is more than her word-shat or her grammatical rules of her grammatical rules --
A language is a tape of the human vision.
It's the birth of every unique culture the soul of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is a century cold, a century mind, a dishapse of a mind thought, a ecosystem to spiritual potential possibilities.
And from that six-thousand is is the day the day the day is the day the day of not more fluistered in children

They were going to get the photos and tried to find the shape the shape the face face.
When they didn't have anything to found, they concludes them that ries-pivel that they were going to be spent with springs to speak with spirit was going to be through spring.

And Voodoo is simply the depth of this depth religious ideas of this depths in the tragic diaspora while, the slaverny diaspora while resed.

That's why why foodom. And so you go to the church and talk about God.

And somewhere they are the younger brothers, which are responsible for the destruction of the world.
And on this point is the intuitive device.
If we think of inheems and landscape, and we often Rously Ruming and the old fabelt of the edel, a idea that racistic is in simple that racistic is in simple that racistic is simply in his simply --
Or we put Thoreage and say that these people, and say that these people.
Inheems are nor sentimenteel, nor is expected by nostalgy.
For both is little space in the malaria moer asses of the Asmat or the push of the Asmat the ice winds of Tibet. Desalnitmin the awards of the Earth, and the ritual mystic of the Earth, which is based in the idea of the Earth, but on a much subtiles of the Earth, but on a much subteacher intuitions are only on a lot of the Earth, because of the human livourage of the lives.

Or it the likely of a mind or a lot of it, is irrelevant.
Interestingly, the metaphor that define the contents between the individual and the natural world.
I'm growing up in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were going to be crasses there were craising to be crazy.
And that made me another ment, I think a different different from the Kwagiulth, who believe that that those who believe that that those who are the living the lives of Kuxwhukw Snavel Snavel of the Hemel and the cannibal mine in the north of the orth of the world around the ords of the world around the world round of the world and the Kuxwhiere.
These minds are important time their Hamatsa-inducation.
If you start to the idea that these cultures can be able to do different realities of these cultures to get some of their extraordinary discoveries explore and do these plant.
It's a picture that I have a photograph that I have a photograph nam.

That poodle your blazs, as a poem of a poems, and profess, and profest of the baroks, to countries on a sea of electricity. This is not a dishapment of reality, it doesn't have a dishapse of reality.
I tried to convince my professor, Richard Evan Shultman, which was a man who did the psychedian asted including pads in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryptamines were not to identify as hallucinating as hallucinating because when the effect intricity to experience the home. Tryptamines are not to take the hallucination because they are not oral to be involved in the human arming, because they are not going to have to be an enzyme in the human arming, because they are not going to be halluxidase.
They can only be oral enoman enoms of something that the monoamine of sun.

Now, the problem is that even the those of us who are under us that sympathics are insacross insacle and color and color and color and color or initial inside the history as the real world, means as the real world, meaning our world, meaning our world, means our world,
The truth is that the 20th century of 300 years not remember of 300 years to be war, or technological innovations, but more technological innovations, but more active to the amazing of the mass of the mass of the mass of biological and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural diversity and cultural diversity to the planet not change change in the planet.
All cultures always have a dance of new life to a dance new life possibilities.
Technology is also the problem is not the problem.
The Siou-indians don't stop Sioux indians are not Sioux and book as they were to be as winning their pile, when they put their piles and they were to be in the purple and way.
It's not change or technology that the integrity of the eator threat. It's power. It's power.

Where you see in the world, you think it's not the lot of these cultures to get the way of these cultures to disappepear.
These are dynamic lives, whose existence is being told by identify forces that are profession possibilities that are remove to their applications of advantage of the entirely follows.
Or this is to be the huge of deforestation in the home land of the Penan, a nomadical Asian nomadicically ended up and with the forth generation in the forest, and now reduced the forest, and now reduced to the river distributed to the river itself is to the river that the rivers, where the rivers are looking for the rivers of Borno Chinese and Chinese Sout, which seems to the sung Chinuth Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese
to filling their skeping with trees from the bottom stems of the forest.
In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that are involved as a result of the discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibetan mountains where I do a lot of research of political government.
Genocide, the physical extension of a completely universal display of a completely of life evil, the destruction of a people, not only is not only not only in many areas as as part of a developing of a developing strategy.
The pine of Tibet is not to contain the basic levels on the basic level.
I have a young colleague of the land of Chength of Chength in West-China to Lhasa.
And as when I came to come in Lhasa was going to be able to be the statistics that you heard.
6,000 Heily monuments destructive 1.2 million people during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of my colleague was acted to the Panchen Lama.
And he was done of the Chinese invasion when the Chinese invasion.
His uncle flight with the Dalai Lama in the diaspora, which brought the people in Nepal brought to be able to be in Nepal --
His mother was taken because she was set because she was rich was rich
He was the prisoner to the prisoned when he was two -- he was hidden her rock, because they don't not without hidden without hearing him on it.
The sister that heldhaftig smokes in a food smokes in a food skin in a opinion.
On a day they get a poor, they had a poorer of Mao. For this over, they were seven years of a dage they were shapes in a year.
The pine of Tibet can be unwirels, but the contains of the population of the population of the population.
And finally, it comes up on a choice.
Will we live in a gray world of simply or we want to live a color we want to reversity or or we want to go to a color or or we want to be able to go in a grab world of diversity or we want to live in a grab.
The big anthropologists Margaret Mead said to her dead that we can get a tracking, that we can produce a global image image image that we can move the amount of the same anthropology said.
We don't only think we would see the human imagination are limited to a mely, but also we would even have been able to see and we forget that there are other options are other options are other options of exist.
We can feel us at the idea that our kind of pas about 150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitical Revolution, which we gave our agriculture that we had to give us the cult of the shaman was replaced by the shaman was replaced by the proza specialization of the priest of the priety, and we got a specialization by specialization of years ago.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This surface history that we have not gives me the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that the next millennia on our path.
If the intelligent cultures of the world to people are asked the meaning of people, they answers are asked with 10,000 different voes.
And it's in that song that we will discover the possibility to be discover to what we are in the work that is a population species that that asks all the population and all the tuins. There are great. There are great. There are great. There are great.
This picture I have this now, I have the northern point of Baffin Island taken with Inexcise at the narwal
This man, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always friendly for the Inextinction. In the 1950s, to focus on the 1950s, to focus in taken tools.
The opa of Olayuk weather.
The family peaceing for his life and met him already him already are tool.
Now you have to understand that the Intermined for the colle; they make use it using it.
The birth of their bad-wards of their bads, in fish in the caribs.
Olayuks up to the poolnaked for the pools or the storm that was going to be able to the pool.
He went out to outside his boundary, and he was bounded skins and poep, and poep in his hand. When the poep began to be woman, he shaped it as a lemit as a limet.
He brought a low-taken on the sides of the sith,
When it was solid, he was a dog of them.
He met the dog and improvised a harn.
From the ribban he made a bad of the rib.
He was looking at a hood in the neighborhood, and disappearing the ice flake, including poeps.
And it far with nothing to go around with nothing in many ways, in many ways, symbol for the weather the Intermines and all the inside of the Intermination of the world.
In april 1999 Canadian government the Intermination of the Intermination of a piece of land than California and Texas sells and Texas sells us new home. It's called our new home.
It's independent region. They remember all the ground.
It's a bluffing example of how a natic enough enough enough to her people can bitat her people can bitat her people.
And finally, I think it's clear to the mind of the world to this high to these high world is removed to these high world is not far away.
They're somebody else home country.
They are going to be able to 20, the human imagination, which are going to go back to the begin to the beginning of the time. And for us all the dreams of these kids are going to be the unlimited by the unadult of hope.
What we do at at National Geographic, is extended to be reaching the idea that politicians never reaching something that politicians never reach.
We think that polemics -- we think that a polemics not convincing that stories can change the world, which we probably the best we probably the best we probably the best we are the best tellers in the world is 35 million times a month, we are in 156 countries on the table of display shines a milliensing of audiences a million.
We make a folding to travel to the enos; we can go to the equivalent cultural places that the tape cultural places that the task of what it looks like to see what he seeing is that that it will be a way to live in the anthropology will go to to be able to live in a variety of lift that we can find a way to live in a multiultiultic world and pluralistic world and pluralistic world
where all the wisdom of all the population can be several to us what we have sadone and what are seems to be seems.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about you with you some question of what I want to talk about a book that I have evidence.
Maybe you see paralls with information of other sources from other sources.
I also try to explain some bands that you can get some light that you can get a little bit.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the westery, industrialized society.
And that official dogma lubs like follow-support of our citizens on the highest level, we need to get them as much as possible individual freedom of them as possible freedom.
Freedom is a big good good good good at the same time.
And the top of the top of us to do to accurate us to do to be able to acting a higher which is a higher which is to reach a higher and inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices like people have more free people are free free
And more freedom means automatically more well.
This is so deep become in our society that nobody would be able to do that nobody would be done to do that nobody would be in our society.
And in our life is this dogma step of spending to be able to be disilent
I'll give you some examples of our modern choices of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A high. A high.
Even about dressings.
Nart that 175 changes are sings in my supermarket tens are different in my supermarkes are different extra-virtual tra-virtual b.
And that you can make your task of your tasy own threats for the case between 175 species for you.
So that's the purpose of my supermarket.
Look at electronics stores. You can see itself your stareoset of your stareoset of city speakers, cassettespeler, radio, resturing tespaland.
And that one electronics that you can see the enduring of this number of the number.
You can be six-half million different systems with parts of parts of these stores.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
At another example -- communication.
When I was young long ago, you could all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You have the conclude it. You bought it.
And that had the way the advantage that it never go.
The time is for.
Tegen's a lot of different applications are a lot of different applications of different applications are a lot of different applications are a lot of different applicates.
And in mobile of cell phones is the diversity immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- that the middle -- that the m3-making major and crishing break break break break and crishing it and bridge break and cracks.
And you don't have this model you don't see this model in the winks, but you can sure that that that happens in the winks.
The sequenc: people come to the winkle and assuming these question.
And you know how the answer to that question.
No,
It's not possible to buy a mobile that doesn't do much too much to do it.
And in aspects of life that life that are much more importantly, than the attention of stuff, this explosive is a part.
Gealth care, it's in the United States inmiddle inavers not that that you go to the doctors that you have to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A, or we can do A, or we can do BB.
A has this forward and name it and nadone this is going to be able to do this.
BBe has this front and nadone this is going to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, what is finds you find out of the mind?
And the doctor says, "A has this predicts and and and narrative this forward and nature this -- and nature this -- and narrative and name this forward.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was doing?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you go."
And we call that "own intain the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision that the shaping of things -- the doctors of things -- the doctors -- the doctors -- the doctor, somebody who are seeing the best condition to take decision to take decision to take decision to take a lot of advantage of advantage gets much more advantage of advantage of decisions that is made much more advantains.
Good considered that somewhere in it, because the purch, you know, and I can't buy them.
Why do do do if we can't buy them?
Because they think that we think we think we go the next morning our doctors to ask that other mains.
Our identity -- you know, a ingresponsible aspect of us are now overfellow on choices like you can see on these dia.
Our identity is able to be located from our background.
We find ourselves from -- so often we want to do it -- so often we want to do it.
Everybody morning to be able to think what person you want to be able to think what person you want to be able to be able to be think.
Let's talk about the shaping shape.
There is a time that free everybody else there are automatically from that you could be able to soon as quickly as possible to kids so quickly as possible to kids so quickly as possible.
The only realm was while, not when and why, not when and what you do do it in the next thing you know.
Now free everything for the operate for the operate
I lead lets at the particulars that I took at least students, which I was event less househomework and they were going to be saying.
They are not dommer or or agree or agree than in the earlier.
No, they have it to make choices.
"You know, already whether I married not?
Or I will I wait? Do I first children or a career or a career or a career or a career or a care?"
These are all single questions.
They go through to them to a answer to them as it means that they don't get their homework and that doesn't get their homework and that doesn't get good circle cle.
And they have right. They're important lifeless.
And then we come to work with work. Carl just already us that technology us to work every minute every minute of every day day -- except in the Rolph Hotel.
There's one place, which I keep secret that I love measure.
I don't think I think because I want to keep the place that place.
But good, which is a huge choices of work in that we are going to be ask us that we go on and ask on and we'll work on and whether we're going to work or not.
We can look at a footbalth of our son, with our son, with us and our Blackberry on the one side, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and our laptop on the other hand.
And even if they all get out of the weather, we are all the time of that wedth of all sorts of questions, "Am I responsingle answer?
Am I response to this email? Am I write these letter?
And even if the answer is, we experienced the footbalth of our son in a very different way.
Where we also look at the big, the small, materialistic saving, life is a choose of choos; it's a kissues.
That's how the world used to be saw it looked like.
There were some choices but not everything was a kissues.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now, Is this good or bad?
The answer is: "Yes."
We all know what is good about what is good about it, so I'm going to talk about what is bad to it.
That huge choices has two effects of two effects on the human beings on the human beings.
A very opposite effect is the earlier that the earlier than free that the free.
And with so many choices people find the hard to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically, a very dramatically, of a research to invest in volunte-planns.
A colleague of mind to investment data from Vanguard, a big polard, a big policy, a big policy societies with about 2,000 founds.
They discovered that for every tes of every tearing foundations that the working on the working on the working, the particularly two percent of the tunately.
And in five-founds. Whyet did 10 percent less employees than five than five and five founds. Why?
Because it at five-ftimate is so hard to choose that people are just going to be able to choice the next day, and that are going to go out and that it up, and so on.
And of the extiny comes from the point is coming out.
That doesn't mean that people after their pensionate after their pensionate not only bread because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have seen that the choice known that the choice was so hard to have it works.
they were going to go to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose.
The worked very much to double their own behavioral to doubles.
So many of choices can be lose to work on a lower works.
And I think the world is that the world looks like this.
If it goes to the century the century of you want to go to the right choice making the right choice of the choice choices -- right?
You don't want to be refound, or even the wrong found, or even the wrong threat.
That's the first effect. The second effect. The second thing that we had the lost of our disnows, and eventually education and chood, ultimately less to the result than it would be as we had had been as we had had been had.
There are meant reasons for them.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, in the tasy of tallowed that the choice doesn't look perfect.
You ask you in this case, that a different choice would be better better ke.
This dry alternative alternative that you get your choice.
And then does sat the break of the choice of the choice that you have made you made that you have made a good choice choice choice as a good choice.
The more options are going to be able to be able to get spike of unaway from unaway of unaway of the gets of the gets of the gets of the gets of the gets of the engineering option.
A second reason has to do with substitutic substitutions.
Dan Gilbert gave morning to how often we depend the value of things we put them on the value of things we are similar with them.
If you can indent, if you can indent, you can see many alternatives you already the attract of all alternatives that you determine the enternatives you determination that you were determination that you can see the attractivity that you can see many alternatives you alternatives you alternatives you alternatives you in many alter
That makes that you fewer with the alternative that you have bought the alternative that you have bought it.
A example. For example. For the non: My excuses.
This is a little bit the stretch of this example.
This is on vachance in the Hamptons.
They have a third woundation.
They are on a beautiful strand. Straling weather. No human in vision.
Don't be right? "Don't be able to do it," thinks that man, "It's augom.
Everybody in my neighborhood is the city of the city.
I could be able to the car for the door to the door parkers."
And he is two weeks to do the idea that he was a great parking of the idea that he saw every day a great parking place.
The substitution cost of the entire we have to have our choice as we have, even if we make a great choice choice.
The more possibilities are going to be able to be more attracks are going to be there.
And those presenting us as substitutions as substitutions
Another example.
This image store to some points of points.
Like in the way, and now for example, and that you have to go out and now
Another is that you get with every choice other choice other choice other choice other choice.
And all of that other has so attract as it is that the care the cooks are reminder the cooks of the getable to be return.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this in the time my square to a new bomb.
I always turn out to be able to get rid of it.
Ber was only one kind of stuff, and one kind of stuff, and that cost totally it doesn't make it incredibly unch a fastly uncomfortable enough and felt enough enough and often enough enough and often enough enough it wrong enough, and felt enough it was until the bought to be a kind of boundly enough, and it was not a little bit of
And I went to the winket for a news.
I said, "Day, I want to be a speech, this is my me."
And the winker said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit or relaxed or relaxed fity?
Do you or a rhyth? Wilt you were stone-ad-wash or acid-ad-ward?
Do you have a boundary effect?
You know, you know something like something like pipes, or fless." And so he went on on and so he went through and so he went through
I was talked about it, I was a while, I said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only bound."
He had no idea which bounded that was and so I have a hour for a long hours all the possible bbles of the bounds.
And I think of it is first of all, I remember the winkle with a challenge of a bomb.
I had done better better than anyway, I could do it better do it better do it better do it better do it better does.
But I don't feel better not better better me.
Why? Or do this on mitself out of myself, I wrote a book in a book of themselves.
The reason I don't feel better with all of the choice, that I started to expect to expect to expect of a good speeching bribs.
I started without any expectation, because I just started to be a kind of spirit -- but one kind of speaking.
When it turned out there are different wars, and one of the perfect.
What I bought was good to be good at the time.
And so I read my bouncements, and that asked me with my boundations and that asked me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to expect more expectations they have cowed about the purpose of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less to be less with results, even if the good results are the good results are.
Marketings don't know this.
Because in that case, you don't know where I'm talking about what I have now.
In the real thing it is about this.
Everything was worse when everything was worse
Because when everything was worse to be worse to be surprising experiences.
In our modern society as well as well as well as a perfectly perfection, but the best thing we can ever reach that something that we could ever be able to expect as we had been expected.
Nonce we have surprisingly, because our expectations, my expectations, are high and be high high and
The secret of happiness -- this is to be all of this -- the secret of happiness is not too much much expect to be too much expect to be too much expect to be a lot of happiness -- the secret is not too much of happiness is not too much of happ
I want to do do -- a car biographically elementally ely, which is a woman who are really fantastic element.
I haven't asked her to her less tester with less testing.
But with less enough needs are good changes are good changes to be good changes.
And finally, when you get a bad bad as a bad bad as a bad like one kind of predict is one kind of predicted to ask why you can inted.
The answer is simple.
The world is responsible. Because you haven't you had no choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds are available to be able to fall, which is what it turns out to fall, who's responsible?
The answer is just so simple. That's the you.
You had a better choice better choice.
With hundreds of different bounds of balance.
So if people decided to take the results of those decision are good to decide and are they are telegood.
And that take themselves.
In the western society is clinical depression under the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger gener
A factor -- not the enige, but it's a significant factor in this explosive too single of depression and self-suicident experiences are about their high-expected.
And if they try to explain themselves, they give themselves to explain themselves the decade.
So the nettore-taking objective that we put objective to go on on advantage of it, but our bad in the enters.
As a little bit another together.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be able to where everybody is going to be able to get on where everybody is going to be able to where everyone is going to be awful for where everyone is going to be awful for where everyone is going to be awful for where everyone is is the official dogma,
But that's not not the way it is.
It doesn't required that can choose better than not can choose better than not choose to be able to choice that more choice is better more choice better is better choice better is better better than not care.
There's a magic floors on choices. Who, I don't know.
But I know that we have been able to the point that are equal for us that are several our well.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep the best thing that we can keep the best thing to keep us the best to keep us the best to do it.
The choices in industrialized countries is coming out of material overfluence from material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we already heard about where the problem isn't so much choice is that there is too much choice that is too much choice that is a lot of choice that is not so much more choice.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that I speak for moderne, which West.
That's frustrers, and this is this -- Steve Levitt Levitt you yesterday that expensive and installs are not helping kids don't help help from your money.
I say the same thing about this dure, incused choices -- they don't help not, they don't help shaped to go out to focus to shade the shape.
They make us livil.
If a part of what people in our society in our society to make all of these choices to be concludes to shake up to little options have to go on and live in it.
And if us live in the way to go on on it.
That's what economists a Pareto-a-improve better than
Everybody is better by reversion of what skull -- not only poor people -- not only poor people -- and that comes through the last of choices that we are with our behaviors.
And finally, if you read this image story -- you read like to say human as a developed human as developed to say "Ach, what fish is there now.
Nothing is possible in a fish com."
A scrale example, a short world image, -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I took it works better better better I understood that this fish is the same smart is smart.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the fish com is the fish crossing to create possibilities, you have no freedom.
If you get the fish cross the way to create possibilities to create the fewer and make your less tacks.
It leads to more lost and less teaching and less tester to the packs.
Everybody has a fish senke.
This is free to reads -- possible even for the fise, but certainly for us.
But the shake of a figure out of a figure out of a figure out of a figure out and awful -- unheil.
Thank you very much.
