I was a little year, I showed these two dia's to show that the Poice cap, who was the Poice was the past three million years of the vastate of the United States, 40 percent of the United States, 40 percent of the United States,
But this is actually the nice of this specific problem because it doesn't show the ice.
The ice ap on the North Pole is in a certain sense, in the clopping heart of our global climate system.
It turns out in the summer, and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide I showing is a dester version of what happened the last 25 years is happening for 25 years is happening.
The permanent ice is red.
As you see, it out of dark blue.
That's the year, the year, the jury of the winter.
And the srimpt in the summer.
The so-called ice, five years of older and a floor, five years of blood is that from the body, that from the body, that from the body.
In 25 years is it from this to this go.
And that is a problem because the free-frozen frozen frozen in the North Ictually from, and there's a very large amount of woman's woman's frote by meth, when it was dedeath, and the death of methane.
Comming the total amount of diverversity in the atmosphere, that could be considered to be able to describe as we consider the point of described the point of the tility of the atmosphere.
In some indeepe in Alaska himself methane in Alaska in the water.
And the last winter was Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another ondie-ondie-indeep to another ondie.
Whoo! It's OK. The question is the question is going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be there.
A reason for that is that this huge of warm-bron" Greenland from the north-warming.
This is a smelt river twater river of them.
The watering volume is the water-evolved greater than own.
This is the Kangerlussion.
If you want to know how the sea is the sea because the agricultually mel, it's the place where it is in the sea place where it comes in the sea and the sea
These are neighborhood on fluence.
And the other side of the planet, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice mass on Earth.
And the last months of reported scientists that the whole continent now a negative ice balance is that the whole continent now,
More specific is the ice in the West of the South Pole very quickly, very quickly, and a few of underwatering different water-ilands.
The whole continent is to see, sea is a lot of seat, just like Greenland.
In the Himalaya, the two of ice ice ice mass and a few years ago, there are new now, who were still glets;
40 percent of the global population is the half of his drein-water water of that melties.
In the Andes, is this glestjer the source of drinking water for this city.
There's more floor.
But when they disappearing the drink water.
In California was a further of 40 percent in the snow of the Sierra.
It comes in the water-reservoires of the waters.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions of it.
This global dreamed dreamed to a dramatic foot of forbrands.
And the number of course, the number of course, is spot with an incredible and never seen seen in the world.
Four time in the last 30 years, in the last 30 years,
This pattern is completely unlike that.
If you look at the bottom of a historic context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 tons every 24 hours every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, you look at the operating area of the Stille of the Stille of the Stille of the India, and on every single south of Indian subcontinent to the oceans, there's a stic dalation of the oceans.
The only big cause of the Earth, the earth, the deforest, which is 20 percent of the earth, is the source of fossil fuel of fossil fuel of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and the coal is the very largest problem.
The United States is one of the two biggest extension, together with China.
And there was a predictor of building a lot more urban carbon centrales.
But we see a cirmace.
These are the cottools that the blown was annuated in the last years, and where larger alternatives were annuttrients were precedented forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget in the last years,
There's a political freezes in the gang in our country.
The urban carbon -- and oil industry gave years to promotion, 250 million dollars to promotion, which is a contraving.
And that picture was a picture of me thinking about something that picture.
And the guy was the churner in Tennessee, about four billion literally four billion literally belied.
You probably seen it in the news of the news of news.
This is the one of largest decade in America.
This happened around the Kerst.
One of the advertising cooking linked around the Kerster was the Kerster was the Kerster was the Kerstine.
Video: ""Frosty the cotman is a stair.
He is fluence about here in America, and he cards here in America, and he causes our economy.
Frosty the cotman is screen with the day screen.
He is paid and well-up and employees and employee."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia of Virginia of day's days.
The largest minker, the largest minside of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship is "Let me be clear, "Let me be Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Rey, they don't know where they have.
Al Gore: So the Alliance of Klimate,
This is a piece of a one.
Video "Bue COALergy, we see the climate change as a serious dress our business for our business.
And that is the reason is the most important pursue to give a gigantic behavior to the light of the light of true and the regular policy of truth about voting bice.
Fim is not smarke.
We find that it is swimprices -- and it read is a cker cook.
So, you don't make carry about climate change.
Let me just show you about it.
Video: Acteur: Schone coal, you have heard a lot about it.
So let's look at this hypermodern of this hypermodern cool-carbon centrale.
Fantastic! The machines are doing a little bit of lai.
But that's the sound of sound cool.
In thanks the fact that the fact that the branks of the most important causes of the most important warming warming of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth, the remarkable of the Earth,
Look a look at the time is the shapes carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually the positive alternative alternative alternative alternational safe.
Video: M: America selling in crisis, the national security is the national security the climate crisis.
The red rate in all these things, is our dependence of fossil fuel sandsts and the independent coal and indestim olid of oil,
But now there's a new solution of it is a new solution to get out of this.
Worth America is a 100 percent of swell-co-celetricity, in 10 years.
A plan to get to the work to get to work and get a plan that makes us safer and the option of the Earth, and the opportunity of the Earth.
And in the solution that requires of consider to solve our problems.
Repower America. As is the way to do it.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: I, it's about the America to give America to give America
One of the speed ways to make an end, to our dependence of old sources that our planet, and they can help our planet, to help our planet.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, sun, a new energy system.
Man 2: Nuwe are investments to create jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to become realistic
Al Gore: There's an old African old African speaking word says, "If you want to be all the way to be all of it.
If you want to go far far with it.
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
I was a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promised to come back with a update about how that machine works.
So I am here is the biggest of the ones that didn't waren: The largest scientific experiment ever scientific experiment ever in engaged in engaged in engaged in the entertain-brib.
It has to be the circumstances that were involved less than a billion.
Enorm ambitius, thus!
This is the machine Geneves.
We took these photographs of that mini-Big Bang's in detectors that I work. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meter in diameter in diameter.
Spectacular picture of ATLAS in the scale.
At 10 september of last year, we put the machine for the first time.
This photograph was taken by ATLAS.
That is a partnership in the control room in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of the first particle that all around the way from LHC gings and set up with a piece of the LHC, which is a piece of the LHC, which was flowing in the detector of the set of flowed in the detect of the LHC,
In other words, when we were saying that picture on 10 September we knew that the machine working is a huge overcome in the machine is a huge overcome in the machine is a huge over.
I don't know if this is the largest across the largest across and then somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page of saw that the Internet page of saw that the Internet pages.
That means we made a kind of a cultural as a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a scientific impact of a both of a scientific impact as a scientific impact of a scientif
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which had to make this gold behaviors.
They were 13 thousand of ample of ample of ample of competition when the machine on full force of entire power.
The engineers will say, "Not true you, "Not true. It's too small be."
They can do that because they can do that because they can be superago, in a very lower temperatures.
So in 271 degrees of chealth, the space between the stars, that can reach the behavior.
In one of the connective of the neine of nine in the LHC, was a constructive in the LHC, was a constructive forest.
And it turns out the wire was a warmer, and there was intended to 13 thousand ample of ampeers.
This was the result.
This is still impressive your realizes if you realize that that that magnets over 20 tons of the magnets of 20 tons of the purching of the magnets of the magnets of the magnets of them were moving to be moved about 30 centimeter of the magnets of them are going to be moved in the magnets of them --
We civil we cident civil about 50 mongnets.
We had to do them out of it, what we did it.
We all requirement.
Now they're backwards up again.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We will take it again, and we expect to measure and we can go into you, so we can go and look at the expect of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, the debate again, the debate again in the value of scientific research of scientific research of scientific research of the scientific research of the value of the value of the value of scientific resear.
I think it's a fact that it's so difficult that we go further than the LHC.

Thank you.
I would like to start to ask you back to your children back to your children at your children when you played with blocks.
And when you discovered how to grab them up to grab up and bewed up and conscious to solve the conscious relations.
Ruimtely insight is a strong because of the world to understand of the world to understand it.
If an information is an information inspired by the physical interact with objects -- with objects -- with objects -- with my advisor Pattion and my fashion Jeein Kalanithi -- what if we could use a computer -- what we would use a computer of engineering on angle that we could have a computer that we could define with the individual finger in a plant charge of information that we can fly squipment with information of information that we can describes with with with with with with the information
and ordering ordering the one?
These question, that we decided to figure that we decided to go to visit by building the building of Siftables.
Cort cooking is a Sifttable to interactive computer in a cow-cooky.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel each other, they can feel their movement and they decided to be able to the squire contact contact of the wireless contact of the dozen contact of the hand they can felt each other, and they can feel together with the hand and they can fellow out of the dozen and they can felt each other, and they can actually feless each other, and they can actually put each other.
The nuclear understanding is the physical handelblocks as blocks can they get into the blocks can be moved by grab.
Bovendies are Siftables a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
Now, this helping tools a more physical different, conscious of their movement and each other, and even of the way that we move them moving and such interact of interactions.
I will start with some simple examples of a simple example of the ones of a single example of the one-simple example of the simple examples.
This Sifttable is to tell a video of a video and provide to opportunity and others played by changing and others played by the changs of celerate.
These interactive portraits of each other.
Indians are put together each other, they will interest to each other.
If they are surround, they can also become this and can be a nervous weight.
And they feel movement and helling.
We realized algaued that one of the interesting consequences of this interacti, the use of the interacti, as it exclude of a color as it was a fluid of a well-up-in-of.
In this example of these example of these examples of balances and I can use them to go into color in a very very much.
If we have threat of the three, we went back to the back.
There are some of a crap possibilities for education, especially played game with language and logics that we want to give people the possibility to be able to probert, and the result of immediately set of the result of incently.
Here I -- this is the development of a Fibonacci series by a simple computation program.
Here we show a game that a cross between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every single of the willl-up letter in every Siftable, and the cause of the words are controlled in a dictionary words,
After about 30 seconds it's very screamed to be very screamed a new series of motension.
Thank you.
These are some of a few kids on the Media Lab, and I slowed them to make it out to make it and make a video of it.
They were actually actually away from it.
And one of the most interesting things of this application is that people nearly not needed instructions of these approach.
Everything that you have to say is "Move word" and they know exact what to do.
Here are some other people on the testing.
That's our bottta tester, right?
And it turns out that he was living the Siftles.
For him this blocks.
Here's an interactive painting.
We wanted to develop a platform for teaching language of language
This is Felix that demonstrate demonstrt.
He can bring new carakters in the scene of the Siftable with that character of the table,
Here he shows the sun up.
Video: The sun comes up.
David Merrill: Now he has a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scen
Video: The orange tractor.
God dy! Yeah!
And by Sifttles, and the near purpose to each other, he can respond to each other, and make the carry!
DM: and so his own storytell.
Video: Hallo!
DM: It's a story with a pully.
and he decided to go away.
Video: The cat fly away.
DM: The last example I will show you to, I will show you a synthesizer and live music in that we developed develop, every Sifttables and pressed a sound product like the lead, basic and presses.
Eender has four different variations, where you can choose what you want to use what you want to use it.
These sounds can be injected in a very high Siftles, so you can determines the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by a very Sifttable effects of a lot of controllabor, and filter.
They are going to be a sound devices and access by changing with office.
And the general effects like tempo and volume that are allowed to the whole pattern.
Let's look at it.
Video: DM: We start with a liad in two Siftables, to a first pattern to a first pattern by a very first pattern,
Now I read the basline.
Video: DM: DM: I'm feeding a little beat a little beat the time.
Video: DM: And now I copy the filter of the print, so I can influence.
Video: DM: I can spend it very quickly, the office blocks.
Video: DM: DM: I'm heading the filter of what more more expression.
Video: DM: I can reached the pattern as it playing.
So I don't have to planns, but I can improvise to the very longer and shorter as I want to do it.
In the end of the dimms of the dimms of the volume Sifttable to the left Sifttles.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion, my passion, my passion, my interfaces that are better interfaces in the way our brain and botttes.
And today, I had the time to show you one new element in this design area of consider to show you one possibilities that we develop developing in the lab.
The thought, that I want to talk about is that this only is the attace to a very new generation of aid resources for the interacting with digital media, that we want.
I thank you to thank you.
I look at all.
I'm writing.
Buks write is my work, but also so much more than that.
My whole life I am writing for a long time and I don't think that ever will ever change that ever ever ever ever write will ever change
And yet the way that is a property in my life and career in my life and career with my work again.
It started with a book that I wrote unnership, a memoire: "Ets, Bident, Bid, in fact, that very in contratratrain to my first work around and an international existence and an international existence of international exist.
And the consequence is that people have to be touched to be told me as if I do do do with it.
And the thing that -- member!
People come to me and ask to me and ask to ask this success you never never will eat this success will never be able to equip?
Don't you afraid you will stay write your whole life will never be a book that people will never be able to write in warm.
Don't you get to be afraid this?"
Erg reeful right, you know.
Of course, that would be very write I remember 20 years ago, I was a little bit about 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,
People said, "Don't you get success that you never will get succes?
Don't you get to deal for education, that you will go to such on it.
Don't you afraid your life on this work will be able to evidence without that there ever something that that you will be able to deal with your licks with your lick?"
Something in that streting.
In the short comes to ask up to this questions on this novely on this one.
Yes, I'm afraid for all these things that are enough that are enough of things.
All of the time already everything that is all the time.
But I'm also a lot of other things that are a lot of other things that for everything.
For sea for sea whose and other engineer, and other things.
But what is writing is writing myself the last time when that come from.
Is it ration?
Is it logical that somebody is eight to be a jobs to be able to work for their opinion, they are see?
What is so particular about creative processes that we make make sure to the effects of the mind of the mind-assuming thing that is not happening to be able to other,
You can take my father. He was scales scales engineer, and I can't remember that there was in the 40 years he worked on him that he was working on him that was not afraid to him that was not afraid to be afraid in the 40-year--old on-old hurt my fa
And this is, "Yeah, how is it with your chemist?"
No, not set up in it.
To be fair to be fair republic engineers have been solid by the centuries of the centuries of manic-depressive coholist-guy depressive coholide.
Scheating what is that have such a reputation.
Not only writers writer, even other creative people have been pretty instable, the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of people have been a very writing.
Look at the grim of the most magnife death the most magnic creative mind of the 20th century.
Many of cheattery young, often by own own own own own own own own stiers,
And even the ones that no suicians who don't cut up to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave pully.
In the last interview for his death said, "My Mailer: "Meat each of my books is a little bit of my books is a little bit of myself."
That's a little bit of a little bit about your life-work.
But of this kind of extensive to look at it.
We all heard of the first time and have heard it with all accepted with all accepted.
The connected to be a connected creativity is that creativity innecessary with list and that a artistide of the list will read to telling.
So I want to ask anyone here today I ask to that idea idea of life?
Do you do that?
Because I think I think about it, I think about it, I don't think I don't think it's a very front of daught in the whole daches.
I like to find the reflect.
And even even though though to be a dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century is so good.
We can creative mind to be a lot better than to live a lot better to live in a lot better than to live a lot better than to live a lot better than to live a lot better than to live.
I know sure it for me, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, to be a dangerous family familiar attention to live in the dark in the dark for me to live in the dark of mine, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation, in my situation,
Seker the fase in which my career is in my career on my career is now in the fase in which my career is in the fase in which my career is in the fase in which my career is in which my career is in which my career in which my career is in which my career
Go took me you, I'm still young amount of year.
I can go through decades of decades.
And so, the heavy will be all of the audiences of the outside world as the work that followed in that outside outside of successful book.
And we are here with friends under each other, so I can selling you you the wheels of the griggest success of the griggest success of me.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about that if you think of the morning is in the morning to the morning, and all the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love me to be a job that I love the work that I love the work I love it.
The question is, "Hoo?"
And after long after a long time I think I can just go to conclusion that I can just go to write a psychological protection in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of conclusion in the process of the process of conclusion that I can just go to a psychological protect of a long
I have to write the write of a safe distance between myself and my concerned in the future of the reactions, and my future publics.
I had been looking at ways to do it.
I'm in history and I do in history and have me deeping in other civilizations to see or others to see or others a better way to help creative people to help with the emotional complications of creative process.
My visit was going to be able to the old Greeks and Rom.
And I walk up because it's a long and intricked story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Roman didn't believed that creativity was from honself.
And I believed that creativity was a god-de-party, that of a destiny place to the human engineering for the ment, to the human reasons.
The Greeks called these Greeks called these these clears of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had a demoon that he had
The Romends had a species of the same idea.
In them of the creative creative creative medicative member.
The funny is that the Rominal is not a genius to a genius for a genius of a genius for a genius of a genius for a genius of a genius of a genius of a genius of a genius for a genius.
In their police was a genius of a magic god-magical god-entitt entities that were solved in the walls of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest entitled in the walls of the ateler of the poorest entities that was a genius of the ateltion was a genius of the atelling entit
A little like Dobs in the house is a little bit of the house.
If the artists was working was a genia genius assistance.
And it turns out he gave the work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first other about the psychological protection against the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that in his work was going to be in his work thing.
The artists was so in protected for example of narcism.
If you were brilliant, you don't get to the eer.
Everybody knew that was an invisible genion,
Whereas you cut up and then you get that not just to you.
Everybody knew that you had a pretty undedependent genion.
Long time is that had been considered how in the West, creativity was consider.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed in the Renaissance,
There was a very new idea: the individual human being: the individual human point of the universe and the mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, intended from the god-in-de-ash world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity was completely of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual flow.
And for the first time in history was in history was about artists said that they were not a genion, and they didn't have a genion.
I have to say I think I have to say that a big front of the big front of the major of a big front of the great front of the great front of the wrong.
To one person, one person, one one, one individual of the century of that he or she is write the secur, the source of the century mystery, of everything that is that creative and known known for a very responsibility of responsibility for a fragile of a fragility for a fragile of responsibility for a fragile of responsibility of everything that is to make a framult of responsibil
Alsketch somebody asks to sket.
Ego's become up to gigantic proportions and there are increasingly expectangic proportions of prestations to prestently copy.
And I think this pressed the last 500 years of artists of poor poor capable of poor capability.
If that is, and I think is the question is, "What is?"
Can we do this differently.
Can we return back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the human being?
Maybe not.
We can do can we have 500 years rational humanism not undone in a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes of game speech.
And the probably of the audience people who are reached scientific numbers of the idea that elers, the idea that elerables with what faces in the fact that eleras, and bring the work of dotes.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in that I will get you in that way.
And I wonder I wouldn't ask me.
Why isn't it?
Why wouldn't we do that consider to do that?
It is just as much as much hold as much of the totally catch making the totally calcular that decided in creative process.
Everybody who have to try to create something -- so in fact, all the amazing of this -- you know that the creative process doesn't always rational process to rational process doesn't always rational rational regular process of all.
And that the sometimes the paranormistry.
I have the great American closer to the amazing American closer and is a front of the great.
She is a close in the nine.
She told me about her youth of Virginia.
Soms, if she was felt the work was felt in the field of working on the country.
It was so she said, "Well, if there was a big wave air.
And so the close wave than the country to her country to her device.
She felt the ground, the ground, and she knew that was started to do that moment and he knew her at that moment but one thing to do is that when it was stony to her life.
And she ran to home, and they were slightly soon as quickly as quickly as quickly and see paper and see paper and see paper and see paper and then see the paper and then they could see as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as qu
When it close to be close by her hand her hand her only opportunity to write it on the way to write it on the waves of the poem of waves.
Sometimes she didn't quickly.
Then soil, but reaches it doesn't move the house.
And in such a poems, the close of her him, and set up the fields, looking for a lot of the fields, in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her
And then I think of it was a beautiful part of the story -- I think that they were going to be the close of the story -- that they were going to be the close of the story --
And then she was in house to look for paper and paper, and shed the paper and shed the paper of her him.
Jue at that point she had a potleg of paking.
And with her other hand, so she told me them, she pluked the close of the air.
She paked the close to his tail, and it back into her body, and it back into her body, and she wrote it again.
And in that cases came up with the purch, in my sense, in my beautiful paper, but then in the paper of the paper in the paper of the paper of the paper,
And when I heard that -- what is accident, I thought my creative process ey!
This is how my creative proces! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth of a mouth, that every day on the same time check and sweat, and trans with blood and trans and trans on the botttty.
But even in that daily swell-swed such a experience of a experience of a such of experience.
You will also know it to know it you, that sense that there is a creative ideas in your board of releasing from a source of sources that you can identify impossible in your bottttom.
What is that they are that for fun for fun to be fun for fun for fun of fun for fun for fun for fun of fun for fun for fun for fun for fun for fun for fun for fun for fun of fun for fun for fun for fun for fuon?
How can we use it without that we get it without that we have a ce?
And in a way that is?
The best contemporaine example that I can think of this is musician's musician Tom Was.
A few years ago I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it about this.
Tom is a big part of his life was a big part of his life was showing the toonce of the contemporary artists that are trying to get out of all the power of the power of the uncertain of the unbehind to impulse up in him up.
And the ''d be a little bit of the back.
And one day he was in Los Angeles about the freed, and changed the process of radical race.
And as he heard there, he heard a fragment, he heard a melodie.
The decided that is a inspiration that is a father, ingrab, crowd.
It was a beautiful melothor.
But it doesn't go to that.
He didn't have no paper touch, no paper at a tperecorder to be a table to see a tperecorder to be a tperecorder to be a tperecorder to be a tangle of appear in it.

June Cohen: Oh, righ!
You know, I had been talking about a few of these projects, about a few of these projects, about the human genome and what that can mean and discovering new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to the digitizing of digitizing that digital code to a new fase in the biology of biology in biology and synthesizing of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions of ask the big question.
"What is life?" is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different levels of biologists have tried to understand in different level?" is a life?" is something that I think is a lot of life?"
We tried to have different approaches to left back to minimal components.
We're almost 20 years of digitize in the digitize of digitize
And when we have the human genome of the human genome, it was from the analoge world of the analoge world of the computer.
Now we try to ask for question, can we live in regenerate, or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organized Mycoplasma genitalium with the smallest gene genome, with the smallest genome for a kind of a laboratory in a laboratory of a laboratory of a laboratory genitself in a laboratory genitself in a laboratory of a laboratory gen
And we tried to look at if we can get to a little inter.
We can go in the order of hundred genes out of the 500 or both both of the 500 or both of the 500 or both of the 500 or both of the 500 or both of it.
But if we look at metabolical map of map card, is a relatively relatively relatively remoderly with the use.
Gelme, this is simply easy.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check a piece of ceasy that this would be a living cell that this would be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell of the genes that would be a living cell cell to be a single cell to all the genes that would be a living cell cell that this
And we decided to do that the only route of the only route to synthesizing this chromosome of components to make the components to make the components to be a couple of the most fundamental question.
And so we started asking questions like this? "Can we started a chromosome of synthis?
Stage the chemistry to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, can a chromosome "war mosphere?
A chromosopm is just a piece of chemically, a piece of chemical.
So, our tempo of digitize of digitize of life is accelated in exponential wise.
Our ability to write the genetic code of a long slose slowly slowly slowly slow-to-slow-side.
And our last point it would be in this moment in a moment in a moment of exponential curve.
And we started here over 15 years ago,
There were some of a couple of stages for a bioethical ethical ethical action,
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult.
There are 10 thousands of machines in the world that little pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length, and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it more felt you make more from.
So we had to make a new method for the little pieces of these little pieces and corrigating all the front of all the front of the wrong.
And this was our first poging, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X-174.
That's a small of virus that bacteria tiny so.
We designed the pieces of the pieces, the foutcorrections
and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a chemical chemical strain in the bacteria and the bacteria genetions of the genetions and virtually make a genetions of the genetions of things.
The virale particles were going to be able to losed out of the cells, they came back and death the E. coli.
I was unlong in conversation with the oil industry, and I said that model but I said that model it was to well.
They laugh more than you laught for more than you.
So we think this is a situation that this is a situation in which the software can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something biggers.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
That's more than 580,000 letters genetic code.
So we decided to build them in cassetttor of viruses, so we could various the cassetttta --
to understand what the thing that the kind of considered components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start with digital information in the computer than that to be very accuraff that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that we have to be very accure.
When we first of all, this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard exactly one mistakes a 10,000 based.
And the entire sequencing after resequencing the original sequence, it was not in the way of sequence.
And part of the design, the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to consider with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can design so that they can design so that that they can design together to design so that that they can go together to build together to make together to design so that they can do together with all the other pieces of the design.
We design here is unique in fact,
Maybe you have been adapted that we put watermarks in the watermarks in it.
Bet, we have a four-literal genetic code: A, C, Ge: A, Ge: A, Gee-and T.
Trio's of that letters code for the pipment of the piinod of the aminoxyouth of every aminoxyouth of every aminoxyyous.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, swriting the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the geneti
Avantage of signal we have to do just me.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no closing close to fall of it.
We have these pieces of these pieces that we can eat them with enzyes.
There are answers that they repairs and put together and put together.
And we started to make pieces of sun, we started with pieces that were five to 7,000 letters were able to 7,000 letters of each other, and you take a 24,000 letter, and then sets of 24,000 letter, to 72,000.
In every stage of every stage we could have a floor, so we could sequences them because we could sequences a process of a process of cropic -- that will be very robb.
We try to do the point of automatisions.
So this looks like a basketbalfinale.
And as we get to the really big pieces -- more than 100,000 basement -- more than 100,000 basement in E. coli.
That explains the most of modern tools of modern tools of molecular biology.
So we went to reach with other mechanisms.
We know a mechanism that "homolo-od-od-od-od-co-in-foot of DNA to repairs, that can add up with DNA can add together and put them together by the biology of the home.
Here's an example of it.
There's an organized Deincentive Deinocococcus radio of radio radiation of radiation on the radiation of radiation on the radiation of the radiation of the radio of radio durans of the radio of radio durans are an organized in the way.
You see that you in the top panel, shed in the top panel, sopm just out of each other.
12 ot 24 hours later, he put it again in each other, and then it was first of all.
There are thousands of organizes that these ares.
These organisms can be drood.
They can live in a vacuum of life.
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can profit can promove to move a new aquatic environment.
NASA has been seen that there is a lot of the way, there is a lot of it.
Here's a kind of indeed, you know, this is a molecule that we made with these processes -- fact that we made with these processes -- fact with the right design, with the right design, which we did them in the right design.
Gree is that they feed automatically concerned of automatically concerned
This is not an electron-microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, genomes about a period of six seconds.
This is the audiences that we spent ungluds.
This is more than 580,000 letters on genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a human, with a clear,
The molecule-weight is more than 300 million.
If we would press it with a 10-point letter, without spations, then there is 142 pages of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of it.
Now, how do we starting to go a chromosphere?
And with a virus is the clearly very sickly easy of a virus of a virus of a virus of a virus of a virus of a virus of a virus of a virus of a virus of a square a very swire of a virus of virus is a very clear.
And with a bacteria is a lot of intricion.
It's also simpler if you give you your eukaryots, like wis: you while, you just know the cell and do another in, and do another in, and that's what you know when you know as the clones.
And in the bacteria is the chromospher, the chromosome of cell, but we have to show a full transplant to be a full transplant transplant to a chromosopm of a cell transportation of a cell to a other, and we can extend to a different and activity.
We have a chromosopm south of a micro-size species.
These are about so far of each other people and mics.
We feed what extra genes that we could take for this chromosome of this chromosome of chromosome of this chromosome of this chromosome.
We have to make it with enzymes to make all the protein to make all the protein to make all the protein of the protein of the protein and make all the protein and make all the protetein of the protein of the protein and make all the proteted.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will put the very advanced graphic imagery -- the new chromosome of that -- the new chromosome of the cell.
We even thought he would come to set it would come to set it to go and try to develop the process of process what further is going to develop the process of what further further out of it.
This is an essential evolutionary evolutionary mechanism.
We found all kinds of species that have a second chromospher, or a third chromosome of day, where they thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People that evolution is predictions like one of the equipment, not have a lot of biology in the same thing that is going to be a lot of biology changes to be a lot of biology changes to be a lot of biology changes of that are not a lot of biology changes of the equally evolved.
There's enzymes that restricti-enzyms that are actually enought DNA is define.
The chromospheric that was not a cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromospher, we put in in the cell --
It was expressing the other chromosome of the chromospheric as peace of material, and we had the cell of the new chromosophim.
He was blue from the genes that we had put in in the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time to be soft the characteristics of one species, and changed in the new species, and changed in the new software that we put in the cell we put in the cell of the cell of the cell.
All the protected changes, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code of which it was changed in which it was changed.
This is a main software alchemistry, but we are in state, in the software of the software are DNA, to change things fundamentally changes.
Good, I paid for first time that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is prefors in 3.5 billion years evolution, and I paid painted that we may be able to a new version of Camic explosion of that there are large scale new species of scale new species of calculation of the engineering new species of cample new species.
Why would you do it?
I think it's pretty clearly if you look at what is need.
We go into the next 40 years, from the next 40 years, over the next 40 years.
To put it in my context in my context of the 1946.
There's three people on this planet---
for each of us who live in 1946; within 1946, in 40s, that there are four four there.
We have to have food with food of numbers of clean water, medicine, medicine, medicine,
That's really really really really to do that for next.
We use five billion tons of coals, more than 30 billion of oil.
That's 100 miloons of freezes a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or whatever process than also to replace; then it is going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, all these carbon dioxide of the stine that is in the atmosphere.
And with all of our global discoveries we have a database of about 20 million genes, and that I would like to see as the designer components for the future.
The electronics had only a dozen of components, and look at the diversity that is coming from that is coming from that is prevented from there.
We are preserved by an biological reality and our imagination.
We have techniques of techniques of synthesesemethods to be so-called combination genomics of combination genomics
We now have the possibility to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
If you think about the transfurther you think about 20 million different genes or tries to optimalizing to produce or drugs to produce or medicine, new vaccins, we can change with a small team of molecular biology than in the last 20 years of the science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can select for lives, chemical or fuel of life, chemical or fuel production, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen imagination of what real designer designer that we work on the gang of what we can actually go to the gang and a new kind of design and a new kind of design and a new kind of design.
We don't know person how it will see out of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code of disease.
We founded to fourth of the field of fuel that we found.
On your floor, you have seen to ethanol experiment.
We have second and third generation that will come into the sugar, will come out of sugar, to more high and more high and a different fuel of butanoli.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence in food and consider the food price and the available and the available is as we begin with CO2 as we begin to be the first food of the first food of that we do the first fourth of the first fourth of the first fourth of the first generation of fuel generation and in about 18 months and in about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our global discoveries -- but by our global respective of other methods.
This is an organizm that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2.5 miles of mile deep, in cokens.
It makes methane of CO2 with molecular water-water-frequires as energy source of molecular water-frequire.
We are looking at the way or we can take CO2 and we can take a pippeeing of the pipes can be able to fall of the CO2 to fuel into fuel to fuel to burn to be able to invitial this process to send this process to send this process to send this process to send this process to send this process to
So in a short of a short of a short of the basic question, "What is life?"
We have a very matters, you know -- the deaths are the petrochemical industry of the petrochemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED -- where they do it?
A important energy source of energy source of energy source of energy source of energy source of energy source.
But we now work on the way to do this tools to think about these tools to think about vaccines of vaccines in the front of these tools.
This year there was the flow, we always just just a little bit behind the facts of the facts of the right vaccine.
I think that can change that change from texty, combined vaccines of the text.
Here you see how the future can see the future can see the evolutionary tree, the evolution tree, the accelerating bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We are still far away of improve of people.
Our goal is certainly to concerned to survive for long enough to survive to do that might be able to do that well.
What I want to show you as a first time is the fundament of a new technology that we can bring to Microsoft to Microsoft -- this is Seedragon. This is Seedragon.
And it's a surround, in which you can work in your local or at the immense of visual data can work in the way.
We look at the time here is many gigabytes to digital images and can sit up to stay and except the sorters and except the sorters and the sorters to our wish and the sorters.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information, how big these collections or images.
Most of them are normal camera photographs, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 megapix.
It makes anything that because it is the only thing that would be influence, and the floor, the amount of pixeless is in the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a very example of non-picture data.
This is the grain house is a grain house is a headdress a headdress a headdress piece.
To prove that it is really text, and no picture, and no picture, we can do something that is really text, to show that this is not a picture.
Maybe this is a little bit of a strange way to read a e-book.
I wouldn't be the job.
This is a realistic. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of a subject of a submercial.
This is really a real pleasure and the experience of a real papers of a real papers or newspaper, which is actually a scale medium of medium is.
We also have something that we did something that we have done with the game of the Guardian.
We have a nep advertention of high resolution -- a lot of higher than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information.
If you want to see the possibilities of this car, you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure that we can actually make the limitations of hands through the screen of the square the screen.
We hope this is not going to be popular flaul -- not need to be more flaul -- not need to be more needed to be more more of it.
Of course are amaps a long long line is a hand is a lot of access of technology like this: I will not spend up here to this field, except that we can also behavided a lot of the well.
These are all the weain the U.S.
and put on top of a picture of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now a live on the Web; you can look at the Web; you can look at it.
This project is called Photosynth, who is two techniques of each other.
One of them is Seadragon and the other is a very beautiful computer vision of Noah Snavely, profiddle is in the University of Washington, reached by Steve Seitz on U.W.
and Rick Sriski at Microsoft Research.
So this is live on the Web. It's the possible of Seadragon.
When we do this -- you see that we can see the images of the images and the multi-resolution of the images of the images of the images.
The space is the space of the images of the images of the images of the images.
The computer vision is algorithms, so that they were built to the real space -- that they required the Grassi Lakes in the Canadean Rockies -- where they're genome.
I don't know if there is a time or there is other environments.
There are a lot of space televisier.
I want to show one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth, we actually worked -- to communicate this summer, to communicate what I in my head is the real force of this technique of the engineering power of the environments on our website of the environments on our website.
We had to do with the advocates and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame with pictures of Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get you to see images from Flickr.
And each of these orange chirs a picture of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of model that was part of this model of this model of a picture of this model of this model of this model of this orange chest.
And so these are all Flickr picture, which is copied in this way of copyped space.
And we can actually took in easy easy education.
You know, I never thought I would never have thought I ever would ever work to work in Microsoft would work on Microsoft.
It's overwhelmed to be so unclear.
I believe you can see that this many types of camera's cameras, everything from gloflex, a big number of it, a big number of it,
I'll try to find some weird images.
There are so much working by facing faces and so much as well.
Ers between this is even a series of photos -- here's here --
This is even a poster of the Notre Dame that is churns also with the program.
If we have fall the poster in a physical picture of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment, this is now the data -- of everyone -- of the whole collective memory of how to see -- and heading couple of the entire collective memory that everything to each other.
All these photos are considered together and shapes a very little bigger than the songs of the parts.
You have a model that that from the whole Earth,
As a consequences of Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Earth.
And this is something that growth in complexity when they use the use, and what the preparts of the people who grow it.
Their own photographs are going to be somebody else inved.
If somebody would like somebody would like to climb and their names and their names and their names of the Notre Dame is ringing that data, and I can use it as a different access to the space, and created a mettana versum usual versum usual exhibitor, and created a kind of cruis-modalready social experience.
And of course, the be-product of this imments rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, who is not just from air photos, satelling imagery and other applies is to be unfortune from the collectively memory and other approaches from the collective memory is a considering of the collective pes, and other applies of the internal model of any of the interesting place of the power of the entire place of the things that is is that rich in the entions of the collectively of the ptions of each thing of the collectively of thing that is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is that ry.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand that what your software possible in the next years, in the next years, in the next years, all the images that can copping in the next year, can copping together by everybody can copp?
BA: Yeah. What this is discovered is discovering.
It creates to your wish, hyperlinks of the hyperlinks of images.
And it does that basis of the data in the data in the data in the pictures.
And that is going to be exciting when you think about the richchches of the wealth of semantic information that many of these imagines.
When you look at the web is looking for images, you feel a vision and the text, and the text, and the text on the webpage of information about what the imagination.
What if you cut that picture is copated to all your imagination?
And then the number of substantial connections and the amount wealth of wealth that comes from that comes from that that comes from that that comes from that that is a classic network effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicition.

The science that Jay Jay shamans still the Milky galay whether that the mythes of Inchest-old meant of the Himalaya boodom, or that in the Himalay whether in the breaths of Dhar, you remember that we are not going to be in an absolute of anthropology: the world we don't have a sing, but is not a single model of the ance of the angle model of the angle model of the and,
the consequence of a device set of passions that we made our ancestors generations of ago made our ancestors of the ancestors of a considered to our ancestors of a consequences of a devices that we made our ancestors of a devices that we have been able to be a consequence.
Of course, we all share the same adapted dest: World Breng children in the world. Brenrenged children in the world.
We make all inducation rites in the world.
And the including including the inevition.
So it can't rassing that we all sings, and they can have all singing, and thank and art.
But the most interesting is the uniquely of the song of the song of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is about the Penan in the wold on Borne, or the Voodom, or the Vood-Cur, or the freeders in Haiti in North Kaisute in North Kenya, the Curb-base of the Art of the Caravanai in the heart of the Sahart of the Sahart of the desert -- this is the device,
Everyway, the godin-mother of the world.
They all learn that we can be different, we can think of other, can think of the orient.
If you think about it, this idea you can just give you a lot of it.
Samen shapes the intelligence cultures in a web of spiritual and culture, and the planet and the planet is as important as important as it is as important as the biological life: the biosphere.
This cultural lifewar you can imagine your imagining as a enos;
The enosed of the foot of the thought, if the totally of all the thought, dreams, myths, and the inspirations and inspirations and intuitions that are previous imagination since the human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness of our consciousness.
The enos: The eatentire of humanity.
And she's the symbol we can be and all that we can be as amazing and all that we can be a bigger animals.
Not like the biosphere is the food, is the evice, is the evice, and even in a lot of larger mate.
No biologist, would be the surface that least at least of all kinds of the species of extinction because that simply doesn't where simply anyway.
And the most apocalyptic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhood, in the neighborhood, in the neighborhoods.
The best indicator of this is the losing of this is the loss.
And when everybody here was born there, and they were born six-thousand of the earth of them on Earth.

Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some of a few question of that I have a book that I had a book in a book of the well.
Maybe you see paralls with information of information from other sources.
I try to explain some of a connected that you might have a bad of light.
I want to start with the "official dogma."
To be exactly to be the official dogma of all the wester, industrialized society.
And that official dogma is aware as follow-follow-to-gth levels on the highest level, we have to get them as much as possible to give them as much as possible to give them as much as much as possible to give them as much as much as possible to be able to give them so much as possible to give them
Peopment is a big cheap, a big cheap, an essential part of the human exist.
And the freedom of freedom is to treat the point to do a higher well-to-good-to-of performance of third to do without inment.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice.
More choices in that people have more freedom of freedom of choices in that people have more freedom of choices in that people have more freedom of choices in that people have more freedom of choices are freedoing.
And more freedom means of automatically more maping more performance.
This is so deep in our society that no one would be able to expanding that no one would be able to felt in our society that no one one of our society that no one of our society that nobody would be in our society that no one of the way.
And in our life is this dogma urban is a piff four.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket.
Even about dressings.
And the most of them that 175 off-class are threats in my supermarkets of these things are extra-virgin the supermarks of virtual brid-up and twico's transportation.

So this is the packed of my supermarket.
Look at electronics wins. You can make your star-eoset of them -- aware -- amazing cassion, cassetttesper radio strong.
As one electronics are going to be able to choose out of this tap.
You can make six-a-half million systems, with with parts of these store.
Give -- you have a lot of choic.
As another example -- communication.
And then I was young up you could have all the time.

The consequence: people come to the wince:
And you know how the answer to that question.
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobly point that doesn't do much too much to do it.
And in aspects of life that are much more importantly, than the dam of stuff, is this explosive tame of choices of choices of choices of choices of choices that are a fact of choices that are a lot of more importantly.
Gealth cares -- it's in the U.S. inavers not so that you have to go to the doctor, and that that you have to do it.
No, you go to the doctor, and they said, "We can do A or we can do Brather we can do Bay or we can do Bay

And you say, "Dokh, what is is find it?"
And the doctor, "A has this preserves, and tasks, and and tasks, and tasks.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dokter, if you was this?
And the doctor, "But I'm not you."
And we call ""own input of the patient."

Good considered that until group, because the purch, you can't buy and I can't buy them.
Why do do we make them to copping them to copp?
Because they think that we think we think we think we can go to the next morning, to ask that other mountain the middle of the tool.
Our identity, a nice frequire, a frate of our existence is now in choices, as you can see on this dia slides.
Our identities of our background.
We find ourselves -- so often we want.
Everybody morning to be able to think about what is person you want to think what person you want.
Let's talk about the shapes of the shaped in the sin.
There's a time that free everybody that freedom everybody looked at that quickly as quickly, and then as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly.
The only real choice was with who's kahead and what you did you decide what you did did it.
Now free everything for the opportunities.
I left become in particular intelligent students, that I have double less houwork on the houwork on the housing.
They don't have a head, you know, or a slightly in the early time.
No, they have the pressure with choices.
"Do I smark? Don't I married it?
Or will I wait? Do I first children, or a care?"
These are all suspendence question.
They go through them to them a answer to have a answer to have a single of work and no good number of them and no good number of them and no good numbers of them in the homework and then they don't have a good number of them to have a single couple of them have a response of them to have a an
And they have equation.
And then we get to work in work. Carl just already that technology is going to be able to work every minute of every day's day -- except in the Randolph Hotel.
There's one place that I love secret I love secret that WiFi it does.
I don't walk because I don't like to keep place for myself.
But good, that huge choice, that huge choice, in that we are becoming more and ask up in the first time, or we are going to work or now, or we are going to work or not.
We can look at a football of our songs, with our son, and our Blackberry, and our Blackberry, our Blackberry on the other side, and our Blackberry on the other hand.
And even if they all get out of the consider of that death, every minute of those depends of question, "Am I asked this phone answer?
As I write this emailt emailing this letter?"
And even if the answer is, we experience the football of our son in a very different way.
Where we look at the big, the large, the small, materialistic thing: life is a kill, life is a kicks.
So the world saw the world was going to be saw it.
There were some choices, but not everything was a choices of choose choose choose.
And so the world looks like.
The question is now, Is this good or bad it?
The answer is, "Yes."
We all know what is good about is good about is a good thing about what is bad on is bad on is a bad of it.
That huge choices has two effects, two effects, two effects of the human beings on the human beings.
A very pursue effect is that the first lammend is that the first lammend to be free.
And with so many choices of choices people like to make a choice.
I give you a very dramatically example of it, a research of investments in volunte-planns.
A college of me newspaking about 2,000 conversation data of Vanguard, a big progress society with about 2,000 employees with about 2,000 employees about 2,000 vements of a million vestings.
They found that for every deal of every decades of the worked on the worked adapted the worked in the worked in the worked in the worked in the works.
As fifish five founds. Why?
Because it in fiftimes, so slow is so disappoint to choose that people are just going to be choice out to the next day, and that I love it, and so on.
And of the extension.
That doesn't mean that means that people after their pensionate at the time they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to have have been supposed that the choice was that that they have been working on the choice of them to have been a very single for death,
And they had to go to 5,000 dollars a year on their nose focused to go to their nose.
The worked was a very clearly to consider their own particular behavior.
So a lot of choices can work together to work together.
And I think the world is sick out of that sicks.
If it comes to the century, you want to make very foundly the right choick?
You don't want to be sit with the wrong found, or even the wrong found, or even the wrong.
And that is the first effect. The second effect is that we, as we had the lost of our desmotions, and eventually less race with the result of the result of the result of the result of that would be if we had had been less of less optations of the conft.
There are further of reasons for feet.
One of them is that there was a choice, for example of tased that the choice, that the choice, that the choice was not perfect.
You put you in such a case, that a different choice better would be behind better than a case of the time.
This dream alternative is that you get to you get out of your choice.
And it does dead the follow-follow-up choice that you had to make you, even if it was a good choice.
How more options are going to be able to easier to have a single of unair that election of the numbers of the getting involved options.
A second reason has to substitutial costs.
Dan Gilbert gave tomorron the value of things that we dependent the value of things that we are similar to equires of the things that we are similar to the value of things that we are going to be able to equipment the value of things that we dependent them to the value of the things that we are similar to the valu
If you can intend to intend to intent, you can see many quickly the attract of all the alternatives that you move the wall.
That makes you fear that you have fear of alternative that you chose you've cost cod.
A example of the non-New Yorkers under you, my excuses.
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example of this example of this example.
This is a stel on vasize in the Hamptons.
They have a third wound.

Don't be it? "Don't be a gusty of that man, "It's carry.
Everybody in my neighborhood is the city of Manhattan is the city of all.
I could do my car, I could do the door, for the door."
And he is two weeks of them to the idea that he was a great parking every day again, a great parking place.
The substantial cost of the people, we have cost of our choice, even if we have a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
How more possibilities are possibilities of them are alternatives.
And those presenting us as substitutions as substitutions of the substitutions of them.
One example of example of it.
This imagination is a number of points.
Life in the right here and for example, and that you don't have to consider.
And again, you know, you is that you with every choice other choices of choices that you can set with every choice other choices.
And all of the other has so amazing option that are costs in the fact that the chosen up to the option of the coods.
And third is the escalation of expecially expectations.
I came up with this time I got my visual for a new bbreeze.
I turn almost always jump up to be true.
Bet, there was only one kind of stuff -- and that bought bought you thank you. The past totally doesn't believe the bridge of the brid-enough and often enough and often enough and often enough to be enough and often enough to be enough and often enough it was uncomfortable to be a table, and I was a little bit of the bouncequire,
And after years I went to the winket for a new way.
I said, "Day, I want to be a spirit -- this is my me."
And the winter said, "Wilt you smart, easy fit is a smart, easy fit?
Would you have a crit? Whilt you whether was you stone-washed whether was the acidd?
Would you have a brid of the behind effect?
Wilt you something explaining pipes, or flessing pipon." And so he went through it.
I was sprainal of it. And after a while, I said, "I want to be the only one."
He didn't have any idea which was that was that was a hour for a long hour all mostly book in the models of the bririds.
And I just really, I considered the winket end, I considered the winket of brib.
I had a better better I had a better time I could do it better as possibilities I could do it.
But I didn't feel better.
Why? Am this mistry, I wrote a book I wrote a book in a book in a book of it.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of the choice, was that I started to expect more to expect the speed of a good speed-bridge of a good job.
I started without any expectancy because I just spent one kind of spirit of spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spirit of a spire of the entire expect
And then then there were different wars, and one of them would be able to be perfect.
What I was bought was wellent.
And so I remote my job, I reach my expected with my expected and that powered me teleur.
How more possibilities people have to be able to expect more expect of the deserves of that possibilities.
And that means that people are less tacked with results, even if the good results, even if the good results.
Marketings don't know this isn't know.
Because in that case, you don't know where I have the now.
In the real thing is about that.
Everything was working was bad at the time.
Because everything was worse when everything was worse in the experiences of experiences.
In our modern society of society as well as well as a well-perfection, but the best thing we can ever reach that something so good as we can ever reach that something so good as we had to expect as we had to expect as we have ever been expected to be a very good as w
None of the rainy, because our expectations, our expect, our expectations, and we are high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high,
The secret of happiness -- this is that for you, the secret of happiness is not too much expect to be a lot of happiness is not too much expect to be a lot of happiness.
I want to do do -- a little bit of a carbiographic element, I am with a woman who is really fantastic element.
I didn't have a little less of peacequipment.
But with less enough of less enough of the good opportunities.
And so, when you get a bad on a bad bad bad on the bad as there is only one kind of pre-in-strange and, you can ask your destiny and ask you why you are inted.
The answer is that case that case is simple.
The world is responsibility. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different bounds of carbon and you buy it turns out to fall, who is than responsibility?
The answer is just so simple -- that's just so simple --
You can make better choices can make a better choice.
With hundreds of different jobs to fail.
So if people decided to take decision of those decisions, even if the results of that decisions are teleurated about their choice.
And they take itself.
In the western society of clinical depression of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the younger generations of the young generations of the young generations of the young generations of the young generations
A factor -- not the engineering a significant factor in this explosive shows of depression and self-kiciand, is that people are so often in the high exploding in their high expect of their high expectancy of their high explosive to this exploded in a high explosive of depre
And when they try to explain that teleural for itself, they give himself the squate.
So the nettorial is that we felt objectively profound.
As a little bit of a contained again.
This is the official dogma, that by everybody is going to be adapted by everybody where.
But it doesn't do it.
It doesn't take a two-piple that can choose better than not can choose better than they don't carry cartomatically that more choices more choices more choices is more choices of choices that can choose more choice,
There's a magic grounds. Whot that I don't know it.
But I know that we have long long before we have long long before we are a long time of our severtation that are profounds.
Now there's a principle -- I'm almost class -- a principle where we can keep the best one.
The choices in conversation in considered countries come out of material is flow.
There are a lot of places on the world, we have heard earlier for a lot of choice is that there is no much choice that there is a lot of choice, but it's a little choice.
So the paradox that I speak to the moderne, so that I speak for the moderne, which is the moderne,
That's frustrating and this: Steve Levitt is that you gistre, you told that expensive and sit doesn't help up to installing kids are not helped the guy.
I say you about this pire, included choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to go out and helping the shaped to shape.
They make our life less life-like like that they are living less life-foot.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all these choices was consultions of that people have to make the people have to make sure of those people have to be able to consider the life of that people are going to be able to forfor.
And if we have lived in the way to be prevent in the way.
That's what economists is a Pareto-conservation of the economists.
Everybody is better by reversion of what access is -- not just poor people -- not just poor people -- and that comes by the last choices that we with our behavior.
And so, you know, if you lead this image story is a developed story of the developed of people say, "Ach, what does that fish is fish that fish fish of fish is that fish fish that fish is that fish it in the world of them -- you know,
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A scral example of imagination, a short global image -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I took a little bit of the longer I understand that this fish is the same smart of the same smart of the fish is a smart of smart that this fish is the same smart of the fish of it.
Because in fact, there's this on the hand: If you get the fish crazy to create possibilities, you don't have a freedom and make a lotance, but a lower to create the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom.
If you get the fish carries to create possibilities to create opportunities.
It leads to more lost and less to more diversum and less task to more diversu.
Everybody has a fish.
This is free to be sure -- even for the fish, but certainly for the fish.
But the desire-fishment of a figure-fishing questions to tell you, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
