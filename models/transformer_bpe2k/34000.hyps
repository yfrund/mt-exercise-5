Last year I showed these two dia's to show that the poolics that the poolics that the last three million years of the size of the United Statand was 40 percent of the United Statand was crows.
But this is actually the serious problem because it doesn't show the divast of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The ice skapp on the North Pole, in a sense, is the square of our global climate system.
It's in the summer and crimpt in the summer.
The next slide that I shows is a accelerated version of what's happening the last 25 years.
The permanent, the permanently is duid in red.
As you can see, it back to dark blue.
That's the annual ice ice during the winter.
And the crimpt in summer.
The so-called ice ice ice ice ice five years or parent, is almost like blood, that is from the body that is going to be solid here.
In 25 years is it going to this in 25 years of this is going to this forever.
And that's a problem because the frozen frozen frozen frozen cound the Northern Icell and there is a very large amount of carbon that is frozen carbon the magn.
Comparing the total amount of diverse in the atmosphere, that could be double, that could be able to double, if we discribed the opinion of the debath point.
In some undeep a few undeep ming in Alaska signs of methane from the water.
Last winter went Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska with another team to another team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a different team to a dieversity of the U
Why! She's OK. The question is to whether we will be that we will be that be that we will be that are.
A reason for that, is that this huge called warm-warm-wheat Greenland from the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of "warm-shrored Greenland is wrong up.
This is a melt garden.
The water volume is the waterme larger than easy it.
This is the Kanger-lussuac river, in South Groenland.
If you want to know how the sea soundaries is because the landy; it's the landy; this is the place where it comes into the sea.
These straw pids are flight.
On the other hand, on the planet, on the South Pole, is the largest ice ice ice mass on Earth.
Last months reported the scientists of scientists that has now a negative ice balans.
More specifically is the ice in the West of the South Pole, very quickly to the south of the underwatering south.
The whole continent is to six meters sea stying, just like Groenland.
In the Himalaya, the two after the largest ice ice ice massas, there are new a few years ago, which was still glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half of his drinking water from that smell time.
In the Andes, is this glestar the source of drinking water for this city.
There are now more poaching.
But when they disappearing the drinke, the drinking.
In California was a 40 percent in the snow of 40 percent in the snowk of the Sierra.
It's going to get the water reservoices in the water reservoice.
And as you could read the predictions are the predictions are serious.
This global dreaming has led to a dramatic stye of forequal stye fuels.
And the number of course, the number of natural disappearing and never see face in a incredible and never see face speed.
Four times more time in the last 30 years than in the front 75 years.
This pattern is completely untable to be unentirely untable.
If you look at the both of a historical context than you can see what happened here.
In the last five years we have 70 million tons of CO2 tons every 24 hours.
25 miles ton every day in our oceans, look at the east of the Stille Ocean, and to each size from America, and to every size of the Indian is subcontinent, there's a behavior is a behavior in the ocean in the oceans.
The only big causes of the global warming, which is the earth, is to deforest, which is the burning for 20 percent of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the very largest problem.
The United States, is one of the two largest excellent in China.
And there was a proposal to build a lot more coal-coal-coal-coal-coals.
But we see a circummulate to.
These are the coales that the bunch of which the building became an numbered in the last years, and where green alternatives were pressed.
There's a political fight in our country.
The coal carbon and oil industire gave form year 250 million dollars to promote "sh" stepping coal coal -- which is a contradiction
And that picture was doing something that picture was thinking about something that picture was doing that.
And the Church, at me in Tennessee, about four billion gallons of gallons of gallons of challenged to believe
You probably seen it in the news of the news of the news
This is the one after the largest waste fall in America.
This happened around the Kerst.

He's paid is paid and employees keep their job."
Here is a big part of the coal in West Virginia from day's Prow Virginia

Al Gore: So the Alliance for Klimate, two campaigns on the road of catching two campaigns on the road of a too.
This is a piece of one of them.

That's why the reason why the most important goal is to give a giant engaging a giant engaging to the light and bring the light and the trick of the truth of the truth carbon the board of the stone carbon
Feit is, is not smaril.
We think it's clean is -- and it still work.
So, you don't make worries about climate change.
Let me just talk about us.
Video: Actor: Schone coal, you have heard a lot of it.
So let's take a look at this hyper-modern shoot carbon carbon centers.
Fantastic. The machines are making a little noise.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
In spite the fact that the breaking of steping coal of one of the most important causes of the Earth is the Earth is remarkable to the Earth is remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at the time is the shown carbon technology of today.
Al Gore: Einventually pitted the positive alternative in our economic challenges and that on the area of national security.
Video: Stem: America is the economy, the national security is the national security of climate crisis.
The red wire whether is our dependence of fossil fuels, like dirty of fossil fuels and immported oil.
But now there's a bunch of new solution to get out of this.
For America of 100 percent clean electricity, inside of 10 years.
A plan to get America to work on the work to the work is a plan that makes us safer and the warming of the Earth to.
And finally, a solution that are similarly enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. It's the way to get the way.
Al Gore: And the last one.
Video: Stem: It's about re-power to give America
One of the fastest ways to make an end of our dependence of old fuels that our planet fuels that our planet to help our planet to help see.
Man: Here is the future. Wind, a new energy system.
Man 2: New investments to create good paid jobs.
Stem: Repower America. Time to be realistic.
Al Gore: There's an old African speakword, "If you want to be so.
If you want to go far together."
We need to go far and fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year I gave a introduction about the LHC at TED.
And I promise back with an update about how that machine works.
So here I am -- for the ones who didn't waren't waren't the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever taken up, 27 miles in the biggest scientific experiment ever in the biggest scientific experiment ever in the biggest scientific experiment ever in the biggest scientific experiment ever in the biggest scientif
It has to be the conditions that were present to be less than a billions of second after the universe started the universe started to 600 million times a second.
Enorm ambitius, s!
This is the machine Genevve.
We took photos of that mini-Big Bangs inside detectors and this is the one where I work. It's the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wideline, 22 meter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in diameter in di
Spectarge-photo from ATLAS in the way that you can see the scale.
At 10 years of last year we put the machine for the first time.
This picture was taken by ATLAS.
That causes a partment in the controll-calculation in the controll.
It's a picture of the first particle couching that all around the LHC went all around the LHC and sit up with a piece of the LHCC, which was a piece of the LHC, which was a piece of the detector points in the detector food.
In other words, when we saw that picture at 10 September we knew that the machine, which is a huge over-in-in-in-in-in-winning is a huge over.
I don't know if this was the largest strong, or this this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the Internet page it looked like this.
That means we made a cultural as a scientific impact as a scientific impact --
A week later, we had a problem with the machine, which was to make with these golden behaviors.
They were about 13 thousand thousand amp-thousand amp-ended amp-ended amp-engineering machine.
The engineers will say, "Not true. It's too small dragone.
They can do that because they are supermoving in the very low temperatures.
So on minus 271 grades, colder than the space between the stars, that are able to behavior.
In one of the connectivated between nine magnets in the LHC, was a constructivated in the LHC, was a constructivity.
And that was a wire of the whearmer, and was insuddenly electric resistance against that 13 thousand amp-thousand amp-thousand amper --
This was the result.
This is even more than 20 tomowner if you realize that that magnets more than 20 tons of the road, and they were moving to be moved in the gare.
We damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them out of it, what we did we did.
We all have repared them all the time.
Now they're roads.
Eind map the LHC will be intact.
We will invent him again, and we expect measures in June, so we can go and figure it out, what the building of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, these uncidents the debate again the value of scientific research. It's easily to re-condition.
I think the fact that it's a hard thing that is so hard to go beyond the value of things like the LHC.
I let the last words of the English scientist Humphrey Davy, I would did, I think, during the value of the value of his learning, his learning, his learning was Michael Farather said, "None is so dangerous for the human mind of human mind to take our images of human mind than we are not to take our images of science in natural disconsient in natural world are completely new in natural world are are are completely new world, and that we are not completely new world, and that there are no new world's re,
Thank you very much.
I would want to start to ask you to ask you to your children, when you play with blocks
When you discovered how to grab it to grab them up, and they were conscious, you were actually solving it with the teaching with the ential relationship with the ential relations.
Ruimtely insight is concept to understand the world to understand the world to understand the world
If a information that if an inspired by the nut of physical interaction with objects -- -- with my adviser Pattion and my compassion and my compasion, I started to ask Jeed. What if we would ask me -- what if we would have a computer that -- what if we would have to ask -- what if we would have to do a kind of digital finger that moves on a plat a plate desing with the indivian individual information
and can order to order to want to be?
And this question lots of us so that we decided to look for an answer to figure out the building of Siftables.
Cort cookorge is a Siftable computer in the size of a cow of a cow-cooky cooky.
They can be moved with the hand they can feel their movement detect and they contain and they contain a screen and wireless.
The nuclear understanding is the physical traility, just like blocks can be moved by grabits, they can be moved by grab.
And the top of the top of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for the ways of digital information.
And that these are having a more physical different, becomes a more physical shifare of their movement and even of the way we move them from each other, and even of the new and nice interactions of the things that we move them to discover and nice interactions of their movements are in the way we move them from the way we move them from the way that we
I'll start with some simple examples.
This Sifttable is instony to tell a video that is playing by the size of the office and others and others:
These interactive portraits are consciously,
Indians next to each other, they will be interest to each other.
If they are surround, they can also notice this and can be a little nervous about it as well.
And they feel movement and hicless.
We realized algaue that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction, the use of all the time is the use of the magics of a color as it was a fluid of a color as it was a liquid of a color as it was a fluid of this interaction --
In this example in this example of three Sifttons for and I can use them to go color in a empty in a empty of the empty of being mixed in a empty in this example of the things that they become mix.
If we have threw over, we go, we go.
There are some of the criple of the education, and mathematics and logic that we have a language and logic that we want to give people possibility to proted, and the result that we want to give people to be immediately, and the result immediately,
And here shows -- this is the development of a Fibonacci acci account programative computing.
Here we show a game that is a cruise between Scrabble and Boggle.
The principle is that you get in every Sifta letter at every Siftable, and shaped words are being controlled in a dictionary.
After about 30 seconds, it's really rehabited a new series of letters with behind a new series of letters with behind operating opportunities.
Thank you.
These are some kids on the Media Lab, and I contemporary it and I contemporary them to try to make it and make a video of it.
They were really away from it.
And one of the most interesting things that is that people don't need to have instructions.
Everything you have to say is "Mo's word" and they know what to do.
Here are some other people to testing it.
That's our youngest bye-ster Juish.
And it turns out that he was just going to stack the Siftables would.
For him were just blockes.
Here is being shown painting a painting.
We wanted to have a platform for learning language to learn from language to learn from language
This is Felix that demonstrate.
He can bring new characters in the scene of the Siftable with that characters of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table of the table to get the table of the table to do the table of the table to the table of the table of the table to the table of the table to do acters.
Here he let the sun operating the sun.
Video: The sun is going to be up.
David Merrill: Now he's got a tractor in the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of the scene of David Merrill:
Video: The orange tractor.
Good thoughdan! Yeah!
By the shifting of Siftables and the needle to each other, he can responding the characters to each other.
DM: and so his own storytells.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with an open end.
and he decided to decide how it goes away it goes away it goes away it goes away it goes away it goes away.
Video: The cat flies away.
DM: The last example I will show today show that I will show today and live music tool, and live music that we developed recent that we developed recent a sound producing like the lead, bass and print.
Eennion, in engineering has four different variations, where you want to choose what you want.
These ludge Siftables can be injected in the pattern so you can determine the pattern itself in the pattern itself.
You put a sound in the pattern by the pattern by the way of a spring Siftable effects are live controlling and filter.
They are being being an accumulated and provide by the sided.
And if the general effects like temo and volume that are being admitted on the whole pattern.
Let's see.
Video: DM: We start with a living in two Sifttables, to a first pattern, to a first pattern,
Now I put the basline.
Video: DM: DM: Now I add a little slagwork
Video: DM: And now I coping the filter on the drums, so I can affect the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect live the effect of the things that are going to affect the prints, so I can affect the effect live in the drums, so I can aff
Video: DM: I can get it very accelerating the celerating of the tempo blocke.
Video: DM: Now I cope the filter of the bas for what more expression.
Video: DM: I can reaching the pattern as it is playing it plays.
So I don't have to plan, but I can improvise everything I can improvise it very much more like I want.
With the dimmaking the dimmmaking the volume Siftable to the left.
Thank you.
Like you can see my passion from to make new people to make new people in the way our brain and interfaces that are devoted in the way our brains and bodies the way our brains and bodies.
And today I had the time to show you one new element in this design region to a few possibilities that we are developing in the lab.
The thought, I want to bring about is that this is just the attention to a very new generation to a very new generation to the interacting with digital media that information to our world as we want.
I thank you from hard.
I look at it to talk to you with you all of you know.
I'm writing.
Books writing is my work, but also so much more than that.
My entire life for a long time I am writing writing that ever will change it.
And yet there is a property in my life and carrier in my life and carrier that I had to be a relationship with my work again.
It started a book that I wrote desires a memoire: "E, Biddy, which is very very much in contradiction to my first one work and an international exister and an international exister cellerately in the world was contradicted,
The consequence is that people now have to go all over and always teged me as if I do job.
And that is what -- gets do!
People come to me and ask care to me and ask worrying that you will never be able to equar?
And if you don't fare that you will keep your entire life but never will be a book like to be published to be in the people for warm.
Are you going to focus on that.
And it was restituted, you know.
Of course, that would be very remember that I was remember 20 years ago, I was a teenager, I was when I told I was writer.
People said, "Are you going to have you never get succes?
Are you to deal for education, that you will be supposed to it?
You don't know you are going to be your life to this work without that there ever something that has ever something from that you will be something from your broken to the puin of your broken bittere?"
Something in that streting.
And in the short is my answer to that "Ja"Yes."
Yes, I am afraid for all of these things that are called "
All of the time already way.
But I'm also a lot of other things job, you don't know what it was all of the things that all of the time.
For sea weer for example, and other engine, and other things.
But what is writing writing myself the last time I write that fear comes froms.
Is it rational?
Is it logical that somebody is to be afraid to be joined to the work for that they have been taking to their opinion on Earth is a conversation?
What is so particularly in creative processes that we make us to make the effects of the mind-estesaged gone to others at all.
Take my father. He was chemistry ene, and I can't remember me that there was a chemist, and I didn't work.
And that's how to you chemistry, how do you get your chemist?"
No, no, there was no matter of the getting touches.
To be fair to be fair beekey engineers have been making the reputation of the reputation of manical depressive alcohosts.
You know, that have such a kind of reputation.
Not just writer, also other creative people have to be pretty instable, the reputation operations.
But look at the grimp of death the most magnific creative minds of the 20th century.
Many diet of dierves, often by own own stiled by own own own stidens.
And even the ones who don't have a suicide pleasures to be under their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be suicide their gave to be under their gave to be under their gave to be suicide to be suicide their gave to be under their gave
In the last interview for his death said Norman Mailer: "With every one of my books is a piece of minds."
That's pretty much to say about your life.
But of this kind of exciting we don't look at the time.
We all have heard it all before, and have heard it with my all accepted.
The majoring thought is that creativity is unlocked up with suffering and that a poor, and that an artist will lead to misere.
And that's why I want to ask everyone today you have to be living with that idea is living to live in this idea of living to be living to this idea of living?
Do you do that OK?
Because now I think about it, I think it's not a good thought, I don't think it's all a little thought.
I think it's the resident of the resident.
And even even dangerous.
I wouldn't like this century, this is going to be so far as well.
We can be able to do a lot better than to be able to live a lot better to life.
I know that it would be in my situation, in my situation, particularly in my situation, in my mind-contemporary to live to that dark as a thart of the dark thought.
In fact, the phase of my career is in my career now.
Go too: I'm just young, amper vehicle years.
I can spend four decades.
Hharvesting everything I now now now now is going to be putting the outside world as the work that was completely to be the extraordinary book.
We're here with friends under each other, so I can be able to you can be sells my greatest success is my greatest success alone.
Jemig, what a idea!
If you think about this is the time you know at the morning, you know at the tends to the drank.
So I don't want to do that.
I love to the work that I love with the work I love of the work I love of the work I love forever.
The question is, "Hoe?"
And after a long time I think I have come to the conclusion that I can just go to write with writing a psychological protection in the process of building.
I must be writing a safe distance between myself and my connection between myself and my conversation in my future publicly to the reactions on my future publishing published to my future publications.
I was looking at the last year to ways of doing that.
I am in history and I do do a lot and have me in other civilizations to see if others have found or others to be able to help creative people to help creative people to go with the emotional complications of creative process.
My quest me has been brought me to the old Greeks and Romens.
And then you know, because it's a long and complicated story.
In the time of the old Greeks and Romons, people didn't believe that creativity was coming from herrself.
And they believed that creativity was a god-convernment, which is a display, unched to the human beings was a display for reasons.
The Green records called this calls of creativity "demonen" of creativity "demonen."
And Socrates believed that he had a demon who had a demon that words him words to fluistered him words.
The Romeinand had a species of idea.
And in fact, in the conduct of a creative minds' geniously.
The funny is that the Romeinand a genius with a genius to a genius to be a particularly pularly pipment of a genius
In their polartistic god-a genion of magical godd-entity that was in the walls of the ateler of the artst.
A little bit like Dobby the house of the house.
When the artistic was working the geniion of the geniion of the genius --
And in fact, he gave form to work.
Brilliant! That's exactly the distance I had the first thing I had it before, the psychological protection to the results of your work.
Everybody knew how that was working in his work was going to be work.
The artists was taken in protection to a lot of narcism.
If you were brilliant work was brilliant to be all of the honor for it.
Everybody knew that a invisible genious geniius you have helped it.
You know, you know, you cut up, that not just to you.
Everybody knew you had a rather intouched genius.
Lange time is that been considering the West, creativity.
And then the Renaissance, and everything changed changed.
And there was a very new ideas that is the individual human ideas is the middle of the universe and state all the gods and mysteries.
No space for mystical creatures, attacted from the godd-size world.
That was the beginning of the rational humanism.
People believed that creativity of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual came out of the individual
And for the first time in history was about the artists said they were a genius and not that they were a genius and not that they had a genius
I have to say that I think a big mistake.
And to one person, one person, one of individual to believe that he if she is the vehicle is the crule of the century of the century of everything that didny, of everything that is too much responsibility to a fragiment, is a lot of responsibility for a fragic human psyche.
And like you ask somebody asks the sun in swell.
Egos are being blown up to gigantic proporations and there are are imposed to prestic proportional to prestate.
And I think this pressure has made the last 500 years of artists cot cottles.
And if that's so -- and that is asking them, "What now?"
Can we do this?
Can we go back to a parent understanding of the relationship between the relationship between the and creative mysterile?
Maybe not.
We can make 500 years we can rational humanisn't un-done in an 18 minutes, in a 18 minutes,
Probably sat the public people who are recently remaining scientific people who have been refrigged to some feeent the work of the work of artists of the work of artists of the work of artists of inspirting high tape to inspirting the work of the inspiring of the idea that eless.
It doesn't seem to me that I will get you in that way.
And yet me deal with it.
Why not?
Why wouldn't we have that thought don't think about it?
The foot is so much as much as all the other explanations of the total gecalculations of the total calculating process.
Everyone who has to try to create something -- so in fact, so that we actually know the creative process here -- you know that the creative process is not always rational beard.
And that sometimes the paranormal.
I have recently the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer Ruth Stone of the great American closer to the great American closer to the great American closer American closer to the great American closer --
And she is a thick in the nine. Her entire life already writing.
She told me about her childhood, on the plant of Virginia.
Some times, if she was felt the job, she was felt to the land.
It was so so told you to row a big wave air wave air
And so that is poem about the country to her --
She felt that the ground underneath her feet started to shake her at that point, and her at that point, and to her life.
She ran home, back to home, and she had to do as fast as possible and she had to do and packs.
When it poeoem by her honor her honor was that her only was her only to write it to write it up.
Sometimes she wasn't fast enough.
Then and rough, but it's reaching the house is not reaching the house.
And at these moments the poem of her him, and then square about the many of the many -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- to another poem -- to another poem -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her words -- in her
And also also had a lot of the story -- this is the most beautiful part of the story -- that they were almost dise the poem --
And then she was in home and paper and paper the paper and paper the poem by her ons.
Just at that potle-had had a pack-too.
And with her other hand, so she told me she was told me to the poem from the sky.
She took the poem with his tail, and it back in her body, and it back in her body, and she wrote it up.
And in that cases came up with the poem of well-beat paper in the paper and then it was dealthy in the end,
When I heard that -- I thought -- what happens is accident, my creative process ook!
And that's how my creative proces! I'm not a medium!
I'm a mouth, which every day on the same time when every day on the same time -- and sweeping with blood, sweand trans it through themselves and tranaround.
But even in that day-soogled in that day-like experience of a experience.
You will also know it ourselves that feel that sense that there are creative ideas in your source from a source that you can identify impossible to identify that you can identify impossible to do it.
What is that then for brone?
How can we use it without that we get it without a little crazy?
And in a way that is good for us to is?
The best contemporain example that I can think of this is musician Tom Waits.
A few years ago, I interviewed him for a magazine.
We had it to do this.
Tom is actually a big part of his life to be showing the shows of the crazy artists that from all power to get the power grip of the power of the unconcerns that are impulses in him of the impulses in him of the impulses in him.
With the 190s, Tom some more rustant to be a little bit of the rustate.
One day he in Los Angeles over the faster and changed the process of radical process radical.
And as he was there, he heard a fragment, he heard a melodie.
The decided that is doing it, like inspiration that does deal is degrapitable, wellent.
It was a beautiful melodies and he wanted to fashion.
But that was not going to do that.
He had no paper tle, no paper, no tapperecorder to the tapperecorder to the tapperecorder to the tapperect at the tapperecorder to the tapperecorder to the tapperecorder to
The well-known exciting took again is called "I got the melodies, and then it stays and then it stays me century; it will stay me behind the century."
I'm not good enough, I can't do it."
He didn't get a little panick, but he stopped that whole mental process and did something new.
He looked up to the sky and said, "Sorry -- "Sorry -- you can't see that I sat the sense of the stuff behind the sense of the stuff --
"Do you really think I can write a songle one,
If you really want this song that this song to get later you have to do when I have time for you,
Don't do anyone else to be disconfalls.
Go a neighborhen-up Leonard Cohen." And then that moment when the process of the process of very different.
The work is the work is the same thing that is the most known dark subject.
But the heavy exciting that the creative process in him of the creative process in him of the geniius.
The genion was going to close to the sit and supply just up.
Tom realized that there was no reason to go to the bottom of it.
It could be a wonder, bizarre collaboration between Tom and the property, a kind of conversation between Tom and the owner aspect that was not all of Tom itself.
That story has changed my way of working.
I had been profit of it.
I was in the middle of Ets, Biddary, Biddy,
At a point of point I agreement in despad.
You know that you know, you don't want to do a good job and you think it's a terrible disaster disaster is going to be a terrible book it.
Not just a little bad really horrible bad -- really bad.
I wanted to do the whole project all of the project.
And then I remembered to be that his genius, and I decided to way.
I wish my manuscrips and direct me to a empty of the room of the room of the room.
And I said hardopying, "Lister thing, we know all of that if this book is not only by me.
You can see that I have to go into what I got in my thing.
More doesn't make it.
If you think it's better to get to be better than you have to get your thing.
You know? Do you don't know that you don't --
I just write because that's my work.
Oh, and in the notils are being solid that is going to be a chance."
Tja--- eventually it comes up to the notice here.
Eeuwen ago, in the North African desert people to make a malight to monthlide to a monthlide music.
And eights and hours, to the morning to the morning bounds.
That was always great, because the dancer were completed professionals.
But sometimes, sometimes happened to be something extraordinarily --
One of those dancer than transcendent.
You know that you know what I mean, you ever have ever seen something that you ever see something that in a performer.
It was like the time was stilling and the dance of a port stepped stead.
He did nothing else than the thousands of nights -- but now I was now took everything together.
And all of a sudden he wasn't a human being.
In him, above him, above him it gloes --
A godddly him.
And if something happened when you were happening, knew people who started to clap them and clap them and clap it and calling clah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
Because that was for them.
By the way, a nice of historical fact, when Moren South Spain South Spain this way.
The outcome, the outside is the centuries of the centuries of "Allahs in "Allah" in "Oly."
And that is the way that you have today in the fighting and flaments and flaments
If an artest in Spain Spain a something impossible, or magical does, "Allah, oil, ost, Allah, right? Allah, great.
And the way we can see diseas: a glimpse of God.
Precions we need to have to have a resident.
Lasty is the dance of the dance of the next morning to the next morning to the under day to be 11 in an o.D.
At that moment he's a little parent man with retaining cludes that will never come to such a little highs will never come to such a little elder to such a little elder to such a little elder to such a little bate.
Maybe there will be no more somebody God will be rown for a little bit of this:
What does he have to the rest of his life?
That's hard.
That's really hard to selling to selling for a creative mind.
But it's so painful high not have to be too to be there.
Imagine that you don't want to get the most unusual aspects of your person from you.
Imagine you believe them that you have a while to be a while to specification of a not naught source.
When you are ready with it, they get given to somebody else.
And that's how to considerate everything.
I hit to the middle of the dad.
The last months I worked on a book that will be soon, the book that will be short to a lot of a long time to refrigerately to be checked out of a book at a book that will be sketched.
The operating that illuster progress.
When my thoughts with me to the hall, I love me the same one, I keep the same one: I don't know it.
Do just work.
Just just do you do thing -- which is also what it is.
If you are task, you know, dance you can dance you do.
If the god-contemporary genius is advitted to the work at some point, at some point, you know, the major source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the wonderful source of the well.
And the way that we don't have that this: I think it's going on.
And then said, "Oly!"
I believe that of hard.
"Oh, anyway, anyway, because we have pure human love, because we have human love and propertly, by staying the stay of the stay of the stay of the pure of the pure of pure of the pure of the pure of the pure of the pure of the pure of love human love.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects, about some of these projects, about human genome and what that can mean, and what that can mean, and what that can mean of new sets of genes.
We actually started to go from a new point, we were the biology to digital and now we are trying to go from that digital code to a new phase in the biology and the design and synthesize of life.
So we always tried to ask the big questions.
"What's life?" is something that I think have been trying to understand the way to understand at different levels.
We tried different approaching, it bring to level back to the minimal components.
We're almost 20 years to the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitize the digitize of digitize the right now.
When we have sequenced the human genome of the analog world of biology, to the digital world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we try to ask life to regenerate, or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest genome for a kind of that can conceive themselves in a laboratory.
And we tried to look at if we can get a nature smaller genome.
We can go to the order of hundred of them out of the 500 or something, which are are.
But if we look at metabolical map, is that relatively simply compared to the one.
Gelood me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can check per piece of the things that this could be a living cell of life cell that this would be a living cell of living cell of the genes that this would be able to switch a living cell of the genes that this would be a living cell cell of the genes that this would be a pone.
And we decided that the only route that the only route was to synthesize this chromosome of the most of components to do the components to the components to be able to ask the most fundamental questions.
And so we started asking questions, "Can we started a chromosome of chromosome of the synthetis?"
Staat the chemistry, to make these very large molecules that we never seen before?
And, if we do that, if we do that, we get a chromosome "st?
A chemist, by the way, is just a piece of chemical introduce material.
So, our tempo of the digitalizing of life is accelated on exponential way.
We have to write the genetic code to write the genetic code is rather slowly, but it's really advances.
And our last point it would be placed in an exponential curve.
We're starting to have over 15 years ago.
There were some of a couple of stadisconnecting a bio-ethical keeping the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of DNA is really hard.
There are teens in the world that make little pieces in the world that small pieces of DNA to 50 letters in length and it's a degenerative process, so how longer you make it piece of the more fals.
So we had to make a new method for the condition of these little pieces and correct the correct of all the errors.
And this was our first pogone, to start with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174.
That's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the pieces, we did the pieces, did the wrong correcrector
and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting part of the began when we put a piece in the bacteria chemists in the bacteria genetic code, and the bacteria genetic code, and make viral particles went and make making the genetic code,
The viral particles were going to be when they were solsing out of the cells, they came back and deaths the E. coli.
I was recently in conversation with the oil industry, and I said they can be model.
They laughing more than you.
And that's why we think this is a situation where the software can build his own hardware can build in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something much bigger.
We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosom.
That's over 580,000 letters genetic code.
And that's why we decided to build them in cassetes, so we could do the cassettes that we could vary the cassettes --
to understand what the actual components of a living cell cell.
The design is crucial, and if you start start with digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that digital information in the computer than that are very accuraate.
When we first first of this genome to the first time in 1995 was the standard precision one mister was one mistake.
And finally, we found after resequencing 30 fales. If we had the original sequencing sequence, it was not able to start.
More of the design is the design of pieces that are 50 letters that have to be a long time that have to all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so that they can get together, so they can go and make it together.
We design here unique parts in the world.
Maybe you have read watermarks.
Bethinking this: we have a four-letter-genetic code: A, C, G.
Trios of those letters code for ruwway 20 aminozurs -- that there's one one of the single of every aminoxygen --
So we can use the genetic code to write, though.
At of the signs we only get to be able to do it.
Some of them were teleurated that there were no poems.
We have these pieces are so designed that we can eat them with enzyms.
There are enzymes that they repairing and put together.
And we started to make pieces of calls, and start with pieces that five to 7,000 letters long, only that they were to each other, and you have pieces of 24,000 letter, and then sets of 24,000 letters,
In every stadium weeks we were able to flow a overfloating so we could sequences them because we want to create a process that very robuy -- that will be very robuy -- that will be very robuying --
We're trying to achieve the point of automatishing the point of automatishing.
So this looks like a basketbale.
Once we get to the real big pieces -- more than 100,000 basepares, they don't grow so easily more in E.
which is the most of the modern tools of all modern tools of molecular biology.
And that's why we went to other mechanisms.
We knew a mechanism that "homolo-o-combination called "homolo-to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA can feet.
Here is an example of that.
There's an organism called Deinococcus radioduransodurans, three million radiation to the radiation of the radiation of the radiation of the radiation.
That is the top panel, which is the top panel, som just sopm just sopm from each other.
12 ots hours later he put it into the one one another, exactly like it was first of all,
There are thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be droomed up.
They can live in a vacuum at a vacuum --
I know absolutely sure that there can be life in space, that can be able to move the moving, a new aquatically.
NASA has shown that there is a lot of the one of them out there.
Here is a determine micro-phon-molecule that we made with these processes -- actually actually in the right design with the right design of the right design of the chunkest design of the pieces that we did.
Great cartomatically.
This is not an electron-microscope photo; this is a ordinary microscope photograph.
It's such a big molecule molecule that we can see it with a light microscope.
These are photos, taken about a six seconds.
This is the publication that we recently extended to expand
This is over 580,000 letters to genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by people, with a clear structure.
The molecule is over 300 million.
If we would take it with a 10-point letter, without spations, without spations, then there is 142 pages to the genetic code.
Good, how do we started a chromosome of chromosome of the activit?
And with a virus is a clearly pretty easy to be pretty easy.
And by a bacteria is much more complicated.
It's also simpler when you give you under eukaryots, like we just know the cell that we just know the cell out of the cell and that's what you know when it was the reading.
In the bacteria species of the chromosome of a cell, but we have recently shown that we have a complete transplant of a chromosome of a chromosome of a chromosome of a cell to another one, and it can be able to another one, and it can be able to an another, and can activity.
We have a chromosome of a micromosome of a microbed of a microbes
These are about as far as people and mouse people and mouse.
We feed some extra genes so we could select this chromosome of this chromosome of the chromosome of the way to do this chromosome of the one.
We have reted, we reached it with enzymes to make all the proteins.
It was pretty sensational when we put this in the cell -- and you will be able to do this very advanced graphic images can be value in the cell.
We even thought he would come to come to solid to set it out to be a process of what we were going to go out and do what we were going to go out and we were trying to do it in a process of what we were going to come out of the process that we were going to get out of the process that we were going to do it in a few of it.
This is an essential evolution mechanism.
We discovered all sorts of species that have a second chromosome of third chromosome of them or a third thousands of properties in one time to the species.
People who are evolving evolution as if there are one changes at the same same way of magame.
There are enzymes that are restriction enzymes are called DNA enzymes that are really going to make DNA
The chromosome of the cell was in the cell was not there.
The cell -- the chromosome that we stopped -- we put it in it.
It became express and the recognized the other chromosome of the material, it was therefore and so we finally had the cell with the new chromosome.
He was blue because he was put the genes that we had stop.
And in very short time disappears of the one species, and changed he completely completely in the new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell we put in the cell in the cell we stop.
All the proteins changed, the membranes -- when we changed the genetic code was in which it was changed in it changed.
This is a magine alchemistry, but we're in straight by changing the software DNA, to change the software DNA, to change fundamentally changes.
Good, I've been paid earlier that this is not a creation -- this is not a creation -- this is the signs of evolved, and I paid was a new version of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of the Camban explosion of new species that are making new species of that are enable.
Why would you do this?
I think it's pretty clear as you look at what's needed to what's needed to what's needed it.
We're going to go inso-and-a-half billion people, for the next 40 years.
And to put it in my context to put it in my contexting.
There are three people on this planet.
for each of us who lived in 1946; within 40 years that there are are four years.
We have display with food, with the carry of water, medicine, fuel for the six-and-a-half billion.
That's hard to do that for nine.
We use five billion tons of coly, over 30 billion ves:
That's 100 miloons of oons of freezing a day.
When we take biological processes in ogency or which is also to replace that is going to be a huge challenged to be a huge challenged challenge.
And then there is all that carbon dioxide of the stor that come in the atmosphere is going to get in the atmosphere.
And by the future, we have a database we have now have a database with about 20 million genes, and I would like to see as the design components for the future.
The electronicaindustry had had a dozen compons, and look at the diversity that is from that is prevent there.
We're constrained by a biological reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques are fast synthesia methods to do something called combination genomics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes.
If you think about the process of 20 million different genes, or try to optimize processes to optimize process, or drugs to produce or drugs, new vaccins, new vaccins, we can change with a small team we can change molecular molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's only a standard selection.
We can select select for livbirth or fuel production, vaccine, vaccinproduction, and so forth.
This is a screen of what real design software where we work, so you can really go to the crowd, and a new kind of on the computer.
We don't know about how it will look like this.
We know how their genetic code looks like.
We focus on fourth generation fuels.
And the way that we have seen fine to ethanol to be a bad experiment.
We have second and third generation fuelds that will come out to more and soon as sugar to more fuels like sugar to more fuels like octano.
But the only way we think that biology can have big influence without the food higher and the availability to reduce the availability to lay the CO2 as his food, and that's why we are food to design that we are doing it in that way, and we think we are doing that way we do the first fourth generation fuels in about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 is one method -- but by our world's discoveries -- but we have all sorts of other methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep-sea and a half miles deep, at coal-coal-coaling temperature temperature --
It makes methane of molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen as energy source.
We're looking at the way we can take CO2 CO2 which is easily through pipes that are easily fabulous to the fuel that CO2 to field-fashion to fix this process.
So in a short time spoke we think we're able to expand we are able to break out of the basal question: "What is alive?"
We reality, we have a real -- you know -- the protect purchemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED where you can do this, where then where?
A major energy source to be a major energy source to be a major energy source.
But we're also working on the case of these tools to be able to think about quickly servaccines in vaccines.
This year there was the flu -- we always walk just something behind the facts of the vaccine.
I think that can change by the shape of forward vaccines.
And here you see how the future can see that the evolution tree is going to change the evolution tree, the accelerating evolving with synthetic bacteria, and eventually eukaryota.
We're still avoid away from people.
Our goal is to ask that we make a chance to survive long enough to survive that probably you can do that probably do that.
What I first to you as first to show you is the fundament of a new technology that we brought to Microsoft rosoft about a year ago. This is Seedragon.
And it's a environment where you can lock local or at the distance with immense amounts of datual data can work.
We look at the gigabytes to digital images and can sit down to the solid of the case on the magniff and challenges.
And it doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information we can be these collections or images.
Most of this is normal digital camera photos, but this is a scan of the Library of Congress, and in the 300 meapixel of the 300 meapixel
It's all about nothing because the only thing that the only thing that would affect to be afflud, on a third-like system pixels on the screen.
It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a completely book, a completely book, a kind of non-image data.
This is the graue house is by Dickens. Each column.
And to prove that it is really texty, and no image, and no imagination, we can do something that is really texty, to show that this is really textile is not an imagination.
Maybe this is a little bit strange way to read a way to read a e-book way to read a e-book --
I wouldn't recommend it.
This is a realistic. This is an example of The Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a submarine of a submersible.
This is really a join the job and the experience of a real paper of a real paper of time whether is actually a scaling medium is.
We also have something that we have done with the corner of the Guardian.
We made a np advertising of high resolution -- much high than a normal advertising -- and we have extra information -- and we brought extra information --
If you want to see the possibilities of this car and you see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specifications.
And these ideas can really make sure we can really make the limitations of hands, we can do the screen through the screen at the screen to do the screen
We hope that this is not a pop-ups and other such flawwwell, not needed to be more than needed to be more than needed to be more than it would be more than to be flawwwell,
Of course are a maps of course application for a technology like this one, I won't spent time to spend here to this field, except that we can contribute this fields.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
and put on top of the NASA examption of the NASA
Let's look at something else.
This is now the way to the Web; you can look at it.
This project is Photosynth, which two techniques two techniques together.
One of them is Seadragon and other is a very beautiful piece of computer vision by Noah Snavely, provening the University of Washington,
and Rick Sself, Research. A beautiful call. A beautiful cooperation.
So this is live on the Web. It's measured by Seadragon.
When we do this, you know, we can see that we experience the images and the multi-resolution resolution to it.
The space source of the images has the images are the images here is meaning.
The computer vision algorithms have these images, so they were bring the real space space -- the Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rocks, where they are genome. And so you see of elements of stabilized diassions of stabilized diassified diassions are space
I'm not sure if there's other environments.
There are still a lot of space that are more space are a lot of space.
I want to show one of the Noah's original data-sets -- and this is of an early prototype of Photosynth that we worked this summer -- to the the environments -- to the the real power of this technique, at the realm of this technique of this technique of the environments on our website.
We had to keep account with the lawyers, and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Damams with images from Flickr. You just look for Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickr, and you get images of people in Flickly shirts, and the campus and the campus and the campus and you get a campus and the cample and you get images of the Notre Dam.
And each one of these orange chests gives a image that was part of this model.
And so these are all Flickr images, which are in this way of spending in this way of spending --
And we can do a simple way we can do a simple way to do it.
You know, I had never thought that I would have ever worked at Microsoft
It's overwhelmed to be so define.
I believe you can see that this is a lot of cameras aris: everything from globe: everything from good-mirror reflexcameras a big number of thing, suming in this environment.
I'll try to find some strange images.
There are so many works and so many of the faces and so on.
And somewhere between a series of photos -- this is a series of pictures --
This is even a poster of the Notre Damam, that is churged by the program.
If we have the poster in a physical image of this environment.
What we want to say is that we can really do things with the social environment. This is now the data of everyone -- of the entive memory of the entive memory of the Earth is looking at the Earth is to each other.
All these pictures are being constructed, and shapes a very little bigger than the som of the parts.
You have a model that from the whole Earth of the entire Earth is going to deal
So as a consequence on Stephen Lawler's work the Virtual Arded.
And this is something that growing in complexity when they use it as wells the progress for the people who use it.
Their own photos are being provision to somebody else else somebody else else else.
If somebody would like to climb and their names and their names and their names and their names is going to be able to the Notre Dame is suddenly really, and that I can use as a access to the space, which I can use metap-veral versus of cruise moded, and created with this kind of cruise model, and created social experience.
And of course, the be-product of this immense rich virtual model of every interesting place on Earth, which not only from the sky-photographs, satellite images and other applications is destroyed from the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did I understood that makes a little software possible on a day, in the next years, all the images that can be dead by everyone on the world that can copy?
BA: Yes. What this really does is discover that.
It is creating to your wish, hyperlinks between images.
And it does that based on the data in the images.
And that is defining with the wealth of semantic information that is semantic information that much of these images are available to have a lot of these images are available to do a lot of these images are available to do a lot of these images are semantic information that is available to the wealth of these images are seequaling things that are availing in a lot of semantic information that is dead extend to the wealth of semantic information that is a lot of these imagines a lot of these imagines a lot of these imagines of these images of things that much of several information that much of several information that is ged as being severse
When you look at the web page of images, you put a search in the web, and the text on the web, and the text on the web, a lot of information about what the image image we agreement ath,
What if now is copied to all your imaged images?
And then the number of mility semantic connections and the amount wealth that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of that comes out of that is a classic networks effect.
CA: Blaise, that's really incredible. Gefelicized.
One of the intense pleasure of travels and of enographic research is the possibility to live in the old lions of those who are not forgovernment, which are their past prod, the touchest stones, the profits, the profits, the profitting in the profiters.
The science that Jaguar-shamans still traveling the Milky Way Way World World old is the myths of the inextensive in the Himalaya booddhim still make yourself in the breathing that we are really really, at the anthropology is not a real thropology of anthropology is not a casking, but is the only one of the anthropesis not a single of the entry,
the consequence of a chance that we have adoption to make our ancestors generations that make our ancestors generations ago.
Of course, we all parts of the same regulars: World World World children in the world.
We all make all infortune that we all make infortunately.
And so the intent divergency display by death.
So it can't be surprising that we all singing, dancing and art it.
But interesting is the unique cadans of the song of the dance in every different culture.
Or now is the Penan in the Borneo, or the Vood-Colys, or the Vood-A-Coly's Desi, or the Caisut in North Kaisut desert in the Andes-bound-boundor the Curs-ban ara temporary of the Sahara. This is the guy -- this is the making of the Sahara.
Everest, the god-mother of the world.
They all us learn we can think different, different, we can think different, we can think of orients.
If you think about it, you can only give this idea you to just give this idea you to just hope you can only hope.
Samen the intelligentable cultures in the world a web of spiritual and cultural life that the planet and for her just as important is as important as the biological lives, the biosphere.
This cultural livweb you can imagine as a etno.
The foot one, you can define as the total of all the thought, if the total of the thoughts, myths, and inspirations and inspirations that are predicted by the human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness since the beginning of our consciousness.
The etnoise is the big nalatenacy of humanity.
And she's the symbol of all of that we can be as an amazing news that we can be as amazing curious animals that we can be species.
like the biosphere is the biosphere is the etno. And the etnosed is that equal -- and even in much larger mate.
No would be a biologist would be conversation that at least half of all the species of the species of extinct of extinct that is simply not true true is not true true to be true of the point of the point of all the species of the things on the point of extinclude at the point of extinct of all the species of the point of extint, because that's not true where
And the most optimistic scenario scenario is not even in the neighborhood of the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity.
The best indicator of this is the loss of this is losing to languages.
When everyone born to the single became a little bit of a thousand of languaged to be on Earth.
A language is more than her word-grammatical rules.
A language is a front of the human soul.
It's the vehicle that is the sicl of every unique culture the material world.
Every language is an ancient ancient ancient ancient an old old old an ecosystem to spiritual opportunities.
From that six-thousand becomes a day the day of not more in children's ores.
They are not being tolded babies are not being touched babies
Effective means that unless a change that they are already to be dead.
Is there something to be conversation than to be bigger by the last of your people, the last of your people, and you don't have any chance to spend your language or the promiss of the ancestors of the children must be?
And the reciipe is somebody's dead every two weeks somewhere on Earth, because every two weeks of them to be an older and with him dieded him the last letter of an old language of an old language language
Some of you say, "Super, we don't like the world are not better when we all the same language if we all the same language of the same language of the same language. Or Kantones. Or Kantons.
Or Kogi.' You will realize you realize how it could not be able to talk to your own language to talk to you.
So what I really want to do is to you on a short journey by the etnonosphere, which has to be an image of what in fact, which is a picture of what in fact,
Many of us forgovernments that when I have become a different way of being in a different ways of too.
Take me this Barasana-child in the North West Amazone, the people of the anaconda, which is that they believe that she believe that she believe that she is the food, in the buI think of the east snake.
This is a completely that cognitive the colors and the blue and not the cognitive of the magine of the odd of the odd of the odd of the odd of the odd of the odd of the odd of the oddddly.
They have a copinient language and regular, which is called linguisuistic exogamy exogamy -- you have to somebody who speaks a different language.
This has become roots in the mythological past, but the particular become in their homes, where six or seven language six or seven language of these crueling crossing market, but you never hear practice somebody heards in a language of nature --
They are simply listening and begin to speak than speaking.
One of the fascinerended strains that I've been lived with which I was living the Waorani in Northeast Ecuador, a amazing bluffing in 1958 freedom.
In 1957 tried to explain five missionaries are contacting to explain a critical falt.
And it is the air, they friendly photos of themselves with our ideas that they go to our ideas to our ideas to the people, which they had never seen a two,
They got the photos on and tried to find the shape behind the face.
When they found, they found, they concluded that the duivel that the double with this -- where the missionsionaries were going to spend with spare.
But the Waorani didn't only expressed, but also each other.
For a percent of their death-covered measures from the breakfast of their deaths
We could be able to eight generations to eight generations back to eight generations back in which we found two cases, where we found two cases,

And Voodoo is simply the destilling of this deep-religious ideas as as as the tragic diaspora during of the tragic diaspora during the slavery.
What voodoo is interesting is the living amazing between the lives, and dead the dead and dead the dead of lives, and the dead of the lives, and the dead of lives, and the dead of lives, the engineering between the lives, and dead the dead of life,
The lives, the minds.
The mind can be toos to be under the Great Water, to the dance that the soul of the living in the life of the living time so that that that in the soul of the time that one of the magnitude is the god.
That's why are the churchests deaths are going to talk to the Church and talk about God.

This leads to a amazing tone, Vood-volgelations in trance that straffic elects that bluffeless.

At this point is intuitiva very important.
If we think of inhead people, we often farmy, we often Rousin and the old fabulous fabulous fabululous because a idea that is racistic in his simplicity.
Or we half, and say that these peoples are peoples at the Earth is closer to the Earth is than us.
Inhead peoples are completely nor is nor expect by nostalgy.
For both is little space in the malaria moers of the Asmat or the icic wind of Tibet. Desalnotary wind from Tibet. Desalnotary of the Earth is a traditional mystic of the Earth that not aware of the Amazed is based in in a much subtle of the Arged to a much subtle of the Adomain the idea that the Aroman is the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea of the life's lives.
What does that mean that means a small child from the Andes, which is grown up with the belief that the mountain of the belief that will lead or her defend, a fundamental other relationship that will have been a small child in Montana, and a other relationship that will have a small child from Montana, which is a little kishing.
Or it the living, or a lot of it, or a lot of it is irrelevant.
Interestingly, the metaphor that defines the contention between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia Columbia with the idea that these forests were to become a little couple of the forests of the idea that these forests were catched to the idea that these forests were crazy in the forests of British Columbia with the idea that these forests were going to be getting getting geevolved.
And that made me another one of other people, I think that the Kwagiul-thing, who believe that those forests the living of Kuxwhue and the Kromme Snavel of the Hemel and the Kromme Snavel and the canner that in the north of the world that was swwwalling the world.
These minds are important to their Hamatsa-in-inducation.
And when you start to the idea that these cultures can be able to separate different realities that can be understanding for some of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture that I april right in the North West Amazone nam.
This is ayhuasca, the most powerful psychoactive willing to the repertoire of the repertoire of the shaman.
What ayhhuascinating is so fascinating is not just the pharmacology potential to it, but how fascinating, but how fascinating.
Enereas there is a wooden that beta-carboline, harmaline and harmaline in itself and light light hallucinating light hallucinating hallucinating light and sings light hallucer is going to be a wheart and sheart hallucinating hallucinating and squaring hallucinating hallucinate.
If you only take the plant following the blue that a blue smokalm by your consciousness.
The plant is being mixed by a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee of a coffee --
The plant is powerful tryptamines, nauverbecause to the brain serotonine, dimethyltry-ptamine, 5-methoxyltry-ptamine.
Have you ever see the Yanomami as they have snut, that substance of different species that of different species that too?
That powder you can get your nose in blads, as a gever, proted, proted, and the narrow pictures to a sea of electricity. This is not a distortion of the emergency of reality, it is unlike a distiny of reality.
I tried my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, to convince -- a man who did the psychedelic era in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I paid that these tryet are not to identify as hallucinating as hallucinating, because when the effect are intricitted hallue to experience the hallucination to experience the hallucination is not oral oral to take his not oral in the human dark because they are defend, by an enzyme in the human darming,
They can only be oral oral to something that the monoamine of soamine of soamine effect.
The fascinating is that the contain the light carbon the lide of the gaps are in the light of the gaps are to activate the tryptamine. Imagine the question to do this in a flora of 80,000 plants of two morological untable species that are combined species that are combined in the shapes that are larger than the shaping the shaping of the shape that is larger than the shape of the parts of the partment that are larged squarter of the shape that is is is is folding in the shape that they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they are larger than pared spect
We say eufemistic "trial and it ror," which is like a meaningless.
The Indians say, "The the plants talk to us. The plants talked to the stem means that that that the Cofan, knows 17 variants of ayahuasca, who can identify all of the major distance that they would have to have onto our eyes as one of the straight of the straight that they would be money.
If you ask their taxonomy in map, they say, "I thought you know something of plants.
You know about all the way at allenge at all?" I said no."
And it turns out to all the 17 species in a night in a night in different toone, in different towards of towards in different towards of the tape of the taneously,
You don't promote at Harvard, but it's a piece of a piece of tells.
Now, the problem is that even the ones of us who are sympathic contradiction of ine-in-foot people, but conducted to a footnature in history, but the real world, in history as the real world,
The truth is that the 20th century is not remembered to be his war to be a war or his technological innovations, but rather if the era in which we stone, and active participiled to the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. The problem not change.
All cultures have always been sharing a dance with new life possibilities.
Technology is not the problem is not the problem isn't the problem isn't the problem.
The Sioux-indians are not Sioux indions when they were their pile, when they put their pile, just as message; when they stop, they were to be Americans to be when they were their horse and way.
It's not change, or technology that the integrity of the equal novel of the etnow; it's power.
The wrun of the government.
And what you see in the world, you will notice that it's not the fate of these cultures to disappearing of these cultures to disappear.
These are dynamic lives, whose are being identification is being identifying by identify that their approaches to their approach.
Or this now is about the huge amount of the Penan, a nomadic Southeast Asian nomadic people, and the last generation in the forest, and the last generation in the forestablished and now reduced prostitution to the river and prostitution to the river that the river, where you can see the river that the river of Bore,

In the case of the Yanomami are the disease that are inside as a result of gold's discovery of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go to the Tibean mountains where I do a lot of research, you see the face of political government.
Genocide, the physical excellent of a people, but equal regulation of the life of the living, but it's destructive of a people, but in many places even four-of-stop and becomes in many places even four--part of a development strategy.

I have a young colleague in West-time in Cengdu in West-China to Lhasa.
And then when I came to Lhasa was in Lhassa statistics that you hear about it.
6,000 Heily monuments destructed 1.2 million people destroyed the Cultural Revolution.

The pain of Tibet can be untouch, but the confree of the people, is something to do you to do the fast of the people.
And finally, it comes up to a choice.
Willen we live in a gray world of the unital world or want to be a color do we like a color do we like to deal of diversity?
The big anthropologist, Margaret Mead said to her death that we direction a general amorf world,
We would not only be the human imagination constraints to a small model, but we would have to be ademodes and forgotten that there are other option, there are other options.
We can feel us in the idea that our kind of just about [150,000] years on Earth.
The Neolitic Revolution, which we gave our agriculture in the way we gave to the shad, when the power of the shaman was replaced by the prossa of the priester and we had a specialization and we had a specialization by specialization of the priests.
The modern industrial world is not a 300 years old.
This is the surface history is not gives me the idea that we have all the answers that we have all the answers that the next millennia to our path.
If the intelligentle-up cultures of humans are being asked to the meaning of people, they answered with 10,000 different voice.
And it's in that song that we will discover again that we will discover what we be: a completely species that is a completely species that assume to be able to make all the gardens and all the gardens of optimism.
This picture I have a in the northern point of Baffin Island taking with Inuits on narwal --
This guy, Olayuk, told me a beautiful story of his opa.
The Canadian government is not always been friendly for the Inuit. In the 1950s, to be able to produce our sout, in the 1950s, to produce our soutings.
The opa of Olayuk concerned to go.
The family for his life and determine him already his cars, all his tool.
Now you have to understand that the Interin not afraid to the col; they made it use it.
The glions of their sleets were originally made from fishing fish in carguments of carguments
Olayer was not afraid for the poolnight or the storm that became the storm that high.
He went out to out; he showed his breeding skin, he was poeping the poop began to be women's hand, he started women's dealing it as a limmet.
He brought a low-to-beat the sides of the side of the side of the well.
When the solid, he was a dog of them.
He recorded the dog and improvised a harnahs.
From the ribs made a bad of the rib.
He was looking at the dog and he was going to be and disappeared on the ice foot of the ice foot of the ice food.
And this is solid to nothing in a lot of ways, in many ways, state of the Inin the resistance of the Inin and all the income in the world.
In april 19999 gave the Canadian government the Intermine of a piece of country larger than California and Texas saming our new home. It's called our new home.
It's independent. They are reverse all the ground stones.
It's a amazing example of how a nation is enough enough to make people to her people to her people can be able to make her people to her people.
And finally, I think it's clear to this high is clear, at least for who is the world is required, that they actually don't really get away to get away to away.
They're somebody's home.
They are about the human imagination, which is going back to the beginning of the time. And for us all the time. And for us all of us -- the dreams of these children, just like the one, part of a un-in-defied geography of hope.
What we finally do at National Geographic, is extend to be reaching the idea that politicians never reach.
We think that polemic -- we think that a polemic not convincing the world, but we believe that storytellers the world, that we probably have the best tellers in the world is probably about the world, we have been in 156 million times a month -- we are in 156 countries on the magazines a million-public.
We make a felt following to the enovel nosphere, with our public place, to such particular particular beyond the task of the task is so imated, with what he sees hopefully away that we can go to deal with what he sees that this world will be able to live in a different to live in a way to live in a way that we can find a way to live in a multiulal and plual and plualistic world
which all of the people, is that all the people, can be being saying to our conversation of our conversation can be being seen to our consult the way that all the people.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about some question of which I recently asive to a book that I have changed.
Maybe you can see paralls with information from other sources.
Let me explain some way I also took some of the connecting you that you might have a memist.
I want to start with the official dogma."
To be exactly to be exactly the official dogma of all the Westery, interested society.
And that official dogma is affect to the prosperity of our citizens of our citizens at the highest level of our citizens as much of individual freedom.
Freedom is a big good part of the human beings part of the human beings of human being.
And the top of the such that is able to deal to treat its own inses, to do a higher which is to reach a higher which is to achieve no insiders.
The ultimate freedom we find in choice-possibility.
More choices love in that people have more freedom.
And more freedom means automatically more prosperity.
This is so deeply in our society that nobody would be on it.
And also in our lives is this dogma step of a support of the support of our lives.
I'll give you some examples of our modern choice.
This is my supermarket. A tool.
Even about dressings.
And at the time that 175 changes are threats of the supermarket, there are in my supermarkets of a virgin the end, and twalf different treatment.
And that is that you can make a tiny of the case of the case between 175 species for you,
So that's the progression of my supermarket.
Look at electronics store. You can put your stereoset -- loud of the cassettes; cassettes; cassettese, cassettes;
And in the one electronicawink's good-to-language store.
You can do six-and-half million different systems, with parts of parts from that store.
Give -- you have a lot of choice.
Another example -- communication.
When I was young for a long time ago, you could ask all kinds of phone services, but only at Ma Bell.
You solid it out. You bought it.
That was the way that it had never been the device never got to get piece of the device.
And that time is forever.
Today there are a lot of different conceptional stitutions.
And in cell phones is the diversity is immens.
These are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- which is the middle -- that with the middle of the major and crative brander and crative break a fun fun of the fun fun of the major fun making a fun making such a brand-player,
And if you don't have this model that model in the winke, but you can be sure that that that's happening.
The consequenc: people come to the winkle and assume this question.
And you know how the answer to that question aw?
No.
It's not possible to buy a mobile of that doesn't do too much do a lot of too much do it.
And also in aspects of life that are much more important than the attackle of stuff, this explosive is this explosive increasing choices a fact of choices a fact of choices that are much more important than the persuain the way of choices that are much more important than the period of the stuff that are much more important than the one-such aspects of choices that are much more important to be more important to be more important than the feat.
Gealth care, it's in the United States is in the United States, and that you go to the doctor, and that you tell you what to do.
No, you go to the doctor, and they say, "We can do A A or we can do B.
A has this front and tasking.
BB has this and, and what do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, what do you find you find it?"
And the doctor says, "A has this front, and the But, and the But, and the But,
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Doctor, if you was going to do you?"
And the doctor says, "But I'm not you."
And we call that "own investing the patient."
That sounds very positive, but means in fact, that the heavy of decision is shifting someone with somebody with somebody with somebody -- the doctor -- the doctor -- the doctor, somebody who is free to definitely divery, and not the best condition to take the patient. For on recipal measul measures is much more advertising a lot of advertising become much more addition of addition of the recivent measures of the joyful measurespond-mains.
Good dead described that ners, because the purch, you can't buy them.
Why do we make them?
Because they think that we think we are going to be to join our doctor to ask that other branch that other brand mean to ask that other branch for the other branch for the other branch measure.
Our identity, yet a printing aspect of us are now over-up, is now overbulated to choices, as you can see.
Our identity is that our identity,
We think we are ourselves out -- so we just want.
Every morning to the opposite of the opposite to be thinking what person want.
Let's talk about the marriage, the family.
There's been a time that freezes free everybody from the car from the thing that quickly as quickly as possible to children as possible to children
The only choice was who was who was who was not when and what you do was doing --
Now is free everything to get up.
I just give me a particular intelligent students, which I would have become less houwork on the way than huwork than the early.
They are not sand-whether or lue-time or lucky in the early time.
No, they have it making choices.
"With or not? I’m marries? I now?
Or will I wait? Take first, or a career or a career or a career e?"
These are all conditional questions.
They go through to an answer them to an answer as it means that they don't get their homework and not make a good catch as well.
And they have right. They're important living questions.
And then we get to work. Carl gave as a way of work that technology is able to work every minute of every day and work, where in the world -- except in the Randolph Ho.
There's one place, by the way, which I love secret that I love the Wii does it does.
I don't walk like that, because I want to keep that place for myself.
But anyway, that huge choicy choicy of work in that we are wondering, or we go and ask up and then we'll work or not.
We can look at a football of our sone, with our sone, with us cell phone, and our Blackberry on the one hand, and our Blackberry on the other hand, and making our laptop at the other hand.
And even if they all are, we get every minute of that wheat all of the questions, "Am I ask this phone answeren't answere?
Is I like this email-mail-mail-mail-mail-foot me?"
And even when the answer is "Nee" is, we experience the football of our son's son's son's a very different way.
Where we also look at the large, the small, the materialistic things that is living style, life is a matter of choos;
And this is the world used to look like this.
There were some choices, but not everything was a question of choices.
And so the world looks like this.
The question is now: Is this good or bad bad or bad bad bad?
The answer is, "Ja"Yes."
We all know what is good about is good to talk about is a lot of what is bad to it.
That huge choicy has two effects, two effects on the human beings on the human beings.
A very contradiction is that the earlier paralyzed than confreedom.
And so many choices people find the harness to make a choice.
I'm going to give you a very dramatic example of the investigate in volunteer pensioent.
A colleague of me access to invest investment data from Vanguard, a big polgation with about one million employees about one million employees about 2,000 employees about 2,000 fings.
And they discovered that for every 10 policy foundary foundary the work-took the work-took two percent touched the particular two percent
At five-farmed front of them disrupes than five percent of five than five sounds. Why?
Because it was in five-foundaries so hard to choices that people people are just like the choice to the next day, and that on it, and that on it, and that on it, and that on it, and that on it, and that on.
And from the exposed to the point is degraded.
That doesn't mean that people don't have any time to retions of their pensionate, because they have not been enough money because they have been made enough money was so hard to have a job as hardly so hard to do it.
They were going to be able to 5,000 dollars a year to their nose nose.
The work-working was willing to double.
So too much choices can be paralyzed paralyzing.
And I think the world looks like this.
If it goes to the century is you really want to make the right choices, right?
You don't want to be sit with the wrong phone, or even the wrong three.
That's the first thing is that we have to have the laming laming the laming laming of our disources, finally less to the result with the result of the result than it would be when we had fewer options of options as we had fewer options as we had fewer options of our way.
There are multiple reasons for the reasons for doing it.
One of them is that there is a choice, for example, from tiny to the choice behind the choice was not perfect.
You ask you such a case of that one would have been better in a case would have been better in the way.
This dreamed alternative is that you get to you get to you get to your choice.
And then does the front of the choices that you have made you in the choice you made it, even if it was a good choice.
The more options there are the more options of being being able to have a museumber, which is election of the chosen options.
A second reason has to do with substitutional costs.
Dan Gilbert gave with the morning, and how often we depended on the things that we depend of the things we compartment.
If you can think of the alternatives can be intended to be able to see many alternatives that you determine the entivate that you defense that you wouldn't be determine your desire.
That makes you less task you are the alternative that you have chosen you've code.
A excellent New Yorkers who are the non-New Yorkers --
This is a little bit of the stretch of this example.
This is a couple of the Hamptons.
They have a these. They have a second wrong.
They are a beautiful strand. Stralend again.
Don't do it? "Don't do it," thinks that man, "It's augusty.
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is the city
I could do my car for the door, for the door."
And he's going to do two weeks and the idea that he was a great parking place that he was everyone one else in a great parking place for every day parking place
And substitutional cost of the people, even if we have our choice, even if we make a great choice, even if we make a great choice.
The more possibilities are there to be more attractivities are going to be there are are going to be there.
And those are presenting us as a substitutional costs.
Another example of the example of the example.
This is a picture stories to a number of points.
Life in the right here and now for example, and you don't have to do things at the time.
Another point is that you can get with every choices of choices.
And all of that other has so his attractive optional cooses, which the cost option is being less attractivity.
And third is the escalation of expectations.
I came up to this is my search for a new own.
I turned out to be able to get stuff to be able to get up with it.
And it was a kind of stuff was just one kind of stuff you know, the past. The paste total totally not, it was incredibly uncomfortable to be the breet, but if you were able to wast, felt the ball of the ball of the time and felt enough to be able to do it.
And after years I went to the winke.
I said, "Day, I want to be a stuff bill, this is my me."
And the winkely said, "Would you smart, easy fit or relaxed fit or relaxed fit?
Would you knotons or a rhyth? Whilt you was a crit?
Do you want to get a blown with the slide effect?
Would you exwalking out a little bit, or whether flink out, and so he went on and so he went on.
I was spotlacket of it. And after a while I said, "I want the only one-one-foot that was used to be there."
He had no idea which was that was and so I have an hours all the possible once of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power to passes.
In fact, I just explored the store of the winke, I just exploring the store.
I could have done better than that. And I could do it better. I could do it better.
But I didn't felt me better.
Why? To this to myself, I wrote this to myself, I wrote a book of a book of a book of a book of it.
The reason I didn't feel better with all of that choice, was that I started expecting to expect of a good joining of a good job.
I started without any expectancy, because I just started one kind of spalong of spalong of the spirit of a spalone.
And then then there was different and one of them would be different from that would be fast perfect.
What I was bought was good but not perfect.
And so I compared my job, I was my expectations, and that asked me teleur.
The more possibilities, people have to have more expected to be cow-desertions of those possibilities.
And that means people are less too, people are less too, even if the good results.
Marketing people don't know this not.
Because in that case, you don't know what I'm talking about.
In the really goes to be about that.
Everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse.
Because when everything was worse to be worse to people could have a lot of experience.
In our modern society we can be able to expect as well as a well perfection -- but the best thing we can ever achieve that something that we could ever achieve that something is so good as we expect to be as good as we expected.
None of them are touch, because our expectations, my expectations, and high high high --
The secret of happiness -- this is not too much -- the secret of happiness is not too much as a lot of happiness is not too much as a lot of happiness --
I want to ask -- a car biographic elementally -- that I am with a woman who is really fantastic.
I didn't have asked me with her less textile with less texting.
But with less enough news has good opportunities.
And finally, when you have a bad bad on the poor tracks, if you have a bad of predicting, you can ask you why you can do you ask to why you can do that ask you why you are untask to why you can be untask to be untouched to be a bad
The answer is that case case care simple.
The world is responsible. Because you didn't have choice.
But if there are hundreds of different trick, and you buy it turns out to fall, who is responsibility?
The answer is so simple. It's just as simple.
You had a better choice.
With hundreds of different greenhouse to fale.
So if people decided to decide even if the results of those decisions, they're good dealing about their choice.
And they take themselves.
In the Western society clinical depression under the younger generations.
A factor -- not the enia, but a significant factor in this explosive increase of depression and self-explosive increasing experience is that people have so often telegars have been so often television to be high expectances.
And when they try to explain the exhibitself, they are trying to explain themselves the wult.
So the nettoress, so that we spoke to go forward, but we feel the worse of it feeling.
Another a container of a containment.
This is the official dogma, that by everyone to where becomes ening.
But that's not.
The list doesn't make a choices can choose be better than they can't choose to be able to choices that more choices is more choice.
There's a magical boundaries of choices. Welely, I don't know.
But I know that we're already for a long time for the point that choices us are well-being,
Now, there's a principle -- I'm almost ready -- a principle where we can keep our best to keep the best one.
The choices in industrialized countries is prevent countries comes out of material overfluence.
There are a lot of places on the world, we already heard about where the problem is not so much that there is too much choice, but there are too much choice.
The paradox I speak to the modern, so the moderne, well-well-well-being, well-behavior for the modern,
That's frustrated, and it's like this, and you know, Steve Levitt you have yesterday told you yesterday and sit is to installing children.
I say you about this sure, this supposed choices -- they don't help -- they don't help to get hard.
They make our living.
If a part of what people in our society is able to make all these choices to make all these choices of people have to have a lot of these people are going to go on and go to the life of that people are going to go on and go on and go to it.
And also our lives would go on it.
That's what economists call a Pareto-improvement.
Everyone is better by reverse reversion of well-of-freedom people -- and that is the key that we are with our choices that we are with our our way that we care.
Finally, you read this image story -- if you read this image story like a developed says, "Ah, what does it knows that fish?
Nothing is possible in a fish."
A screal imagination, a short squarile worldview -- that was my first interpretation.
But the longer I told about it, the better understanding that this fish is the same one is the same smart.
Because in fact, there's this to the hand: If you get the fish crazes to create opportunities, you have no freedom, but lamine.
If you get the fish calls to create opportunities, you get less to create opportunities
It leads to more disconnect and less beyond a lower textility.
Everyone has a fish.
This is free certainly constitutes -- possible for fish.
But the susity of a figural fishing is questions to ask miserable, distributed, unheil.
Thank you for your attention.
